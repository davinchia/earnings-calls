Ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for standing by.
Welcome to today's American Express First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's conference is being recorded and information on accessing that replay will be given at the end of today's conference.
With that I'd like to turn today's call over to our host Mr.
Ron Stovall Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead sir.
Okay thank you Dave and welcome to everyone.
We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion.
As usual it's my role to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release which is filed on an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release and Earnings Supplement as well as the presentation Slides all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings with a series of slides included in the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dan completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&amp;A period.
Up until then no one is actually registered to ask questions.
While we will attempts to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call we do have a limited amount of time.
Based on this we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&amp;A.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay thanks Ron.
So let's start on Slide 2 Summary of Financial Information.
So total revenues net of interest expense was $7 billion up 7% compared to last year and that's 5% on an FX adjusted basis.
Income was $1 177 000 000 up 33% from the prior year.
EPS was $0.97 and Return on Equity was 28%.
So revenues while not robust were an improvement from 4% growth in the fourth quarter and are better than what we see in the industry.
Let's go to Slide 3 Metrics.
Start off Billed business.
The Billed business was up 17% on a reported basis 15% on an FX-adjusted basis.
So this is the fifth straight quarter that we've had Billed business in the 15% range.
And the first quarter of 2011 is the strongest first quarter in Billing in American Express' history both on a reported and an FX basis.
Looking at cards-in-force it's up 5%.
We had growth in GNS of 14% and in the U.S.
Consumers Small Business Group growth of 2%.
Average basic cardmember spending continued to be strong at 13% growth on an FX-adjusted basis and cardmember loans were flat basically with last year as loans have stabilized which is a positive.
Worldwide travel sales is really being driven by air sales a combination of both higher average price and a higher number of transactions.
And we're seeing that both in the Corporate business and the Consumer business.
So let's move to Slide 4.
So this is Billed Business Growth by Segment and as you can see by the chart we continue to have strong growth across all of our segments.
The U.S.
Consumer Small Business Group grew 13% the International Consumer business on an FX-adjusted basis was 10% Global Commercial Services 17% and GNS 24% for a total of 15%.
If we move to Slide 5 this is Billed business Growth by Region and again as you can see on the chart all geographies are having strong growth.
In the U.S.
growth was 15%; in EMEA on a FX-adjusted basis 10%; JAPA which is Asia on FX-adjusted basis was 18%.
Now within there is Japan and the growth rate in Japan has declined.
We've seen an impact on Inbound business but we still have double-digit growth in the Japanese market.
And Latin America and Canada grew 16%.
So if we move to Slide 6 this is Lending Billed business compared to and as well as managed loan growth.
So spending on lending products as you know is no longer correlated with the growth in loans.
And this is due to the fact that we are focused on premium lending.
We have significantly reduced balance transfers and there's been a change in cardmember behavior since the recession.
Now if you look at the lending trust units you would see that paydown rate continue to increase.
So in March of 2011 the paydown rate was 30.4% and that compares to March of 2010 when it was 27%.
As you can also see from the chart as I mentioned before the loan balances have stabilized.
So next we move to Slide 7 so this is USCS net interest yield.
Now historically prior to 2009 the net interest yield was generally in the high 8% to 9% range.
In anticipation of the CARD Act we increased prices and you can see that reflected in the bars related to 2009 as well as the first quarter of 2010.
As the Credit Card Act became effective yields as we expected has started to migrate back towards historical levels.
But in this quarter the yield was 9.1 compared to 10% in the first quarter of 2010.
So this decrease is resulting in a decrease in net interest income.
So moving to Slide 8 which is our revenue performance.
We see that discount revenue is at 14% Card Billed business was at 17% and some of the factors contributing to the 14% growth was the fact that GNS Billed business is growing faster than the average as we've discussed before.
Billed business on GNS is lower than on proprietary business.
Also we have a number of Contra-revenue items including corporate incentive payments partner payments and cash back rewards which are deductions from discount revenue.
Now the discount rate stands at 2.55% the same level as last year which is very good.
Now as we know going forward as the mix of our billings changes to more everyday spend we would expect the discount rate to decline.
However over the past 3 years it's held up very well.
If we look at net card fees you can see it's up 3%.
We actually had an adjustment in the first quarter of $10 million for $11 million.
So excluding that it's relatively flat.
If we look at travel commissions and fees of 18% essentially being driven by air sales as I discussed on a prior page.
Now Other Commissions and Fees are up 6%.
And here we have foreign exchange conversion revenue increasing based on higher spend.
We also have 1 month of Loyalty Partner revenue and that's offset by lower delinquency fees.
If we look at Other revenues which is up 12% we have higher GNS partner royalty revenues higher merchant related fee revenues higher foreign exchange fees and higher global prepay revenues.
And net interest income is down as our loans are flat and the yields that we just discussed are lower.
We move to Slide 9.
So this is Provision for Losses.
So Charge Card the write-off rate in the first quarter of this year is the same as last year.
Receivables are about 11% higher.
Now Charge Card provision is a little lower here as we had a modest build in reserves in the first quarter of 2010 and a modest reduction or reserve release in the first quarter of 2011.
So Charge Card as you know has performed very well during the recession and now that we're in a recovery period.
Now looking at lending provision is $800 million lower year-over-year.
It was $688 million in the first quarter of 2010 and is actually a credit of $120 million in the first quarter of this year.
Now there are two factors.
1 is lower write-off rates and the second is the larger reserve release.
So the write-off rate in the first quarter of 2010 was 7% and the write-off rate in the first quarter of this year is 3.7%.
So write-off dollars in the period are about $600 million lower.
In the first quarter of 2010 we had a reserve release of $485 million and in the first quarter this year we have a reserve release of about $700 million.
So $200 million greater.
So credit continues to improve we're improving faster than the industry and write-offs are below historical levels.
Next I'll move to Slide 10.
So here in the beginning I'll basically talk to the first three columns on the left-hand side.
The comparison of the first quarter of '11 to the first quarter of 2010.
Now we do have total growth and expenses of 19%.
And that's a combination of what I'll call business-as-usual expenses.
1 item in rewards which I'll explain in a minute plus we're investing to build our business momentum going forward.
And that's really being enabled by the strong Billed business volumes improving credit as well as the Visa and MasterCard payments we received.
So we can see here that marketing and promotion is up 15% year-over-year and I'll discuss this in a little bit more detail on the next slide.
At the moment I'll skip the rewards line then we'll come back to it.
Salaries and Employee Benefits increased 15%.
Employees are up about 3 300 from last year or about 6%.
We had an increase of about 1 400 employees compared to the fourth quarter 600 of those relate to Loyalty Partners then we've had increases in technologies enterprise growth as well as world service.
It also reflects merit increases higher benefit-related costs and increased incentive-related compensation accruals.
Next we'll look at Professional Services which increased 18%.
This includes technology consulting on development projects higher external sales agents in Global Merchant Services and higher legal fees some related to the DOJ suit and some related to our acquisitions.
Other is up primarily related to some accounting related to some foreign exchange and interest hedges which I'll talk about on a later slide.
The other thing I'd point out at this juncture is the fourth column which is really showing the change in expenses in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.
And I draw your attention to marketing and promotion which is actually down 15% from the fourth quarter as well as Professional Services which is 27% lower than the fourth quarter.
So here we see expenses trending down from where we were in the fourth quarter.
So let me talk to cardmember rewards expense which is up 27%.
Though a portion of this is simply the 15% growth that we see in spending by cardmembers the other portion relates to the Membership Rewards program.
We continue to improve the Membership Rewards program and its value proposition.
We've recently added a number of new redemption options including Amazon and certain other digital redemption options.
We are seeing greater customer engagement by the current program participants which is reflected in an increase in redemption patterns.
Now as I've said in the past higher redemptions and higher customer engagement is positive from a business perspective.
Cardmembers who are active redeemers spend more attrite less and we have a higher share of their wallet.
This program is attractive from both a cardmember and shareholder perspective.
We continue to refine our estimation process for the calculation of the ultimate redemption rate.
These refinements are captured in the recent increase in redemption patterns by our current program participants.
This resulted in our estimate of the ultimate redemption rate for current participants increasing from 91% at the end of last year to 92% in the first quarter of 2011 which resulted in an increase in the MR reserve of $188 million.
Going forward we will continue to refine the ultimate redemption estimation process as cardmember behaviors in the program evolve.
So next I'll move to Slide 11.
Now here we continue to have high levels of marketing which again has been enabled by strong cardmember spending improved credit and the Visa/MasterCard payments.
And while the first quarter of 2011 is lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 we are above historic levels and 15% higher than the first quarter of 2010.
The areas we're spending on in the U.S.
Consumer Small Business area are acquisition of charge and premium lending cardmembers and loyalty investments including partners payments.
The International consumer is focused on acquisition and loyalty spend stimulation and in Global Merchant Services it's a combination of contractual merchant payments merchant loyalty spend perception of coverage and brand advertising.
Moving to Slide 12 so here we're going to discuss a number of investments that are recorded in operating expense.
Operating expense which are basically excluding marketing and rewards increased 16% 14% on an FX-adjusted basis.
And we can see that support functions in global services are growing more slowly than the average.
Now above the average are 3 bubbles that are growing as a function of the investments that we're making to drive future business momentum.
So we look at the upper left we see new business initiatives.
And here we're focusing on driving fee revenue.
It includes investments in LoyaltyEdge online and mobile Accertify Loyalty Partners and Business Insights.
If you look at the next item it's sales force investments both in Commercial Card and the Merchant business.
If we look all the way to the right we see variable technology investments and these are technology investments to develop technology solutions in both our core business as well as our digital advancements.
Now there are two other bullets 1 simply has to do with spending for bank holding company in Basel II regulatory requirements the other has to do with accounting for our debt and FX hedges.
Now here I may give you more information that you actually want but our FX hedges are functioning as designed.
So what we want to do is basically lock in our U.S.
dollar net income.
So in the first quarter of 2011 the U.S.
dollar weakened.
As a result revenues and expenses are higher therefore net income in higher.
And in this case we actually pay on the hedge and so it's an expense.
In the first quarter of 2010 the opposite happened.
The U.S.
dollar strengthened therefore we reported lower revenues in expenses and therefore net income.
In that case we actually received the payment which is a credit on this expense line.
The other item is our hedge on our fixed rate debt where we convert have a hedge that converts the fixed rate debt to floating.
And again this hedge is functioning exactly as we intend.
Accounting requires us to mark this to market.
So in some periods we have an expense some items we have a credit.
So again here in 2011 we have a debit last year we had a credit.
Now these mark to marks at the end net to 0 and so there's no economics to it.
I went through this long explanation because a combination of these things actually had a negative year-over-year effect of $50 million.
So now moving to Slide 13 so this is Expense Flexibility Over Time.
So these are expenses excluding provision and they're expenses as a percentage of total revenue net of interest expense.
Now we recognize that we are currently at elevated expense levels and again this is being funded by improved credit and Visa/MasterCard payments.
Now that it's likely that the benefit in credit provision from credit reserve releases will diminish going forward and the Visa and MasterCard settlement payments will phase out in the second quarter those are the MasterCard payments which are $150 million per quarter and the fourth quarter which are the Visa payments of $70 million a quarter.
As result of that we are as a go-forward we're moving forward with plans to slow the growth in our operating expense toward the end of this year and into 2012.
So we would expect this percentage to move down as we go forward.
So next is Slide 14 so this is Charge Card Credit Performance and here we can see that USCS write-off rates are the same in the first quarter of this year as they were last year.
In International Consumer and Global Commercial Services we can see that they've been pretty consistent over the last several quarters.
The higher amount in the first quarter of 2010 reflected a refinement in the calculation.
So we would expect these metrics to pick up somewhat over time as we continue to grow our business.
Moving to Slide 15 Lending Net Write-off Rate.
So here both the U.S.
and the international write-off rate continue to improve.
And as you know our write-off rates started to improve before the industry.
And as we said we moved sooner in terms of credit actions.
Our actions have been very effective and we have a higher quality base.
So our write off rate is now at 3.7% the lowest in the industry.
So the write-offs in the first quarter were $541 million which is about $500 million lower than what they were in 2010.
So moving to Slide 16 this is Lending 30-day Past Due and you can see that we continue to have improvement in both the U.S.
and it has stabilized in International.
These are at historical lows.
So I'd point out that our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate for 30-day past due levels but to make good economic decisions to drive profitable growth.
So Slide 17 is a slide we've looked at in terms of helping us think where we're going going forward.
Here I'd start on the right-hand side.
So you can see that the number of bankruptcies are down notably in the first quarter for us.
And this is consistent with the trend seen in the industry.
Regarding bankruptcies I'd also point out that the average dollar amount of each bankruptcy has been decreasing and approximately 2/3 of all bankruptcies reported to us we've already written the account off.
So now looking at the chart on the upper left and we've used this in the past year or so to be helpful.
So here if you look on the upper left chart and look at the green triangles so these are the balances that rolled from current to past due in August through September of 2010.
And they were write off 5 months later if they remain delinquent until they wrote off in the first quarter of 2011.
Next to that -- next to these the green triangles if you look at the next 3 blue triangles they are lower than the green triangles.
So if the 30-day past due write-off to write-off which is on the bottom chart remains constant an early write-off to recoveries are unchanged the second quarter 2011 write-offs would be lower than the write-offs we had in the first quarter of 2011.
The other item that I'd point out on this chart are the next 2 blue triangles which are the last 2 blue triangles are flat with the prior triangle.
Flowing at the bottom chart the 30-Day Past Due to Write-off rate so through March this past due write-off rate remains pretty consistent with the recent prior periods.
Let me go now to Slide 18.
So this is a new chart it's Worldwide Lending Reserve Releases and if you look across the top you'll see the amount of reserve releases the dollar amount of reserve releases each quarter.
And this indicates that in the first quarter of 2011 we released $700 million.
Now if we look at the bars the light blue bars are the dollar amounts of write-offs in their respective quarters.
The dark blue bars are provision.
So it's write-offs less reserve releases give you provision.
So it's important to realize that the improvement in provision has built in the combination of lower write-offs and the reserve releases.
So if you use the first quarter of 2010 as an example you can see that the write-offs were about $1.2 billion reserve releases were $500 million.
And so the provision was about $700 million.
And that ties back to Slide #9.
If we look at the first quarter of 2011 we actually have a credit in lending provision and that's because the reserve release of $700 million is larger than the write-offs in the quarter which were approximately $600 million.
We would expect the write-off rate to remain below historical levels in the near future.
Although I would note that if you went back to the first quarter of 2010 our reserves for loan excluded $5.3 billion.
And at the end of the first quarter of 2011 it's $2.9 billion.
So going forward we would expect reserve releases to diminish.
If you go to Slide 19 these are lending reserve ratios coverage ratios.
And as credit metrics have improved our lending reserve coverage has started to come down and you can see that in U.S.
Card as well as Worldwide.
Reserves as a percentage of past due and principal month coverage have also ticked down.
And although we had reserve releases of $700 million in the quarter our reserve coverage remains at appropriate levels.
Next is Slide 20 Capital Ratios.
You can see our Tier 1 common is 11.8% compared to 11.1% in the fourth quarter.
So this increase is primarily driven by lower risk weighted assets.
So it reflects the seasonal change in loan balances which have declined as well as there were certain cash that was considered restricted cash in the fourth quarter but is now free cash.
Those are the 2 main drivers.
These ratios continue to be strong.
Now I would point out that we do not plan to maintain the Tier 1 common ratio above 11%.
Our target is to have it between 10% and 11%.
I'd now hear that we plan to restart our share repurchase in the second quarter.
Now if the Basel III guidelines were implemented in the first quarter of 2011 we would estimate that it would reduce our ratio by about 80 basis points.
And that compares to an estimate we had in the fourth quarter of about 50 basis points.
And that shows really or finally in the calculation that we made as we continue to gain a broader understanding and quite frankly some of the factors quarter to quarter will change.
So moving to Slide 21 our liquidity snapshot we continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities which is our stated objective then we're somewhere above that in the first quarter and that's because Personal Savings our direct deposit program actually was somewhat stronger than we expected.
Now we can see that on the next slide Slide 22 so this is a summary of our U.S.
Retail Deposit Program.
And you can see that the direct deposits increased by $3.4 billion in the first quarter.
And you also see that third-party CDs declined by $1.9 billion.
And on those CDs the weighted average remaining maturity is about 19.5 months.
Now we don't expect direct deposit growth to continue at this level over the balance of the year.
In fact what happened is we kind of got stuck in the 1 or 2 position on the rate tables which is not where we want.
However we have sent out marketing materials and when others dropped their rates we didn't want to drop our rates right on the heels of sending out marketing materials.
We have moved our rate down on the highs from 1.3% to 1.5%.
And if needed we will continue to move that rate so that we are not in the first or second position.
Deposits now total $31 billion.
So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.
Results for the quarter reflect a continuation of the positive business trends evident during last year.
Spending growth remains strong across all business segments and geographic regions despite increasingly difficult prior-year comparisons.
We also saw further improvement in lending credit trends some of it is due to our strategic and risk-related actions and some reflecting the post-recession behavior of customers.
But the versions between consumer spending and borrowing levels continues to illustrate this change in behavior as well as our shift in focus to a more premium lending customer.
The net effect of all these factors is an improvement in the risk profile of the overall company.
Revenue growth which continued to improve in the quarter but still is below our long-term target continue to outpace our large issuer competitors as strong cardmember spending volumes more than offset the impact of lower loan use.
As expected our strong billings growth and improved credit trends once again provide the opportunity to invest in the business at high levels while also generating strong earnings.
These investments continue to be focused on driving current metrics and building capabilities that will benefit the medium to long-term success of the company.
1 example of a longer-term initiative was the recent launch of Serve our next-generation digital payment platform.
While many investments are reflected in marketing and operating expense others involve using our strong capital base such as our recent Loyalty Partner acquisition and the Payfone equity investment announced last week.
Despite strong momentum across our business the economic and regulatory environment remains uncertain.
In addition as you know later this year we will stop receiving the quarterly Visa and MasterCard litigation payments.
And year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult in light of the strong 2010 credit and volume trends.
In light of these factors we are moving forward with plans to slow the growth of our operating expenses toward the end of this year and into 2012.
The bottom line is our strong competitive position and unique business model are yielding high-quality results.
As spending on our network continues to be well above industry average and our credit performance remains the best among the major card issuers.
We are confident that our investments and business model are appropriately positioned to manage through the changing environment capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace.
Thanks for listening and I'm now ready to take questions.
[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from the line of Craig Mauer with CLSA.
First let me congratulate Ron on completing his final earnings release.
Thank you Craig.
Moving onto the hot topic which is expenses a couple of questions there.
If we were to add in the $220 million contra expense item regarding the settlement payments to the other expense line will this quarter represent a good run rate for that line as it seems this is about where you were running prerecession on average on a quarterly basis? And also if you can just help us with a little flavor in terms of going into next year you talk about moving the expenses as a percentage of managed revenue ratio back down toward prerecession levels I mean what type of move can we think about for next year with the understanding that this is a multiyear effort? Okay so I think that some of the elevation in operating expense is going to continue.
So to the extent we have investment in sales force that will continue at that level and we think it will generate revenues that make it a worthwhile investment.
Our investments to build teams that enable projects like Business Insights or enterprise growth again those are expenses that will continue going forward and will be supported by the revenues that they would generate.
Now there are some investments that we elevated particularly in the technologies area which are projects that have a very finite life to them.
And we wouldn't necessarily see those at the levels that we've seen over the last several quarters.
So I think we will calibrate our expenses and be mindful that when some of the resources we currently have such as the release of credit reserves and when the payments of Visa/MasterCard come to an end that we have expense levels that are appropriate for our revenues and as I said we would expect expense growth later in the year to scale down and slow.
So it's kind of a combination.
Some will continue but others will decrease as we move forward.
So specifically in the Other Revenue line were we at a good run rate there concerning the settlement payments of contra expense and I guess in a slightly different fashion if we think about the reserve release slowing that you talked about and the reduction in spending that would be commensurate with that is that I mean should we look for reduction in HR? I mean where are we looking for that reduction is what I'm trying to get at.
I guess I would look at operating expenses kind of line items together.
So I'll look at expenses exclude provisions obviously exclude marketing exclude rewards.
If we exclude those those are the operating expenses that I'm addressing.
And I'm not specifically saying that you're going to see a decrease in that line item.
I think there will be a decrease in certain elements of that line item.
What I'm saying is you're not going to see the growth rates on that line that you've been seeing over the last several quarters.
But not necessarily a decrease.
A decrease in certain items but not necessarily a decrease when you look at operating expenses in total.
If that were the case as we move through the year the growth rates will decline.
Okay thanks Dan.
Next we'll hear from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
When we look at the rewards expense it's basically a function -- the growth rate is a function of 3 things: It's the Billed business growth whatever you do whatever incentives you're providing or programs you're running during the quarter and then in this quarter getting change in assumption on the long-term redemption rate.
Going forward the way I'm thinking that we should model this and correct me if I'm wrong here is that we should see a really at least on the margin is a function as the growth in the Billed business that the change in assumption this quarter the incremental somewhere between $165 million and $185 million was a one-time event? Generally you would expect rewards to grow in line with Billed business unless we are increasing certain programs.
Now so I think it's reasonable to expect rewards to grow with business okay? However what I would say is that we continue to refine our estimation process around the ultimate redemption rate.
And to the extent either cardmember behavior changes or we evolve the program in such a way that we're increasing redemptions in those cases we would expect to see increases in expense when we identify those.
So I think on an ongoing basis we're always looking at our estimation process and continue to refine it as appropriate.
I would point out that this line is both a combination of Membership Rewards as well as our co-brand products.
The other element that you didn't mention when you think about expense in the quarter is volume related to Membership Rewards.
It's volume it's the ultimate redemption rate and it's the cost per point.
And cost per point during some periods will increase depending on the mix of redemption by customers.
And in some point it could decrease again based on their behaviors or new redemption options that we put into the program.
So that's the other factor that you need to keep in mind.
If I could have just 1 quick follow-up.
Is the test for the redemption rate a quarterly test or is that something you review annually? It's a quarterly test.
Great.
Thank you Dan.
Next we'll hear from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Just wanted to shift to the capital ratio comment that you had.
You indicated a comment Tier 1 10% to 11% was really more in line with where you'd like it to be for your long-term goal.
Are you anticipating any type of timeframe to get there? Is that something that you're targeting by year end? So I would say our target of 10% to 11% is where we are absent further guidance from the regulators.
When they finally come out with their rules depending on where it is we may modify that.
But in the moderate term I would say it's 10% to 11%.
This ratio will obviously move based on the matter of share buybacks we do.
We could have periods where a certain amount of cash we're required to take certain cash prior to the redemption of certain securitization and put it into restricted cash.
The extent that happens those type of things could impact the ratio in the short-term.
If you think about share buyback you should really think about the guidance we've given that we basically want to return about 50% of our earnings to shareholders either through dividends or share buybacks plus we would have buybacks equal to the amount of capital that's raised through employee plans.
But you indicated too that the ratio could be declined by about 80 basis points or so from your current 11.8%.
Did I hear you right? Someone made the predictions that we're going to drop about 80 basis points next quarter.
I'm just saying our moderate term target is between 10% and 11% right.
But that moment we happen to be at 11.8% next quarter we're going to have -- moving our balance sheet we're going to have our share repurchases and we're going to have earnings.
Whatever the composite of that is is where we'll wind up.
This could be above 11% or it might be in the 10% to 11% range.
And you indicated your buybacks to start next quarter through this quarter so you're not waiting for anything from the Citi buffer.
You also at one point indicated that you didn't think you were systemic risk bank does that assessment still hold? So we have heard back from the Fed which had no objection to our plan that we submitted.
We are certainly one of the 19 large banks in the U.S.
although to the extent there are global significant banks we don't believe we are 1 of those banks.
Okay got it.
Thanks.
Next we'll hear from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</strong> I had a question on the ultimate redemption rate change again.
I'm just trying to understand how much of that change was a conscious decision for greater engagement versus some kind of structural change in the competitive environment.
Could you just help us think about that because all if equal it would seem like you'd have less discretion to spend money elsewhere.
And obviously you're looking to take expenses down.
So maybe you could just talk about that and then just how does the current redemption rate assumption track what your assumption is? So I don't think there is any structural change in the competitive environment.
I think we have continued to look to enhance the value proposition of Membership Rewards to the extent we're successful in doing that.
We're going to have greater cardmember engagement to the extent we have greater cardmember engagement we're going to have higher redemption levels.
So I think as you think about how we deploy our resources we do make conscious decisions about the amount we're going to allocate to rewards versus marketing how much we're going to have in loyalty programs or acquisition of customers.
So all of those things are similar levers and we make conscious decisions about in terms of how we're going allocate our resources at the end of the day.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</strong> And then just on the redemption rate tracking currently tracking to your expectation? So the ultimate redemption rate is going to be based on cardmember behavior and we do a quarterly calculation where we're endeavoring to estimate what we think the ultimate redemption rate is going to be.
If cardmember behavior changes the estimate will change.
And at times we do refinements of the estimation process and that will result in potential changes as well.
So it's a combination of all of those things that impacted the rate in this quarter and will impact the rate of the quarter going forward.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</strong> Okay thank you.
Next we'll hear from the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.
Inc.</strong> Dan I hate to go back to cardmember rewards but was there a step-up function this quarter like one time in nature such that you have like a build of the reserves such a that it would start correlating a lot more of spending more towards the point made earlier? Or should we start thinking about this at a similar level relative to growth and discount revenue? Okay so what the expense is in each quarter is a function of spend ultimate redemption rate estimate and the weighted average cost per point.
Those are the elements that drive expense each quarter okay.
The weighted average cost per point we actually use the weighted average of the last 12 months as the best estimate for that okay.
Spend is going to be whatever our cardmember spend in a quarter.
If the average weighted cost per point and the URR does not change for the quarter then rewards should grow equal to the growth in Billed business okay.
In this quarter we refined our methodology and it resulted in a increase based on the behaviors of our customers in the ultimate redemption rate estimate from 91% up to 92% for our active participants okay.
So each quarter it will be the same process that I just described.
Inc.</strong> One other final thing as you talked about expenses and potentially the growth rate of expenses changing but you also referenced expenses relative to operating margins.
Sort of commensurate with the revenue growth that you're anticipating from the investment spending.
And in some of your prior presentations you alluded to getting back to kind of pre-recession operating margins or certainly things that we've been talking about.
Is that still a stated goal and what is kind of the timeframe for us to be thinking about that stated goal that we had in the past? So I think on average and overtime perspective I think we want to be at historical margins.
It's not a state objective but I think that's basically where we want to get back to.
Now the actual mix of expenses within those margins could change.
We could decide to increase the amount that we allocate to or that we target for marketing promotion or we could target to take that down.
We could decide that from an overall perspective the best thing to do is to increase the value proposition in our rewards programs.
And then that would become a larger perspective -- a larger percentage rather.
So I think we're constantly looking at that and calibrating it to achieve the right returns on our investments and the right financial performance on average and over time in line with our stated objective of 8% plus revenue growth 12% to 15% EPS growth and ROE of 25% plus.
So those are all things that we use to calibrate the decisions that we make.
Inc.</strong> Thank you.
Next we'll hear from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.
Do you have a target for when operating leverage will turn positive? So just if you can tell me exactly what that calculation is? So revenue growth exceeding expense growth on a year-over-year basis.
I'm just trying to piece together we've got operating expense slowing we've got marketing budget which I guess is fairly discretionary we've got presumably the rewards expense growing in line with discount revenues.
But just when will that revenue growth line start exceeding the expense growth line? Is that also something that we could expect to happen at the end of this year and into next or will that be different because of the trajectory of rewards and marketing? So I wouldn't do a forecast of revenue growth or expense growth going forward although I would go back and say that the targets that I just alluded to in terms of EPS growth which are on average and overtime I think we've said that 2010 is a good base to think about in terms of achieving those targets on average amount of time going forward.
So that would give you an idea of what our expectation is both for revenues as well as for EPS growth.
And then just a cleanup question on tax rate is the tax rate we saw this quarter what we should expect over time or what should we use as a long-term tax rate.
I think our rate was 31%-ish 32%? Okay so I think we've said on average over time again we would expect the tax rate in the 30% to 32% range.
In particular quarters there may be discreet tax items that would cause it to either be lower or higher but that's about the right range we should expect 30% or 32%.
Thanks.
Next we'll hear from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
I'd like to second the congratulations for Ron.
I appreciate your help over the many years.
Thank you very much.
The first question I have is you're obviously seeing the lending side of the equation stabilize much earlier than others.
And I'm interested if you could give us any context as to what is supporting the balances stabilizing at these levels.
Is it new card acquisitions that are coming in with balances is it purely just more spending.
Could you give us any context for what's driving that superior performance relative to the industry please? Okay so we are focused from a card acquisition perspective on charge cards and premium lending.
So I think the nature of the customers we're acquiring is reflective of that strategy.
And so they tend to be customers that may be more transactors in nature may revolve to a lesser degree than customers did historically.
I think you're seeing that in the pay down rates that I alluded to before.
In March of this year we're up about 30% compared to paydown rate of 27% in March of 2010.
So I think we're having high quality acquisitions.
Those customers are spending you can see that.
And the whole I think our customer base as well as others are tending to de-lever.
And I think all of those things are coming into play.
As you said our customers when recession was at its height at the beginning of 2009 pulled back sooner even though they had the capacity to spend and pay they were cautious.
Now those customers have come back very strongly.
We saw our improvements in spending by our customers really move to very strong levels in the first quarter of '09.
That's continued.
And I think it's really the nature of our customer base the quality of our customer base that it's causing us to move in advance of the rest of the industry on spending on credit behavior as well as from loan balances.
Now the other thing you have to remember too is we've changed strategy we're not looking to balance transfers as a way of bringing customers on board we're not using fees or rates.
That's another thing that's coming into play.
So I think what you're seeing on the loan side is very much a function of our strategy.
Now how customer behavior will change over the next 24 months we will have to wait and see.
But I think all those things come into play in terms of what we're seeing in the loan balances.
And as a follow-up I don't want to beat the expense horse to death it's pretty obvious that got a lot of flexibility in terms of how you manage expenses over time.
What is a little less predictable or a little less manageable is really on the revenue side.
And I'm wondering if you could give us any perspective on how you are looking at the investments that you have made if you're feeling that the returns in terms of the revenue opportunity is coming in either in-line or better or worse than in-budgeted.
Or how are you thinking about these investments if you can give us any context around when we would see the revenue side? So I think you are already seeing the revenue side.
I think we're very pleased.
We have over the last 5 quarters said we want to invest in part to drive near-term metrics.
And in part to build capabilities that will enable the success of the company over the moderate to long-term.
So when you look at our Billed business growth of 17% I think that's a very clear reflection that the investments that we're making in cardmember acquisition and in our loyalty and rewards program are paying off.
And those growth rates are not only terrific on a absolute basis they're notably better than the rest of the industry.
So I think that's very positive.
I think the investments that we're making in terms of fee businesses businesses that will generate fee revenues I think we're making good progress there.
We're pleased with the results to date.
Investments in the digital space Serve is a very good example.
And we bought Revolution Money in January of 2010.
We invested in building the capabilities over the next 15 months.
We launched Serve in March of this year.
We'll continue to build out the capabilities of Serve.
So I think there are very tangible indications that our investments are paying off.
Now revenue growth is 7% again.
It's really the best in the industry.
Now it is being impacted by the fact that loans are flat but they stabilize.
So that's good.
Our yields is at 9.1%.
It's down to 10% last year but we knew that.
We expect that as the Card Act came in that's exactly what would happen.
Notwithstanding that it's putting a drag on revenue growth.
So we're cognizant of that but there are a lot of very positive signs related to both the strategy that we put in place the investments we've made the execution on those investments and then the resulting positive output.
Thank you.
Next we'll hear from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.
LLLP</strong> I wanted to ask two separate questions.
As a follow-up to Dan you're just prior comment about the fee-based business making good progress.
I think you said in the public forum that you were targeting generating I can’t remember if it was $3 billion or $4 billion in revenue from those initiatives.
Are you still comfortable with those targets? That's the first question.
And then separately I was wondering if you might be able to provide us an update on the DOJ litigation.
Okay.
So our target for $3 billion in fee revenues has not changed.
And as I said I think we're making good progress on that front.
So there's no change there.
As it relates to your second question the main development on the DOJ front is that there was a hearing on March 2 and we had a schedule of discovery in terms of document discovery expert discovery filing of briefs and arguments.
And the final pretrial conference is scheduled to be held in February of 2013.
Now obviously any of the parties could ask for an extension if they had good reason for that.
But that's the update in terms of the schedule related to DOJ.
I guess I'd also point out that despite that DOJ suit being out there our relationships with merchants continue to operate in a very business-as-usual form.
We continue to renew contracts you can see by the discount rate that it continues to hold at 2.55%.
So we view those all as a very positive aspects as we think about really the strength of our network which is helping to enable the spend of our customers.
LLLP</strong> Thank you.
Next we'll hear from the line of Mike Taiano with Sandler O'Neill.
Dan I just have a question on how we should think about revenue growth.
So 7% year-on-year you're pretty close to I think with your long-term target of 8% is.
How should we think of it in terms of relative to Billed business? Because the gap is pretty wide.
Should we expect that gap to narrow over time for Billed business to remain slightly higher than your revenue you grow over time? And then also if you could just remind us with respect to the overall economy if you think that you can achieve sort of your long-term targets under current conditions or if you really need a pickup in GDP.
Yes I guess what I would say is that if GDP is around 3% I think in normal conditions that we would be able to achieve our revenue target on average in over time.
In this current environment because we're coming out of a recession and the fact that we have a decrease in yield that's a drag on the percentage on an aggregate basis.
And I would look to fee businesses to help to contribute to the growth in revenues as those investments start to kick in.
As you know anytime we -- as I know any time we make kind of BAU kind of investments in card acquisition we have a very good ability to estimate what we're going to achieve.
Anytime we do something new which is some of what we're doing in the fee revenue space and with Serve there's a higher degree of execution risk.
But we have as I said before we're making good progress in this area and I think fee revenues over time will be a contributor that enable us to achieve the revenue growth in excess of 8%.
And if you look back over the last 10 years we've been very successful with our investments.
So we have taken share every year since 2002 through 2008.
There's a slight dip in 2009 but we have very good share gains in 2010.
So that's really another thing that's been contributing to our ability to outperform the marketplace.
So again we achieved 7% revenue growth in the quarter with 0 growth in loans and a declining yield.
So I think our ability to achieve 8 plus percent in revenue growth assuming a reasonable economy which I described as GDP of 3% is very achievable.
One last point of clarification on the capital ratios when you say 10% to 11% Tier 1 comment are you talking in terms of Basel III? So I've been talking really in terms of our current calculation.
But even if we went to Basel III it was 80 basis points lower.
Based on our current numbers we would be within that range.
By the time Basel III actually comes into effect hopefully we'll actually have specific guidance in terms of where the Fed would expect us to be.
So we'll refine that more as we get the final rules and we get closer to the Basel III implementation.
But certainly we have terrific earnings power to create free cash flow.
This quarter we had $1 177 000 000 in earnings.
Our dividend is only about $200 million.
So we'll be showing off almost $1 billion in capital in the quarter.
So if we needed to increase that percentage in a given period we have a lot of wherewithal to do that.
Thanks.
Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Macquarie.
Dan you had previously mentioned apart from the $3 billion target in for fee-based revenues by the end of 2014 you previously indicated that in 2009 you generated about $800 million in fee-based revenues.
So that suggests that you're expecting roughly a 30% compound annual growth rate over that period.
Can you tell us what the 2010 fee-based revenues were? It's that number that we've disclosed.
We will give I think some disclosures on this as we go forward.
I don't think this is a straight line from $800 million to $3 billion right? I think it requires heavy investment which we're doing right now in the first part of that period and then we'll get escalating results as we move through the period.
So I don’t have a specific disclosure on that but I would say we're making good progress.
Okay so there's no number that you can share for 2010? Not at this time.
Okay.
And then just for a perspective so we kind of understand as we're moving forward can we expect at some point to get kind of more granular insight into how each of the various fee businesses are doing as they kind of contribute to that overall target? So I think it would be fair as we move over the course of 2012 to '14 to figure out what the right disclosures are as an indication that we're actually making progress against our targets of 2014.
And finally if I could have just 1 last follow-up.
There have been some concerns that some investors have expressed about your ability to continue to be able to command premium pricing on Amex spending in light of the relatively lower economics that the Serve product will generate.
Can you just talk to that point and just discuss how you intend to handle any potential merchant pushback and different pricing for these different products particularly at the time of contract the renegotiation? Well I think these are two separate products right? I mean as you think about it our current products our charge cards and lending products and we have a certain set of economics attached to those.
I think maybe that the customers that the Serve product will attract are people who today use cash or debit or prepaid.
And those transactions will attract the different discount rate.
But those are very different products meeting different customer needs.
And I think merchants will view them as different in nature.
So I think they both will operate they both will meet the needs of customers in the marketplace but they're different customers.
That's not to say that some of our current cardmembers may not decide to open up a Serve account but I think they'll use them in different ways.
So we'll see how the economic model evolves within Serve but we don't think that it will create any additional pressure with merchants.
I think with merchants for our charge and credit products we negotiate with them all the time when contracts are renewed and we agree on pricing based on the value that we bring to them over our network.
Thanks.
Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.
Just to clarify I guess on the revenue side I guess on the loan growth you're 25% of revenue net interest income.
This quarter is down 9% year-over-year.
The margin really fell off in the second quarter.
So I mean the comparison you established slight bit of a low growth in 2Q '11 possibly or flat or slight loan growth but you'll have pretty flat margins.
So that by itself probably gets you over the 8% revenue growth target? Well I'm not going to forecast what's going to happen in the second quarter but certainly to the extent the yields year-over-year start to equalize which is going to happen in the very near future that will be a factor that will be less of a drag on revenue growth that was last year or in this quarter.
So I think that's a fair observation.
And elected Loyalty Partners what is the revenue of Loyalty Partner's into the one-month you had and what is the annual run rate throughout the...
So I think what we said is that last year it was about $300 million.
So you kind of use that as a guidepost in terms of what revenues in this quarter were.
Just 1 big expense item and I....
1 month with Loyalty Partner in this quarter.
And just 1 expense item I know this is built into your 12% to 15% and you have flexibility.
But the comp expense is up 15% year-over-year employees up 6% and some incentives I mean were there some unusual -- I mean we shouldn't expect comp expense to grow at a level that would be much above the employee growth rate should we? Well I think in the normal course you would have employee growth and you'd have year increases.
I think that's what you think about as normal growth.
In this particular quarter the instance of compensation accruals we're making in this quarter are higher than the ones we made in the first quarter of last year and there were just some other employee-related benefit items that grew at a slightly higher rate.
Okay thank you.
And it comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup.
Dan I was just wondering if you have a better sense of what the impact of CFDA might be on your business.
And also if you hearing anything on the merchant settlement it might indicate that they're moving towards credit interchange reduction? Well first in terms of the CFDA we have to wait and see.
There's been a lot of discussion about exactly what they'll do until they're actually up and operational which I think happens in the summer and they actually name the person who will leave that organization we would know that.
While we are certainly staying in close contact to the discussions in that area.
So that's something that we'll have to just wait and see.
Now as it relates to the merchant settlement I guess not sure exactly which merchant settlement you refer to.
So if you're referring to the Visa and MasterCard? There's been some concern that as part of outside of a monetary settlement there may be a business practice change with respect to credit interchange.
I was wondering if you've gotten any indications that it might be moving in that direction or give any concerns around that.
So I would say we don't really have any insights in terms of the Visa and MasterCard talks that they're having.
So I can't shed any light on that.
Sure thank you.
Okay so just before we end as a couple of people have mentioned Ron Stovall is retiring in 16 days.
If you're sitting here you could see him smile.
So Ron has extraordinary knowledge has been a terrific advocate for the company but in a very balanced way I think we're very happy about that.
So I want to thank him for his significant contributions that he made.
And I think you the investment community will actually be in good hands going forward as Rick Petrino is taking leadership of the Investor Relations group and Toby Willard who has been a key part of that team and doing a traffic job will continue.
So I congratulate Ron but I have full faith in our team that we'll continue to be able to be responsive to your questions and your needs.
So thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by.
Welcome to the American Express Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you Rocco.
Welcome.
We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion.
Before we start the slide presentation it is my role to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the second quarter 2011 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dan completes his remarks he will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&amp;A period.
Up until then no one has actually registered to ask questions.
While we attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call we do have a limited amount of time.
Based on this we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&amp;A.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay.
Thanks Rick.
So I will go through the slide presentation and we'll start with Slide 2 which is the Summary of Financial Performance.
So total revenues net of interest expense was $7.6 billion.
That's a 12% increase over last year.
On an FX-adjusted basis it is 8%.
So even after adjusting for the foreign exchange impact we achieved our long-term revenue growth target of 8%.
Income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion 27% higher than last year.
EPS from continuing operations was $1.07.
We also had $0.03 of earnings from discontinued operations which was really a tax settlement related to American Express Bank.
So EPS on net income is $1.10 but we'll focus on the $1.07.
Return on average equity was 28% and shares outstanding were even with last year.
So moving to Metric Performance on Slide 3 Billed business in the quarter was $207 billion 18% higher than last year 15% on an FX-adjusted basis.
So the second quarter was the strongest quarter for Billed business in American Express history both on a reported basis and an FX-adjusted basis.
So record spending by our Cardmembers.
On an FX basis Billings growth has either been 14% or 15% over the last 5 quarters and 15% in this quarter.
Cards-in-force grew 6%.
GNS cards grew at 15% and proprietary cards at 2%.
Average basic Cardmember spending increased 15% and 11% on an FX-adjusted basis obviously a major driver for the increase in Billed business.
Loans grew 2% and it's been many quarters since we've had growth in loans.
Not on this chart are accounts receivable related to Charge Card and there we actually had a sequential growth of 6%.
So looking at worldwide travel sales it grew 17% 10% on an FX-adjusted basis.
It was primarily driven by higher air sales where we had both an increase in transactions and higher ticket price although the increase in transactions was the larger contributor and we had growth in both corporate and consumer travel.
Moving to Slide 4.
This is Billed business growth by segment.
So we continued to see broad-based growth across all the segments.
On an FX-adjusted basis all 6 segments had double-digit growth.
GNS has the highest growth at 25% on an FX-adjusted basis and over the past 7 quarters has had growth over 20%.
The other segments have also had consistent growth over the last 5 quarters.
If we move to Slide 5 which is Billed business growth by Region.
Again here we continue to see broad-based growth across all regions.
On an FX-adjusted basis all regions had double-digit growth.
In the past 6 quarters all regions have had double-digit growth.
So again here in each region the growth has been pretty consistent over the last several quarters.
Moving to Slide 6 so this is looking at lending Billed business versus managed loan growth.
So the solid line is growth in spending on lending products and the dotted line is growth in loans.
And you can see on the chart that the growth in spending on lending products has not correlated with the change in loan balances over the past 2 years.
Again not on this chart but if you were to look at Charge Card billings compared to accounts receivable growth that actually does move in tandem.
So the difference in growth between spending on lending products and loans is in part due to our actions and part due to Cardmember behavior.
So our actions are that we have reduced the amount of proprietary lending acquisitions and those acquisitions are focused on premium lending.
And they tend to revolve less.
We've also had a significant reduction in balance transfers.
On the Cardmember side they are simply deleveraging.
So the transactors have become a larger percentage of our loan book.
If you were to look at the lending trust payment rate you would see that in June of 2010 the rate was 28.9% and in June of 2011 it's 31.6%.
So 270 basis points higher.
If we move to Slide 7 this is the U.S.
consumer net interest yield for managed Cardmember loans.
So while this time period is no longer on the chart if you went back prior to 2009 net interest yield was generally in the high 8% to 9% range.
So rates increased in 2009 in anticipation of the CARD Act.
Rates have now come down in recent quarters as anticipated.
As discussed in prior quarters the impact of the CARD Act within yield is significant.
However we have worked to mitigate it through our repricing activities.
So the lower yield reflects lower revolve rates and lower balances at penalty rates offset by certain repricing initiatives.
Going forward yield will continue to be influenced by a number of factors including our strategy to focus on premium lending the credit quality of our portfolio the percentage of the portfolio that is revolving and the cost of funds.
If we move to Slide 8 so this is revenue performance you can see overall revenues grew at 12%.
Discount revenue grew at 16% driven by 18% growth in Billed business.
It also reflects a slight decline in our average discount rate the fact that GNS Billed business is growing faster than the average and we have higher contra revenue items such as corporate incentives and partner payments.
Card fees are up 5%.
This reflects the growth of 2% in proprietary cards and the balance of the growth is the result of foreign exchange and the weaker dollar.
Travel is up 21% on 17% increase in sales and a slightly higher commission rate.
Other commissions and fees is primarily driven by loyalty partners being included in this quarter when it was not in last quarter or the quarter last year.
Other revenues reflect higher GNS partner royalties higher foreign exchange fees higher prepaid revenues greater merchant-related fee revenues and they all contributed to the 10% growth in this line.
Net interest income is down 3% and this reflects the lower yield I just discussed offset by the 2% increase in average Cardmember loans.
So overall we have 12% reported growth in revenues 8% on an FX-adjusted basis very strong relative performance.
Next to Slide 9 provision for losses and this continues to be well below historic levels and enables us to invest to drive future business momentum.
The Charge Card provision is $65 million higher than last year.
Write-off rates are about the same in both periods and therefore the write-off dollars are about the same.
But in 2010 it included a $60 million reserve release reflecting the improvement in credit metrics compared to prior periods.
Credit performance in Charge Card continues to be excellent.
Now lending provision as you can see as you'll see on the later slide the write-off rate is down dramatically compared to 2010.
Reserve releases in both periods are similar.
So the reserve releases in 2010 and '11 are similar.
But we have a lower provision driven by the lower write-off dollars which are a result of the lower write-off rates.
Slide 10 so this is Charge Card credit performance.
So Charge Card credit performance continues to be excellent and stable and at historic low levels both in the U.S.
Consumer business International Consumer and the Global Commercial Card business.
Since our objective is to grow the business profitably and not have the lowest possible write-off rate I would expect these metrics to pick up over time as we grow the business.
Slide 11 lending net write-off rate.
So the U.S.
and International write-off rates continue to improve.
The worldwide rate is now 3.1% compared to 6% last year.
The U.S.
lending credit performance is the best in the industry.
The U.S.
Consumer write-off rate in this quarter was 3.2% and in June was 2.7%.
Moving to Slide 12 so this is the lending 30-day past due.
So the 30-day past due has improved in both the U.S.
and internationally.
Again this is best-in-industry performance.
Again our objective is not to have the lowest possible credit metrics but to make good economic decisions that drive profitable growth.
So here we move to Slide 13 so this is USCS managed lending roll rates and bankruptcy filings.
If we look at the right side of this chart it's the number of bankruptcies and you can see that it's up slightly from the first quarter but well below the levels that we saw in 2009 and 2010.
And I'd remind you that about 2/3 of the bankruptcies have already been written off by the time we receive the notice.
Now the left side of the chart is designed to be helpful as we look forward.
So if you look at the upper left chart so these are balances that roll from current to 30 days past due and if you look at the green triangles those are the balances that went past due in November December and January and they write off 5 months later if they continue to be delinquent.
So those green triangles wrote off in the second quarter of 2011.
Then you can see that the 3 blue triangles are lower.
The next 3 blue triangles are lower than the green triangles.
So if the 30-day past-due amounts to write off which is the chart on the bottom left remain constant the third quarter 2011 write-off would be lower than what we saw in the second quarter of 2011.
It also assumes that early write-offs or recoveries remain unchanged.
Although I would note that the 30-day past due to write-off rate the bottom-left chart has ticked down slightly.
If we go to Slide 14 so this is the worldwide lending reserve releases.
This chart shows the lending reserve releases across the top by quarter.
The light-blue bar are the write-off dollars in the quarter and the dark-blue bars is the provision.
So it's the dollar write-offs less the reserve releases.
So in the second quarter of 2011 the reserve release was approximately the same as the second quarter in 2010.
But we had a lower write-off rate in 2011 and therefore the write-off dollars are lower in 2011 and therefore the provision is lower in 2011 compared to 2010.
The reserve release in the second quarter of '11 is lower than the past several quarters.
So while credit is improving it is at a slower rate than we saw in recent quarters.
Reserve releases should diminish as we go forward.
Looking at Slide 15 so this is Lending Reserve Coverage.
So as credit metrics continue to improve the reserve as a percentage of loan continues to come down in the U.S.
and worldwide.
In the U.S.
it now stands at 4.5% and worldwide it is at 4.4%.
Reserves as a percentage of past due and principal months coverage have remained similar to the levels that we had in the first quarter.
Although we released reserves of $400 million in the quarter coverage ratios remain at appropriate levels.
So if we look at Slide 16 expense performance.
So expenses increased 21% on a reported basis but 17% on an FX-adjusted basis.
Marketing and promotion decreased by 4% due to lower USCS product media spend partially offset by higher investments in international markets and I'll provide some additional detail on following slides.
Cardmember rewards increased 35% year-over-year.
So this is greater reward-related spending volumes and higher co-brand expense.
In addition we see higher membership rewards redemption rates that have led by a -- that led to an increase in the ultimate redemption rate.
We also saw a shift in redemption mix which is increasing our weighted average cost per point.
And I have a slide to talk to this in more detail in a minute.
Salaries and employee benefits increased 21% and this reflects higher employee levels merit increases for existing employees higher benefit-related costs and $48 million of severance costs related to reengineering and higher incentive-related compensation.
Total expense adjusted for FX and if we were to exclude the reengineering cost would be 15%.
Professional services increased 17% reflecting higher technology development including various initiatives related to digitizing the business globalizing operating platforms and enhancing analytic and data capabilities.
It also includes higher legal cost greater third-party merchant service sales force commissions.
And it also includes a reduction of the amount previously capitalized related to software development by third-party vendors and that amount was $38 million.
And lastly we have a lower tax rate that reflects the favorable resolution of certain prior-year tax items.
We utilized this tax benefit to invest at higher levels.
Moving to Slide 17.
As we discussed in prior quarters the high level of spending reflects the benefits from improving credit and the Visa-MasterCard payments.
As these benefits lessen over time we have the flexibility to move investment spending towards historic levels.
So if you looked at M&amp;P as a percentage of revenues it was 7% in 2007.
During the crisis of 2009 it dropped to 7%.
And in the second quarter of 2011 it stands at 10%.
So when I reference moving to historical levels I mean about 7% or -- sorry 9% of revenues or about $700 million per quarter.
Spending on marketing and promotions in the second quarter was $795 million.
Within USCS we focused on Platinum and Charge Cards Blue Sky Blue Cash and Delta acquisitions although we had lower product media spend.
In International Consumer we focused on acquisitions in our major proprietary markets and marketing related to loyalty partners.
In GNMS we focused on merchant spend simulation perceptions of coverage and certain contractual and incentive payments.
So now let's move to Slide 18 Cardmember rewards expense.
Cardmember rewards expense increased $1.6 billion -- or was $1.6 billion an increase of 35%.
So this includes expense related to Membership Rewards and to our co-brand products.
Membership Rewards was the primary driver of expense growing beyond the growth in volumes.
So I just remind you that in our co-brand products the co-brand partner has the obligation to deliver the rewards to the customer.
We pay the co-brand partner monthly and have no liability on our balance sheet.
In contrast we have the liability for the Membership Rewards program and therefore have a reserve on our balance sheet for this program.
The primary point I want to make before I review the drivers of the growth in Membership Rewards expense is that the increase reflects the cumulative impact of rewards program enhancements designed to encourage Cardmembers to earn and redeem points.
So now let's look at the drivers of Membership Rewards expense.
So the first part relates to points earned in the second quarter.
So we look at total spend.
If the ultimate redemption rate and the weighted average cost per point in the second quarter of 2011 was the same as that in the first quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012 then the increase in expense would equal the increase in spending in the period.
But it's not that simple.
We also look at bonus points and to the extent bonus points earned in the quarter as a percentage of total spend increases compared to a year-ago quarter then that will contribute to expense growth at a higher rate.
And that was the case in the second quarter of 2011.
In addition to that if the ultimate redemption rate or the average weighted cost in the second quarter of 2011 is higher than what we had in the second quarter of 2010 that would also contribute to a higher growth rate related to the points in the quarter.
Now the second part has to do with points previously earned.
So when we enter the quarter there are points that have been earned by Cardmembers that have not yet been redeemed.
And we have a balance sheet reserve for that.
And the way that's calculated is really the points that have been earned but not yet redeemed times our estimate of what the URR or the ultimate redemption rate would be -- was at the beginning of the quarter times the weighted average cost per point that we estimated at the beginning of the quarter.
So if the estimate for the ultimate redemption rate or the weighted average cost increases or decreases the balance sheet reserve needs to change accordingly.
Now you might remember in the annual report we point out that 1% or a 100-basis-point increase in the ultimate redemption rate results in a cost of $283 million.
The weighted average cost if it changes by 1 basis point costs $60 million.
So in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the cumulative impact of rewards program enhancements Cardmembers are redeeming at higher levels and we are seeing a shift in the redemption mix which is increasing the weighted average cost per point.
So in the second quarter of '11 rewards expense includes the alignment of the balance sheet reserve with the current behaviors of Cardmembers which requires an increase in the reserve and therefore an increase in expense in the second quarter.
So let me make a few final points.
While rewards did grow faster than volume in the period due to the reserve increase I mentioned we view the underlying increase in customer redemption activity as a positive outcome that logically follows the value enhancement that we have made to the program in recent years.
Redemption's rates may continue to grow somewhat.
But as we have stressed before our customers earning and redeeming points is an encouraging sign to our business model as rewards is closely linked with engagement and loyalty to the American Express brand.
We are confident that we can continue to add value to Membership Rewards program and still maintain our current on-average and over time financial targets.
Let me move to Slide 19 operating expense.
So operating expense is total expense excluding Marketing and Promotion Membership Rewards and membership services or Cardmember services and it totals $2.9 billion.
As we've discussed over the past several quarters investment spending is driving higher operating expense.
Operating expense grew at 21% 17% on an FX-adjusted basis.
And as I mentioned before if you excluded the cost of reengineering it would be 15%.
So if we look at the chart we break out those items that are growing faster than the average which are above the dotted line and those that are growing at a more modest rate which are below that line.
So within new business initiatives includes spending on LoyaltyEdge mobile and online capabilities building business insight certifying and loyalty partners.
Also above the line are higher levels of investment in GNS.
But as I mentioned before GNS has been growing at over 20% Billed business over 20% over the last 7 quarters.
So our investments are paying dividends.
Also you can see we continue to invest in sales force.
And we're investing in technology for both our core business and digital initiatives.
Below the line you can see that we are growing support functions and global services at more modest rates.
I'd also point out that the Visa-MasterCard payments are netted in operating expense.
And as you know this quarter is the last quarter that we will receive the $150 million per quarter from MasterCard.
And the fourth quarter is the last quarter we'll receive payments from Visa which is $70 million a quarter.
As I indicated last quarter we have a plan to slow the growth in operating expense and again that excludes provision rewards and marketing and promotion.
So we have a plan to slow the growth in our operating expense as we exit this year and into 2012.
The next slide is Slide 20 expense flexibility over time.
So here we're looking at adjusted expenses and this excludes provision.
So we recognize -- so this is adjusted expenses as a percentage of revenue but again excluding provision.
And we recognize that we are on elevated expense levels though adjusted expense as a percentage of revenues has started to decrease.
Over time we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways.
First through revenue growth which is to be fueled in part by the investments that we have been making in 2010 and 2011 and second through expense flexibility which includes our plans to slow the growth rate in operating expenses which I just discussed as we exit 2011 and into 2012.
Next is Slide 21 our capital ratios.
Tier 1 common has increased in the second quarter to 12.3%.
In the second quarter we generated $1.6 billion in capital $1.3 billion through net income and $300 million from employee plans.
We used $800 million for share repurchases and had a dividend of approximately $200 million.
The high level of capital is the fact that we're holding capital effectively or designed to enable acquisitions in the future.
So you remember that we've said we'll return about 50% of earnings to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and hold 50% to support growth in the business that requires growth in the balance sheet and for acquisitions.
If Basel III rules were in effect today we estimate that the Tier 1 common ratio would be about 40 basis points lower than the 12.3%.
So we continue to have strong capital ratios.
Slide 22 so this is a liquidity snapshot.
We continue to hold excess cash and marketable equity securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities.
So we're holding about $20 billion and the next 12 months' maturities are $17 billion.
Next is Slide 23 this is our U.S.
retail deposit program and you can see that direct deposits increased by $1.2 billion in the second quarter.
Third-party CDs declined by about $900 million with the weighted average remaining maturities similar to what we had last quarter at 20 months.
So total deposits increased slightly to $31.6 billion.
And deposits are providing a greater degree of funding diversity for us.
So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.
Results for the quarter reflect a continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters.
Spending growth remains strong across all business segments and geographic regions despite difficult prior-year comparisons.
We also saw a further improvement in lending trends as average loans grew year-over-year for the first time since the end of 2008 and lending credit continued to improve.
Our strong billings growth coupled with higher travel revenues and miles growth in average loans enabled us to reach our long-term revenue growth target even after adjusting for foreign exchange impacts in the quarter.
Our revenue growth rate also continues to outpace our large issuing competitors reflecting returns on our investments and the unique nature of our spend-centric business model.
Strong revenue growth improving credit trends and the benefit of lower effective tax rate provided the opportunity to invest in the business at high levels while also generating strong earnings.
These investments are driving current metrics as we deliver higher average spend grow our card base and build capabilities for the future.
We are also seeing higher customer engagement in our rewards programs which while driving higher rewards costs creates favorable economics through enhanced customer loyalty.
We're excited about the continued momentum in the business but acknowledge that the economic and regulatory environment remains uncertain.
In addition as you know we have received the last payment from MasterCard will receive the last payment from Visa in the fourth quarter and face more difficult year-over-year comparisons in light of the strong volume and credit performance in 2010 and year-to-date in 2011.
In light of these factors we are continuing to implement our plan to slow the growth of our operating expense as we exit this year and into 2012.
Our success in a highly competitive environment and unique business model are yielding high-quality results and strong revenue growth.
As spending on our network continues to grow well above industry average and our credit performance remains the best among major credit card issuers we are confident that our investments and business model are appropriately positioned to manage through the changing environment capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace.
Thanks for listening.
We're now ready to take questions.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.
Two questions for you.
On the Membership Rewards cost we saw that line expand over 30% each of the last 2 quarters.
And from your discussion it sounds like without the increase in the cost per point that should track with spending.
So in the third quarter should we expect that year-on-year growth rate to start to trend back towards the growth in Billed business? Or are we going to remain at these above-30% growth level -- growth rates for a period longer? And secondly I was hoping someone could comment on the genesis of the Facebook deal whether that was bid for or they came to you you went to them so on and so forth.
So as you know I wouldn't forecast the third quarter.
What I would say is the first quarter was impacted by a refinement in our estimation process with an element in the first quarter and why we had a growth rate that was higher than the growth in spending.
The second quarter was a little different in that it was really driven by the fact that because of the enhancements that we've made in the program we saw more engagement more redemptions on the part of our Cardmembers.
And also we saw a shift in redemption to some options that had a higher cost to it.
So the things that drove the first quarter and the second quarter were slightly different.
As I indicated we could see the URR increase somewhat in the future but that will be completely dictated by the behavior of our customers.
And really the key point here is that we want to enhance the program we want greater levels of customer engagement.
It creates loyalty.
The economics around products that have the Membership Rewards feature on it are very good.
So while engagement in the quarter causes us to align our balance sheet reserve with that behavior and therefore has expense in the period long-term we think is very good for the franchise.
So as relates to Facebook we are constantly interacting with folks in the marketplace thinking about how we can capitalize on the digital space.
So this was not a bidding process.
This was us looking to see how we can provide relevance and value to our customers broadly and in particular to small businesses.
So this is all about creating value and relevance for both customers and merchants in a way that provides a positive result both for Facebook for American Express for merchants and for customers.
And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</strong> I was hoping to get a sense of what's driving the strong spending volumes.
Obviously you guys have seen strong volume growth for some time now.
I know part of it is FX-driven.
But maybe you can just talk about how much of it is kind of new-business driven versus higher customer spend versus some commodity-inflation-related impacts.
And then just on that URR question what is the URR now versus what it was in the first quarter? And then just -- I was wondering how we should think about it from an NPV of customer relations standpoint.
I mean these higher costs is that eating into the NPV of new relationships or existing relationships versus what you had anticipated they would be when you originated them? So multiple questions there.
So the drivers of Billed business.
So even adjusting for FX 15% FX-adjusted growth is really very strong.
It's clearly at the very top end in the industry.
Based on the data we've seen so far I would suspect we'll continue to gain share which is one of our major objectives.
It is a combination of both performance of our current customers and the new customers that we're acquiring.
So while we're not seeing large percentage increases in proprietary cards the quality of the Cardmembers that we are acquiring is really very good.
So we are focused on high spenders who want to utilize charge cards.
We're also focused on premium lending.
And at the end of the day we're providing a value proposition to both new customers and existing customers that are causing them to decide to spend on our products as opposed to someone else's.
At the end of the day it's a combination of the rewards programs that we've put in place and the enhancements that we have made as well as the customer service that we provide.
And as you know and I said many times J.D.
Power does the survey for the industry.
As relates to service we've been #1 for several years.
So I think it's a combination of all those factors and the investments that we've been making over the past couple of years that are paying off with higher levels of spend.
So to move to your second question about the ultimate redemption rate the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter we indicated was 92%.
The ultimate redemption rate is also 92% in the second quarter.
Now as I said we've actually seen a tick-up in redemptions.
So in the first quarter it was 92% but we were actually rounding up to get to 92%.
In the second quarter we were at 92% but we're rounding down to 92%.
So there's been an increase in what we have reserved in terms of ultimate redemption rate from the first to the second quarter but they both round to 92%.
The third question regarding the NPV of customers so the NPV of customers that we're acquiring continues to be very strong.
As you know when we acquire customers we think about not the cost to acquire them solely in this year or what their performance is next year but it's really their performance over many many years to figure out the economic value of that investment.
And those investments acquiring the customers continue to be good.
In terms of is it impacting the margins on existing customers to the extent we are successful in putting the right value proposition out there we avoid attrition right? And if we have attrition higher attrition then we need to acquire more new Cardmembers.
So the fact that these enhancements are lowering attrition has a very strong economic benefit attached to it.
And as I said in my comments when I was going over the slides we are comfortable that we can continue to enhance the Membership Rewards program and still maintain our current financial targets.
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.
I guess not to continue to ask about rewards but I did have a broader question which is when we look at Cap One and Discover and I'm sure if we could see it at Chase it seems like everyone has rewards charges happening or at least the 4 of you do.
And it also seems like the 4 of you are all kind of now moving into double-digit spend volume growth whereas some of the other competitors are still stuck in the single-digits or even flat.
So I guess what's the risk that there's just kind of a broader industry rewards war kind of happening and the few issuers who are moving market share will just structurally have to pay more to keep it going forward? So there has been a war for the premium end of the payments industry for 15 years.
And if we were back 10 or 15 years ago we would be talking about people wanting to move into our space.
And if we were complacent I think we would lose share.
But we're not.
We continue to innovate.
We continue to improve the value proposition that we provide to customers.
That's a combination of rewards Cardmember services servicing.
It's also us being cognizant that our customers want to be able to utilize the digital space more.
We are very focused on that.
You can see the recent announcements that we've made with Foursquare with Facebook.
I think those are all reflections of us innovating and providing value to customers.
Now as we do that it's important that we have the right business model to not only grow Billed business and grow revenues but to have the right profitability associated to that.
And again over the last decade I think we have continued to have the right level of profitability.
And we think we have sufficient flexibility in our business model to continue to achieve our financial targets.
So I think you're right there's a very competitive landscape out there.
We've been successful competing in that market and we think we will continue to be successful as we go forward.
If I can ask a follow-up can you remind us where we stand on all things on the litigation front DOJ and the Visa merchant suit? And I know there's only so much you can say on things like this but just any progress updates or milestones we should be watching for in the near term? DOJ was in the paper today as the cause I guess approved the settlement agreement between DOJ and Visa-MasterCard.
As we've said in the past we have provisions non-discriminatory provisions in our contract.
We believe that if the merchant accepts American Express that when the Cardmember chooses to use that our product that they're not discriminated against.
We also do not believe that we have market power.
If you don't have market power it's hard to see how we're driving anticompetitive behaviors.
So we continue to plan to vigorously defend our position as it relates to DOJ.
As it relates to the Visa merchant suit you'd have to really talk to them about where that stands.
Our next question will be coming from the line of Bruce Harting with Barclays Capital.
Any comments on the stronger card growth rest of world versus U.S.
and then if I just look at -- stack up Billed business growth by your 4 businesses versus discount revenue growth and rewards cost it looks like percentage changed year-over-year.
It looks like the stronger growth in all 3 categories is the ICS and the GCS and GNMS.
And any comments on what you're seeing if you're just allocating more marketing spend or co-brand overseas and trends there.
And then just to the degree that you have your comment you plan to slow growth of expense excluding provision marketing and rewards will that other other expense line be -- is there anything you can say forward-looking on where to expect the 220 toward the MasterCard fee in 3Q and 4Q where the biggest change will come? Okay so that's lots of questions.
Hopefully I don't miss some.
So if you look at Slide 4 you're right that they are growing at slightly different growth rates with GNS being the strongest.
When we look at card growth internationally a lot of that is being driven -- or GNS is growing cards at a faster rate than the proprietary business is growing in.
I think that's a reflection of us or of our partners recognizing the value of issuing products that run on our network.
Those additional cards are driving the growth in Billings that we've seen.
And as I pointed out this has been a success story over many years and certainly over the last 7 quarters GNS has grown greater than 20%.
So I think that's a very good story.
And while GNS is growing faster than the other segments if you look at Slide 4 you can see that each segment on an FX-adjusted basis is growing in the double-digits and they all have been doing it for 4 or 5 quarters.
So I think the breadth of the growth in Billed business is encouraging and the stability of that growth is also encouraging.
So even though there are slight variations I think we're being successful across all the segments U.S.
consumer U.S.
small business International Consumer Commercial Card globally they all have really very very good growth rates.
So there's some differentiation but I think they're good.
I would say that we -- and we have said that we think there is lots of opportunity in international markets.
And so we have allocated more resources in terms of investment dollars to International.
And we expect to get good returns on that.
I think the investments we've been making broadly across the company I think reflect that.
Also the fact that on a regional basis we've also had double-digit growth across all the regions again is encouraging because it's so broad-based.
And again we've had double-digit growth across the regions on an FX-adjusted basis for several quarters.
So that's a positive.
So switching to expenses and other other.
So other other has the credit related to the settlement payments we receive from Visa-MasterCard.
So you should expect the absence of the $150 million from MasterCard next quarter just have that line pop up.
And when we get to the first quarter of 2012 and we no longer have the Visa $70 million it will pop up again.
So as we focus on operating expense there are lots of resources there.
I think it's $2.9 billion.
We're looking at the composite of that and how we utilize those resources.
So we'll be looking to slow the growth in operating expense as we exit this year and go into next year.
We won't necessarily be focused on each individual line item but in aggregate it's our goal to slow the growth rate in operating expense.
So I don't know if I remembered all of your questions.
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane from JPMorgan.
When we look at the Card Billed business domestically both on a sequential and year-over-year basis the revenue growth falls behind on both metrics.
And Dan you've made the comment that there are some contra revenue items running through there and you specifically mentioned corporate rebates and partner payments.
Can you just give us a sense of how much of that's recurring? Are these performance-driven milestone-type payments? Are they upfront payments? Help us understand what's going on there please.
So I think Billed business growth in the U.S.
is really quite strong and very similar to the aggregate Billed business growth.
So we're not seeing domestic U.S.
spending falling behind.
It continues to be quite good.
If you're looking at discount revenue growing at 16% instead of 18% if you look at GNS Billings we share some of the discount rate with our partners.
So the revenues related to those Billings are lower than if we have proprietary Billings.
GNS has very good economics good profitability excellent ROE.
It just happened to have less discount rate attached to each solidly [ph].
That's one of the factors.
When you look at contra revenue whether the incentive to corporate customers or partner payments I think the vast majority of those are volume-related.
And that's the primary driver.
There may be some exceptions in there but I think the vast majority are performance-based at the end of the day.
So even if it winds up with a slightly lower discount rate it still has very good economics attached to it.
So if you're looking at U.S.
Card Services information in our supplements or on the tables the revenue line says discount revenue net card fees and other.
And so you're looking at 8% growth.
That's really being driven by card fees in the other revenue lines not by poor performance in Billed business.
So you're saying that card fees in the other lines are flattish and that the mix is driving that.
Yes.
I don't have it right in front of me all those line items but if you look at the consolidated numbers net card fees are growing at 5%.
Our next question will come from the line of Kenneth Bruce with Bank of America.
Thank you for providing additional disclosure around rewards expense and I appreciate that.
It gives us a lot to think about.
When you talk about the marketing and promotion expense historically running around 9% that was very helpful.
Is there a level that we can think about in terms of rewards expense relative to Billings historically that you would consider to be the average for that mix of business at the time? And could you provide us with what the URR would be associated with that? So if you were to go back in history rewards expense as a percentage of revenues would have been lower than what it is today.
And in part that's because in the first quarter and the second quarter we've had this greater engagement by our customers and therefore a higher ultimate redemption rate and cost per point that's related to the volume of those periods but also the alignment of the reserve with the most recent customer behaviors.
So we have many levers within our business model that we can utilize.
We can decide to acquire higher-quality customers that reduces provision as a percentage of revenue.
We can decide to provide greater rewards.
We could spend more money on acquiring customers utilizing MNP we could hire more people at sales force we could hire more people to build analytical capabilities or risk capabilities.
So these are all the different ways we can use our resources and we make decisions as we think about what our strategies are going to be and how we're going to provide value to our customers and our merchants.
And we really over the course of time make those trade-offs.
So I think going to one period and saying they're X and then try to compare them solely to another period without factoring in all the other levers that we're pulling would be kind of taking something out of context.
So I think you need to look at each of these expenses as a percentage of revenue within the context of the period that you're in.
Thank you.
I think -- we appreciate that.
I guess you were kind enough to give us the 7% or the 9% as a run rate of normal.
I'm trying to baseline your rewards expense it was 65 basis points of Billings back for pre-recession and I'm wondering if that's not 65 basis points going forward how we should be thinking about that.
And I understand that there's lots of different levers I'm just trying to find a baseline.
And I don't know if you're just not able or willing to provide that but that's what I'm asking.
So certainly there would be a percentage a basis point you can calculate off of Billed business.
And that would be a number that gradually changes.
And to the extent there are periods where we adjust the balance sheet for either refinements in our estimation process or based on greater engagement on the part of our customers in those periods you're going to see additional expense in those quarters.
And I suspect that will be the case going forward.
Just a follow-up can you remind us how much of the revenue quarter-over-quarter was increase due to the first quarter acquisition? There was one month in the first quarter for the acquisition and I think you've got a full quarter of revenue in expenses.
Can you provide us with that detail here? And then just as we think about acquisitions going forward of the 8%-or-better revenue growth how much of that would you expect to be acquisition-related? So we have not disclosed in the quarter what loyalty partners is.
What we did say is that at the time of the acquisition that in 2010 loyalty partners full year revenues were about $300 million.
So you can think about that in terms of the contribution they're making in the second quarter.
In terms of the 8% target that we have and what piece will come from acquisitions the 8% has been our target for a while.
And as you know we have not really been an acquisitive company and we were -- had that as our target.
So it all depends where you're allocating resources at the end of the day.
So we don't have a specific carve-out going forward for what acquisitions will contribute.
It really depends on the nature of the acquisition what the contribution will be.
So I would think about 8% as something probably we can achieve from an organic perspective and then what acquisitions contribute will be depending on the nature of the acquisition.
Our next question comes from John Stilmar with SunTrust.
Inc.</strong> To follow up kind of a little bit to Ken's prior question Dan I was wondering if you could provide for as a little bit more specificity on the path to the operating leverage that we've been discussing now for several quarters.
And now as we kind of see that clearly rewards themselves are a higher cost and although that's not part of your target for expense flexibility I'm wondering if you can prioritize for us as we move forward how much of your enthusiasm for reaching those goals comes from purchasing higher-margin businesses actual expense-cutting or really just top line revenue growth coming from existing platform to be able to give you that operating leverage.
I'm wondering if you can kind of prioritize which is the bigger driver of the path from here to there.
That would be helpful.
And then following up with that we've gotten the final rules from Durbin.
I was wondering if you think about your Prepaid segment any differently today in terms of the services that you would offer and the functionality that you would attach to your Prepaid debit business post-Durbin because of some the nuances in that final bill.
So as it relates to operating leverage we don't plan to get there through an acquisition.
That's not part of our plan.
We really plan to get there in 2 ways.
One is we expect that -- we've seen already that the investments we've been making have been paying off in terms of good performance in our metrics in revenue so one way part of it is growth in revenues.
And the other part is related to operating expense and to have the growth rate in operating expense to slow as we exit the year and as we go into 2012.
So those will be the 2 primary drivers of improving operating leverage at the end of the day.
As it relates to Durbin and Prepaid I would say that -- point out that our Prepaid product is not subject to Durbin okay.
We were excluded from that.
It refers to debit products issued by the banks.
So Durbin doesn't have an impact on our Prepaid business.
We think the Prepaid business is a very good growth business.
We have a good position in that market.
We've recently issued new products that if you buy them online and reload them online don't have any purchase fees.
There's no back-end fees there's no maintenance fees.
So we think it's really quite an attractive product in a market that we believe will continue to grow.
So we're pretty positive about our space there.
Our next question comes from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.
Inc.</strong> I'm wondering if you could give us some color on trends in card spending during the quarter.
Was gasoline much -- did gasoline prices have much of an impact in the U.S.
and is there any change in mix outside the USA? I guess I wondered related to that on the increase in the weighted average cost of redemption on rewards we're seeing presumably an increase in travel-related rewards and is that kind of coincident with higher travel spending? So gas -- so I think the increase in Billed business is very broad-based okay? I think travel is one of the components that is growing nicely but it's really very broad-based across many merchant categories and I think it's reflective of the fact that we have a very affluent Cardmember base and those Cardmembers have the ability to spend and pay.
I think that's a factor.
As we've said other times gas is not a big factor in terms of driving Billed business or discount rate for us.
Certainly the slight decline that we saw in discount rate does reflect a shift in where our customers are spending.
As we broaden our merchant base it's often in new categories that are at lower rates than our average discount rate.
And I think the strong growth in International is also contributing to the slightly lower discount rate.
But growth is very broad-based which again is an encouraging sign.
But in terms of weighted average cost per point on Membership Rewards I think we are seeing a shift to travel-related redemption options.
I think that's a reflection of the fact that in '09 we probably had a shift going in the other direction where people were using rewards less for travel and more for everyday type of items.
And I think as we move further away from 2009 we're seeing a logical shift back to more travel-related type of redemptions and therefore it's having the impact of shifting the weighted average cost per point up.
Inc.</strong> So the weighted average cost up from where it was in pre-2009 period when you had sort of similar mix of travel redemptions or the...
So I don't have that off the top of my head where it was pre-'09.
But certainly it's up from the most recent quarters that we had.
Inc.</strong> It's one of the first times you've raised the weighted average cost because you spend a lot of effort kind of providing additional redemption options to lower the average cost.
I think we provide additional redemption items because we think many of the program participants value them highly.
It does have the benefit that some of them have a lower average cost but we're really trying to accomplish 2 things: one is the weighted average cost and providing value to Cardmembers.
But you're correct that we have normally spoken about ultimate redemption rate.
And the weighted average cost has had a lesser effect than ultimate redemption rate so it was a factor so we through it was important to mention.
Inc.</strong> I was wondering if you can speak to what kind of the maximum is on the ultimate redemption rate.
I mean it's certainly not 100%.
Yes so it can't be more than 100% and it probably in all likelihood won't be 100%.
But where it ultimately goes to probably has a lot to do with the value that we can continue to put in the program and the enhancements we make.
But it will be speculative to try to guess at where it goes to.
So I'll take just one more question.
Our final question will be coming from the line of Mike Taiano with Sandler O'Neill.
Dan just on the rewards obviously both URR and WAC are up.
Can you give us maybe a sense of the pace of increase in the second quarter relative to what it's been in the prior quarters? Has it accelerated? Decelerated? Any additional color you can give us there? So the first time we disclosed the ultimate redemption rate for active employees was at the end of '07.
And we indicated it was about 90%.
It was pretty flat in 2008 and so we disclosed it in the annual report again it was 90%.
There was some modest increase in the following year 2010.
But there was a pickup in the pace in -- 2009 I guess it was modest increase.
In 2010 it picked up and we disclosed it was 91%.
And obviously with the refinement in how we were estimating URR in the first quarter popped up to 92%.
So again it is higher now than it was back in '07 or '08.
But again we view the fact that we are enhancing the program and we're getting better loyalty and engagement from an economic point of view we view that as very positive with very good economics.
And that's the -- and it provides value to our Cardmembers.
So a combination of all those things.
We view the Membership Rewards program as really a very important part of our value proposition with good economics which is I think is the key factor.
Just one last follow-up on the growth rate in Global Commercial Services.
Seems like it's decelerated over the last year or so.
Is there something in there? Was it the GE acquisition that drove it higher in the prior year or just something else that's causing it to trend a little bit lower? I don't think it's GE.
I think GE is far enough back in our history that that wouldn't be a factor.
Commercial Card generally when recession is coming hold out longer and then drops very quickly.
But it also comes back quicker than most of the other categories.
So that could have been a factor in the higher growth rate that you saw in the early part of 2010.
But the growth rate again is double-digits and continues to be very good.
And we continue to be successful in the marketplace with Commercial Card globally.
So we're very pleased by the performance of Commercial Card.
Okay so with that thank you everyone for joining the call.
Take care.
And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by.
Welcome to the American Express Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Good evening.
We appreciate everyone joining us for today's discussion.
Before I turn it over to our CFO Dan Henry I do need to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the SEC.
In the third quarter 2011 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides all of which are now listed on our website at ir.americanexpress.com we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some of -- some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dan completes his remarks we will open the line for Q&amp;A.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay thanks Rick.
I'll start on Slide 2 Summary of Financial Performance.
The revenues net of interest expense was $7.6 billion 9% higher than the prior year.
Now this growth rate is down slightly from the second quarter but it is best-in-class compared to issuing competitors.
On an FX-adjusted basis it's 6% growth.
Net income came in at $1.2 billion 13% higher than last year and EPS is $1.03.
Return on equity is 28% and you can see that shares outstanding have decreased and that's a result of share repurchases which I'll cover in more detail later.
We move to Slide 3 Metric Performance.
You can see the Billed business was $207.7 billion up 16% and 13% on an FX-adjusted basis.
So Billed business again showed strong growth.
It's the seventh quarter in a row that we've had strong Billed business growth.
We are growing over strong growth last year while our competitors' spending growth last year -- while improving or growing the overall lower growth rates the year before.
Cards-in-force are 95.8 million cards up 8%.
That represents 21% growth in cards in GNS and 2% growth in proprietary cards.
Average spend continues to increase reflecting the high level of engagement of our Cardmember base.
Cardmember Loans are up 2% the same growth rate that we saw in the second quarter.
And travel sales grew 13% driven primarily by air sales.
Moving to Slide 4.
So this is Billed Business Growth by Segment and we continue to have broad-based growth across all segments.
Total Billed business growth decreased about 2% compared to the second quarter.
If we look at USCS it came in at 12% down 1% from the second quarter; Global Corporate Products is at 14% also down 1% from the second quarter; GNS continues to be very strong at 23% down 2% from the second quarter; and International Consumer came in at 9% again 2% down from the second quarter.
So we see a slight decline across each segment.
But Billed business is holding up well considering the economic uncertainty.
Given these strong growth rates we would expect to gain share again this quarter in the U.S.
Moving to Slide 5 this is Billed Business Growth by Region.
So Billed business growth by region on an FX-adjusted basis if we look at Asia it came in at 19% the same growth rate as the second quarter.
Latin America and Canada is at 14% down 1% from the second quarter.
The U.S.
is at 13% again down 1% from the second quarter.
EMEA came in at 8% down from 11% in the second quarter.
However we continue to have strong growth in a number of countries in Europe.
Germany grew 10% France 8% and U.K.
12%.
Now they're each down between 100 and 300 basis points.
On an absolute basis it is good growth.
So we have very good broad-based growth across the regions although more softness in Europe.
If you look at Slide 6 so this is Lending Billed Business compared to Managed Loan Growth.
So the solid line is the growth in spending on lending products and this is at 14% in the third quarter.
That compares to 18% in the second quarter of this year and 15% in the third quarter of 2010.
The dotted line is growth in loans and you can see that it is at 2% the same as the second quarter.
We continue to have a spread between the growth in spending on lending products and the growth in loan balances.
This is due in part to our actions as we have changed our strategy to focus on Charge Card and premium lending.
So just as an aside Charge Card Billed business and receivable growth continue to move in tandem.
But getting back to lending our lending focus on premium lending and the reduction in balance transfers results in a base that is more inclined to be transactors and revolve less.
So if we went back to the second quarter of '08 transactors would have represented about 16% of our portfolio.
In the third quarter of 2011 transactors represent 29% of the portfolio.
If we were to look at the lending trust and look at payments rates in September the payment rate was 31.23% and that's up from September of 2010 when it was 29.28%.
So the combination of our focus on premium lending and the fact that cardmembers are deciding to delever is resulting in the spread in the growth rates between spending and loan balances.
For us the net effect is a lower risk profile.
So if you look at Slide 7 which is Net Interest Yield in the third quarter of this year it is very much in line with our previous guidance.
It comes in at 9% and we had indicated that yield would migrate back to historic levels either in the high 8s or 9%.
They reflect the changes in pricing that we did related to the CARD Act and also cardmember behavior.
Going forward yield will continue to be influenced by a number of factors including credit quality revolve rates and the cost of funds.
They are also a subject to regulatory review through the look back.
The stability that we see in yield and the 2% growth in loan balance is resulting in net interest income in the second quarter being flat with the second quarter of last year.
If we move to Slide 8 Revenue Performance discount revenue reflects the 16% growth in Billed business growth.
But the reason that this is growing at 12% is a result of the slight decline in the discount rate the relative faster growth of GNS Billed business and for GNS we get a part of the discount rate and higher contra-revenue items including corporate incentives and partner payments.
Now the discount rate is at 2.54 the same as the second quarter of this year but 2 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year driven primarily by a change in mix.
As we have said in the past the discount rate will decrease as we succeed in our everyday spend strategy and to the extent we have a change in mix by country.
Net card fees grew 6% primarily reflecting a mix shift to higher fee cards and slightly higher proprietary cards-in-force.
Travel commissions and fees are down 1% and this reflects increased worldwide travel sales offset by a decrease in sales commission rates as well as the fact that last year we had revenue recognition upon the signing of certain supplier contracts.
Other commission fees are driven primarily by the fact that we have acquired Loyalty Partners.
So their fees and commissions are in this year but were not in last year.
Other revenues reflect higher GNS partner royalty revenues higher foreign exchange fees and higher merchant fees.
Net interest income is flat and this is the first time in many quarters that we are flat and this is a result of the slightly -- the slight growth in loans offset by a slightly lower yield compared to last year.
Total revenues net of interest growth of 9% is notably better than the other issuing competitors and it reflects the difference in our business model where we focused on driving fee income and spend compared to them who are more focused and reliant on net spread income.
So fundamentally we have a different business model.
But generally when we talk about our revenues we indicated about 80% of our revenues are fee-related and 20% are related to net spread.
But in fact in this quarter net interest income only represents about 16% of our revenues where our competitors often have between 50% and 80% of their revenues dependent on net interest income.
So if we move to Slide 9 Provision For Losses we can see that the Charge Card provision is at $174 million up from $84 million last year.
That's the result of slightly higher dollar write-offs in this quarter but it also reflects a lower reserve release that we had last year.
So Charge Card improved faster and most of the benefit from reserve releases have taken place at this point so the major difference is higher reserve releases in the third quarter of 2010.
But credit performance is really excellent and credit metrics are at historic lows.
If we look at Cardmember Loans our lending provision it is at $48 million compared to $261 million in the third quarter of 2010.
So the third quarter of 2011 reflects lower dollar write-offs.
So the dollar write-offs in this quarter were $427 million and that compares with $809 million of write-offs in the third quarter of 2010.
Now that is partially offset by us having lower reserve releases in this quarter this year compared to last year.
And again we see excellent credit performance and really credit metrics and that are at historic lows.
Moving to Slide 10 so this is Charge Card Credit Performance.
You can see that the write-off rate in Charge Card portfolios both the U.S.
Consumer business International Consumer and Global Corporate Products have increased slightly both sequentially and compared to last year but they remain at historic lows.
So the slight increase in Charge Card metrics align with the company's Charge Card strategic objectives of growing and expanding this business.
Our objective is to grow the business profitably and not to have the lowest write-off rate so you should expect these metrics to increase in the future as we grow this business.
Moving to Slide 11 Lending Write-off Rates so the lending write-off rates continue to improve both in the U.S.
and in the International Consumer business.
In the third quarter for 2011 the write-off rate is 2.6%.
That compares with 3.1% in the second quarter of this year and 5.1% in the third quarter of 2010.
If we look at the lending trust in the U.S.
the write-off rate in September was 2.3% down from 2.7% in August.
Again these are historic lows.
If we go to Slide 12 we look at lending 30 Day Past Due the 30-day past due in the United States is stable in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and the International Consumer metric continues to improve.
Here if we were to look at the lending trust and look at 30-days past due that number in July was 1.5 improved in August to 1.4 and in September was back to 1.5.
So I think we are seeing stabilization of this metric in the current quarter.
If we move to Slide 13 so this slide is intended to give some insight as we look forward.
If we start on the right-hand side we can see that bankruptcies continue to trend down.
And I'd remind you that at the time that we're notified of bankruptcies generally 2/3 of those accounts have already been written off.
So if we look to the left side and look at the upper left chart and these are balances that roll from current to 30-days past due.
If you look at the green triangles so these are accounts that rolled in February March and April of this year these accounts will write off 5 months later if they continue to be delinquent.
So the green triangles wrote off in the third quarter of this year.
If we look next to that to the next 3 blue triangles you can see that they are slightly lower than the green triangles.
If the 30-due past day -- 30-day past due to write-off rate which is the bottom left chart remains constant then we would expect in the fourth quarter of this year for write-offs to be slightly lower than the third quarter but that's also dependent on bankruptcies and recoveries remaining unchanged.
So the pace of improvement in our credit metrics have slowed and we have now reached all-time lows.
Again our objective is not to manage our business in order to minimize write-off rates.
Going forward we will continue to balance our risk profile with the company's strategic growth objectives and over time we do not expect loss rate to stay at these historic lows.
Moving to Slide 14 so this is looking at Lending Reserve Releases.
So the chart shows lending reserve releases across the top by quarter.
The light blue bar are the dollar write-offs in the quarter and the dark blue bar is provision which are the write-off dollars less the reserve releases.
So the third quarter reserve release was approximately the same as in the second quarter but less than we saw in the first quarter of this year as the improvement in metrics have started to moderate or stabilize.
In the third quarter of 2010 we had $500 million of reserve releases.
Going forward we would expect reserve releases to diminish.
Going to Slide 15 so this is Lending Reserve Coverage and we can see that as credit metrics continue to improve reserves as a percentage of loans and reserves as a percentage of past due have come down both for U.S.
Card and worldwide.
So although we had reserve releases of $400 million in the quarter coverage remains at appropriate levels.
Moving to Slide 16 Expense Performance.
Total expenses increased 13% or 11% on an FX-adjusted basis.
Marketing and promotion decreased 13% from the third quarter of 2010 when we hit record levels of spending.
Marketing is still 10% of revenues above the historic level of about 9% of revenues.
So we still have healthy levels of investment and I'll talk about this more in a moment.
Cardmember rewards and service cost increased 25% but at a lower growth rate than the second quarter.
This reflects rewards-related spending both in MR and on co-brand products.
Plus within MR it also reflects the impact of a small increase in the ultimate redemption rate which reflects higher engagement and higher redemption levels.
The cost of cardmember service increased reflecting the cost of new benefits for U.S.
cardmembers.
Operating expense increased 15%.
But if you exclude the impact of the Visa/MasterCard settlement this expense operating expense grew 9% year-over-year a notable slowing from the growth rate of 21% in the second quarter.
We expect to further slow operating expense growth rate towards the end of this year and into next year and I'll speak about that more in a few minute -- moments.
The tax rate of 28% reflects a benefit related to the distribution of foreign earnings with the associated realization of foreign tax credits.
We increased our investment levels in the quarter above previously planned levels in light of this benefit.
So if we move to Slide 17 so this is some more detail on marketing expense.
And here each of the bars reflect spending by quarter.
As discussed in prior quarters the high level in investment spending in marketing and promotion has been enabled by the credit provision benefits from improving credit and the Visa/MasterCard settlement payments.
As these credit benefits lessen over time and the Visa and MasterCard payment cease we have the flexibility to move marketing and promotion back towards historical levels or 9% of revenues.
Moving to Slide 18 so this is more detail on operating expense.
So if we look at salaries and employee benefit it increased 18% reflecting a higher level of employees merit increases higher benefits severance costs related to reengineering and higher incentive compensation.
If we look at professional services this decreased 2% reflecting lower collection cost as you would expect as credit improves and lower consulting fees.
The increase in occupancy cost is primarily driven by Loyalty Partners which is in this year's numbers but are not in last year's number.
We've also broken out the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds so you can see those.
In total you can see that we have made progress on our objective of slowing the growth in operating expense.
So reported it's at 15%.
Excluding Visa/MasterCard it grew at 9% and that compares with 21% in the second quarter of this year.
We expect to further slow the operating expense growth rate towards the end of this year and into next year.
Slide 19 this is more detail on operating expense and this chart is intended to show the areas where we are investing and growing at a faster rate.
And there's a difference between those operating expenses which are intended to drive growth and those which are more BAU operating expenses which are growing at a slower rate.
So at the upper left-hand side you see new business initiatives and they include spending on Serve Online Mobile the Certify Loyalty Partners LoyaltyEdge and Business insights.
You can also see that we're investing in GNS.
And if you look back over the last 8 quarters we have had Billed business growth of over 20% so those investments are paying off.
We continue to invest in sales force across International Consumer Global Corporate Products and Merchant Services.
Variable tech investments generally have been around the average growth rate as they support growth in both our core business and our digital initiatives.
And you can see that support functions and Global Services are growing at more modest rates.
So operating expense relates both to our ongoing operations and our growth initiatives.
Looking at Slide 20 so this has to do with expense flexibility and here adjusted expense are all expenses excluding provision divided by revenues.
Now here we recognize that we are currently at elevated levels.
Over time we expect this ratio to migrant back towards historical levels in 2 ways: First through the growth in revenues; and second through expense flexibility related to really all items in the P&amp;L.
The continued higher investment levels which were enabled by our tax credit is why our rate has stayed at 75% in the third quarter of this year.
Moving to Slide 21 Capital Ratios you can see that Tier 1 common ratio remained at 12.3% the same as the second quarter.
So the capital that we generated through net income and employee plans was offset by the distribution we made through repurchases and dividends while risk-weighted assets stayed relatively level.
So the 2.3% is higher than our target for Tier 1 common and this is due to the fact that we had fewer acquisitions than we planned.
As you remember our guidelines are to retain about 50% of capital generated to support the growth of our balance sheet and acquisitions and to return to shareholders about 50% of capital generated through dividends and share repurchase.
In the third quarter we increased our share repurchase given the limited amount of balance sheet growth and the fewer acquisitions but we continued to have strong capital ratios.
If we move to Slide 22 this is Total Payout Ratio.
So this is a new slide and this is the percentage of capital generated in each quarter or year that was returned to shareholders.
So if we look at 2008 '09 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 basically the return of capital to shareholders was through dividends.
In the second quarter of this year we did repurchases of $750 million and in the third quarter we increased repurchases to $1.2 billion given the level of balance sheet growth and acquisitions.
Even with 105% payout in the third quarter our Tier 1 common remain at 12.3%.
Fourth quarter repurchases are projected to be $350 million.
As part of our request that we made in our CCAR filing to the fed in January we requested total repurchases of $3.2 billion -- $2.3 billion thank you and so therefore we have about $350 million left of capacity.
If we go to the next slide Slide 23 looking at liquidity we can see that we continue to hold excess cash and multiple securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities.
So we're holding $22 billion in cash and securities and our maturities over the next 12 months are $19 billion.
If we slide -- moving to Slide 24 so this is our deposit programs.
So total deposits increased by about $1 billion from $31.6 billion to $32.5 billion in the quarter.
Since we did not have balance sheet growth it did not warrant additional or higher funding level.
As we've discussed deposits provide greater diversity in funding for us.
So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.
Results for the quarter reflect a continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters.
Spending growth remains strong and we continue to grow faster than most of our large issuing competitors despite difficult prior year comparisons and a challenging economic environment especially in Europe where growth slowed but is still very healthy at 8% on an FX-adjusted basis.
We also saw our average loans grow year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter and lending loss rates continue to improve.
Our strong billings growth coupled with flat net interest income drove solid revenue growth which continue to outpace our large issuing competitors reflecting returns on our investments and the unique nature of our spend-centric business model.
Solid revenue growth improving credit trends and the benefit of lower effective tax rate provided the opportunity to continue to invest in the business at high levels while also generating strong earnings.
These investments are driving current metrics as we deliver high average spending and grow our card base as well as build capabilities for the future.
We feel very good about our recent performance while we acknowledge that the economic environment remains uncertain.
We continue to implement our plan to slow the year-over-year growth in our operating expense as we exit this year and into 2012.
And in the third quarter we began to see some progress towards that goal at adjusted operating expense which excludes the MasterCard receipt grew 9% versus 21% in the second quarter.
Our success in a highly competitive environment and our focus on spending as opposed to spread are yielding high-quality results and solid revenue growth.
Going forward we will closely monitor our spending and credit trends but to date we are very pleased with our results and we are confident that our investments and business model are appropriately positioned to navigate through this environment.
Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions.
[Operator Instructions] We now go to our first question Mr.
Don Fandetti with Citigroup.
Research Division</strong> Dan I was wondering if you could provide a little color on where Billed business trends are in October overall and then maybe whether or not Europe's continued to sort of soften a bit or if that stabilized.
So spend growth continues to hold up well in the fourth quarter.
However we are just a few weeks into the quarter and we will watch spending trends closely as we go forward in the next coming months.
Research Division</strong> And on Europe? I think -- I'd say we're holding up well although we saw greater softness in Europe in the third quarter.
So we'll have to see how that pans out as we go through this quarter.
Next we go to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Research Division</strong> Question on Rewards.
The Rewards expense as a percentage of discount revenue was 37% this quarter.
And if you go back a couple of years ago it was running at the 30% level.
And I mean you've been bringing up your redemption rate.
You said you brought it up a little bit more this quarter.
And I was redeeming some points myself the other day it's awfully easy to do.
And so I don't know why I wouldn't redeem all of them easily over time but is there -- how much was the one-time hit this quarter for higher redemption rate? And I mean is this run rate is that permanent? So we're pleased you redeemed your points.
We believe that to the extent cardmembers redeem points we have greater engagement.
They spend more with us.
We have lower attrition.
So the economics associated with that we think are very positive for the franchise over time.
So in any given period the Membership Rewards expense is going to be driven by 2 primary -- well 3 primary factors.
One where the volumes are.
And so to the extent we have volume growth we're going to have growth in expense related to that.
And the other 2 factors are the ultimate redemption rate and the weighted average cost per point.
Now to the extent that we are having higher levels of engagement higher redemptions by customers we take that new information and put it into our calculation of what we think the ultimate redemption rate is going to be.
And to the extent that it's higher then we are going to have higher expense related to that.
I went through a explanation on the call last quarter that says expense is really a combination of the activity and the current period as well as repricing our bank which is very large which is a good asset for us but that repricing results in additional expense.
To the extent the redemption rates are going up we would see growth rates on that expense line in excess of the spend growth in the quarter.
So what happens in the future is going to be very dependent on the behavior of our customers in future quarters.
If in fact it runs at a slightly higher rate then the growth in Billed business or spending again I would view that as a positive.
The growth rate in this quarter is less than we saw in the second quarter and that's because the growth in the redemption rate in the third quarter was somewhat less than the growth rate and the ultimate redemption rate that we saw in the second quarter.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Follow-up question just on share repurchases when and how do you go back to request more -- essentially you bought back 2% of the company this quarter and your capital ratios didn't change.
And I know you're looking at acquisitions so maybe thoughts around the -- I mean a little color on how you expect to reload the share repurchase authorization from the government if you will or from the fed.
Okay last year the fed had ourselves and I think all other bank holding companies submit filings which reflected what our base plan was for the coming year.
Also required us to have projections in an adverse and a more stressful environment that they reviewed.
We made their request for share buybacks as part of that filing.
Now our request for share buybacks was based on this notion that we would distribute about 50% of generated capital back to shareholders and retain about 50% for growth in the balance sheet and acquisitions.
So the 2.3 was our amount.
Now we performed well during this year.
Balance sheet growth has not been significant and we've made some acquisitions but not at the level that would warrant maintaining 50% of the capital.
Now we could have ventured to make a new request to the fed in the recent month or so but we thought it was more prudent just to address what we think our needs will be next year in the filing that we will do this January related to the required filing not related to 2012.
So we will be mindful of this year's experience as we make our request for next year.
Next we go to the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> On the expense line you guys came in at 75% I think a little higher than some of us have been looking for but you did mention there was too the tax credit.
And I know that your guidance calls for -- the rate of change is slow.
So can you just help us understand your ability to generate positive operating leverage? And at what point will we see revenue growth exceed expense growth? And I have another one after that.
As I think we have been in a situation really over the past 2 years through 2010 2011 where we have had very good credit performance.
That results as you know in the release reserves and we've had the Visa/MasterCard proceeds.
And we've decided to use that money to in part improve earnings and in part invest in the future to drive business momentum.
And that's what's really resulted in that ratio staying up at that 75% level or so.
As we slow the growth in expense as you would expect to see that ratio come back down.
It's going to come back down really in 2 ways.
One is the growth in revenues and second is the slowing of the growth in expenses.
In this period if we hadn't had the tax benefit then we would have ratcheted back investments and you would have actually seen that percentage come back down.
But since we knew we had the tax benefit coming we decided to invest it and therefore it starts -- it stayed at higher level.
So you would think over the coming quarters you would start to see that percentage to come down if we execute against our plans.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just on the lending side I think you had alluded to when you've had the conference last month that you would expect that losses would be lower than the 4.5% that you had historically had.
But I guess numbers are running significantly lower than that and your lending strategy has changed so much.
So can you just help us understand either in numerically or contextually how you're thinking about where losses will eventually stabilize? I'll do it contextually.
Research Division</strong> I figured I'd at least try.
So 4.5% is the rate we had over a 10-year period going back.
As you said we have changed our strategy.
We are focused on premium lending.
So I would expect it to as I said before be below that 4.5% and I would expect it to be above where we are now.
And these are really historic lows.
And our desire at the end of the day is not driven by any target for a write-off rate.
It is to make good economic decisions that will benefit the franchise over the long term.
That's the way we've always mirrored investment decisions.
That's the way we'll continue to make them and I suspect write-off rates are going to obviously settle somewhere between where we are now and that 4.5%.
But to actually peg an exact number will be very dependent on the businesses decisions we're making.
And as you know there's a cyclical impact here and in more robust times this is a lower number.
And in times of economic stress this is a higher number but I think it will obviously be below where we were historically.
Next we go to the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.
Research Division</strong> Two questions.
The first if you could -- as a follow-up to the last question be a little bit more specific on did you reinvest the entire tax credit one; and two as it relates to that a little bit more specific on what you might have spent it on so we can see the one-time nature in that spending.
Secondly have you seen any significant impact from the loss of Continental that you can point to? So we did reinvest the 100% of the tax credit.
It wouldn't be one isolated item.
We knew that we had that resource going into the quarter.
So as we've decided on our investment allocation we took it into consideration.
But you can see in marketing while it's down from the third quarter of last year it is at elevated levels.
And as you look at expenses on the chart maybe in Slide 19 you can see that we're investing in sales force in GNS in new business initiatives.
So it really was part of the allocation of resources across all of those as opposed to just one isolated item.
As it relates to Continental at the end of the day the removal of Continental from our MR program caused some increase in point redemption.
However quite frankly the impact of Continental leaving so far has been less than we would have anticipated.
I point out that even with Continental leaving the program our Platinum Card base in the U.S.
in the third quarter grew.
And we believe that our MR program remains the industry-leading option for high-spending customers.
So there was some customers that moved but less than we expected.
And we continue to have a very strong card base of affluent customers who spend at high levels.
Next we go to the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.
Research Division</strong> I had a question but actually I'll ask a follow-up to that.
I mean if U.S.
Bank lost Northwest held together much better than everyone have thought didn't lose that many customers you lost Continental you're saying you're holding -- the cards holding together you're not losing any customers.
Does that imply the industry is just paying too much for these airline partnerships? Well I think as we know the cost of rewards related to co-brands are higher than our cost of our Membership Rewards program.
We think our Membership Rewards program functions very well and is a program that many customers want because it provides a lot of options.
Instead of being tied to just one redemption option there are many redemption options I think over 100 redemption options which customers find to be very valuable.
But when you look at co-brands despite the higher cost from a rewards perspective of co-brands those customers tend to spend at a higher level and the credit losses on those portfolios tend to be at the low end of the range.
So the economics associated with co-brand products are good and that's why we continue to have those programs and endeavor to make them more attractive.
So while it was a different rewards mix at the end of the day when you look at the economics of a product you need to look at a combination of what does it cost you to acquire the customer what are their spending levels what are their revolve levels what will ultimately be the write-off rates within that group determine the overall economics.
So while rewards costs are higher the economics of those programs are very good.
Research Division</strong> And then just in terms of pricing on cards the environment is worrying to a lot of people in terms of mail volumes increasing balance transfer options are out there.
I guess looking at this quarter's data your yields are up 30 bps USPs are up 20 JPMorgans are up 2 some of the other guys are down but even in the industry average is flat.
I guess any more color you can provide on why the yields were up 30 bps linked quarter? Is there seasonality in there? Is it the higher current 30 roll rates or is pricing competition not as bad this year? I think we had indicated that we thought that yields would eventually migrate back to where we were before the CARD Act.
And I think we've actually seen that now but as you know there are a myriad of factors that come into play.
Credit quality to the extent you have more people in delinquency unhealthy pricing that could drive it up to the extent you have more transactors that can drive it down.
Most of our cards are variably priced.
So when cost of funds go up or down it doesn't have a huge impact.
But as I said before transactors are a decent part of our lending portfolio.
So their interest costs really do matter.
For us as I indicated the pay down rate in the third quarter this year improved compared to the third quarter of last year.
But in fact the pay down rate dropped out a little bit 20 to 30 basis points from the second quarter.
So the fact that the revolve rate changed a little bit I think that had an impact on the higher yield that we saw.
But I think it's going to move around quarter by quarter based on all those factors.
But to the extent it kind of stays in that range of the high 8s to 9% I think that enables us to have good economics related to those products.
And so I wouldn't focus so much on the little moves quarter to quarter but more that we can sustain the appropriate yield over time in terms of assessing the economics of those products.
I guess the other thing that I would note is that while others are doing BTs we are doing very very few in that area because our focus is not bringing on customers who are going to sit with a loan balance.
Our objective is to bring customers who spend and occasionally revolve.
And that is really at the heart of the difference between our business model and a competitor's business model.
We want to generate fees from spending and allow our customers to revolve if they choose to but it's not to bring customers who are going to sit with balances.
We think that will put us in good stead over the long term because we think competitors quite frankly have a challenge.
If you look back in history before the recession loan balances were only growing at about 5%.
And we can certainly see within our portfolio that there has been a separation between the growth in spending and lending products and the growth in loans as customer or consumers have decided to deleverage more.
So that's going to present the challenge for them.
But I think our business model is right for the environment as we go forward.
Next we go to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
Just one other angle on the expense question is that you are suggesting that you will be bringing it down this quarter.
Can you just give us a sense of where you think you can do that in a way that doesn't impact your revenue growth in particular during this heavy spend holiday season.
I'm just wondering where the flexibility is.
All right.
Okay so we haven't said that we're going to bring spending down.
What we've said is that we are going to slow the growth rate in operating expense growth.
Okay so there's a little bit of distinction there.
But I do think that we do see some opportunities.
I mean I think we saw it in the third quarter right? So in the third quarter we saw that as credit is better collections cost came down.
I think we have brought down consulting services.
So that's something that's very discretionary.
We can decide to spend that at a higher level if we think we have an investment that we want to make in a new area or to enhance a product.
But that's very discretionary at the end of the day.
We also continue to be at elevated levels of spending on marketing and promotion.
In this quarter it's about 10% of revenues.
Historically we've been able to generate business momentum with marketing and promotions being about 9% of revenues.
And then as we've discussed we set up Global Services group which is really intended to be very focused on high-quality service by continually improving the efficiency in the way that we do things.
We've set targets for that group that history has spoken about.
We are being very successful at executing against those targets and achieving those goals that we've set for ourselves.
So it's really across each of those types of areas that would enable us to slow the growth of operating expense while still having appropriate levels of resources to continue to drive the growth and the business momentum that we've generated in 2010 and 2011.
Next we go to the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel Nicolaus.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> The recent hoopla on the debit card fees that this may be causing some disruption in the debit card market.
I remember a year ago you started to position your Charge Card as been tried as an alternative [ph] to the debit card.
And I wasn't sure if you had any update on the results of that campaign and when you were thinking that this could be a potential opportunity for American Express to be able to share given what's going on in the debit card market.
I think we've also talked about the fact that Charge Card has some features that are very similar to debit and there are some aspects that are different.
So while it's a pay-in-full product it's not immediate but there are some similarities.
And if you're sufficiently disciplined to pay in full then you can also get reward points and other services that are not available if you utilize the debit product.
So I think a key here is that we've never been in the debit business.
The profit pool in debit was never that large.
With the changes required by Durbin whatever profit pool was there is gone.
So banks are looking to say "How do we look at the overall economics of our relationship with a customer that they have?" And to the extent that relationship is relatively limited then I think they've discussed that they really don't have the ability to provide that service for free without some kind of a cost.
So I think what we're going to see is over time potentially a effort on the banks of -- on the part of banks to either charge for that service or to migrate customers either to Prepaid.
And as you know we have a very strong Prepaid offering.
We issued a new Prepaid product that if you acquire that Prepaid product online there are no fees to acquire it and no fees over time.
So if people move in that direction we have a product that is available.
To the extent that banks push customers more towards credit we think that that would be an opportunity for us to grow our business as well.
So we have to wait and see how this all plays out but it could well be that this turns into more of an opportunity than a risk at the end of the day although the whole script hasn't been written so we'll have to see how that plays out.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> It's fair to say that at this point there's no plans to restart that campaign.
I guess I was also wondering were you happy with that campaign and the results you got? It seems like it is a different product from a consumer standpoint and I wasn't sure if the message you were sending last year really translated to consumers.
A follow-up question would be actually on Serve.
When should we expect Serve if you had any update on it when is it -- the volume metrics or any disclosure around Serve and how that's going -- that it starts? Okay.
So I don't think we ever really had a campaign to say that the Charge Card is the equivalent of a debit product.
I think in different conversations with investors we probably talked about the fact that there are some aspects of the product that are similar but the fact that it's a payment in full when you receive the statement I would say it's more fundamentally a different product.
And the Charge Card product is maybe really targeted at different set of consumers than consumers who are using the debit product.
Debit products I think are probably more for smaller ticket item for people who have more limited resources and are trying to manage them very carefully.
As you know our Charge Card products are really targeted at more affluent customers.
They have fees attached to them but they also have substantial benefits associated with them.
And we have on the other hand had a campaign to grow Charge Card over the last year and a half and we have been really very successful at acquiring high-spending cardmembers and growing cards.
And you could also see the Charge Card spend in this quarter grew by 14% compared to the prior period.
So we're being successful at acquiring cards and having our customers grow their spending on those cards.
So in terms of Serve your second question what we have been targeting over this year 2011 is to first launch Serve which we did in March.
You remember that we acquired Revolution Money in January of 2010.
From early 2010 through March of this year we looked at building on the platform in building the capabilities.
The launch that we did in March is really kind of Serve 1.0.
We're going to look to enhance that platform and we've been focused on building the capabilities on that platform throughout 2011.
The metrics that we put out there that we wanted to accomplish in 2011 was really to enter into a number of partnerships where we can actually drive customers in the future to the Serve platform.
So this year we announced the partnership with Verizon that integrates Serve into their pay-by-phone service and they're embedding Serve in new Verizon phones.
We also announced the partnership with Sprint to embed Serve into the Sprint Zone.
So we've signed also some agreements with AOL as well.
So we are kind of hitting in our mind our objectives for this year to improve the platform and to sign new partnerships that will enable us to bring customers on to our network and to have Serve product.
So I think for this year those are the guideposts that I would look to for success.
As we look to 2012 I think then we're going to look to actually seeing how successful we are actually bringing customers onto a Serve product and onto our network.
So those are the guideposts that we are looking at in terms of success.
Next we go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> Maybe I could just follow up on that rewards cost question asked previously.
Despite my rough math I think the redemption rate moved up to about 93% and I guess I was just wondering like how much higher can it go given the current trends? And secondarily just to the extent that you do need to take that redemption rate assumption up you guys still feel comfortable that you could hit your historical kind of efficiency ratio targets as shown on Slide 20 in that scenario.
And then maybe just a second question to that is just reserve coverage.
And obviously you had very strong coverage levels right now.
What is the normal level if we head into next year? Okay.
So on the first question you remember that in last quarter we indicated that we were at 92% related to active customers.
And that in the first quarter we actually rounded up to 92% and we said we had growth in the ultimate redemption rate and that we kind of round it down to 92%.
So in this quarter we again had growth in the ultimate redemption rate but we're still rounding down to 92%.
So it grew but still rounds down to 92%.
So we're not at 93% yet.
Now how high can it go? That's difficult to forecast.
It will be dependent on the behaviors of customers in the future.
So certainly customers who have a trend [ph from their program already on average have tried it at a rate that's below 92%.
But we look at the behaviors of the active customers.
And then we draw our curves into the future in terms of what we think the ultimate redemption rate will be.
So the 92% represents those behaviors to date.
As customers become more engaged it will potentially drive that rate up.
Will it ever get to 100%? I think that's probably unlikely.
But based on customer behaviors it certainly could go above the rates that we are at today.
So the question about how does it fit into the efficiency ratio so we can look at efficiency ratio but I think we need to look at really all expenses including provision.
So I think that we do need marketing and promotion over time on average and over time to kind of be 9% of revenues.
On the other hand because write-off rates are going to be lower than historic levels then I think that's going to allow the efficiency ratio to probably be a little higher than it may have been prerecession.
But we're going to need to balance how we decide to utilize our resources between Rewards and operating expense over time.
And that's a judgment we'll make in the normal course of business in terms of how we decide what to allocate to marketing what to allocate to Rewards what to allocate to other business initiatives to build the capabilities.
And that's a map and planning that we are doing now have always done and will do in the future.
And we believe that even with higher Rewards cost that we can continue to achieve our current financial objectives of revenue growth of 8% plus and 12% to 15% EPS growth and an ROE of 25% plus.
So even with the high Rewards cost we'll be -- -- had planned stay with our current financial targets.
So I think...
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> And the reserve coverage? Okay reserve coverage.
I think reserve coverage is obviously lower than it was a year ago or earlier this year.
As credit improves I would expect those ratios to gradually come down.
This is an uncertain environment and so we're cautious as we release reserves.
But to the extent we get to a point where there's less uncertainty then I think you could potentially see lower reserve coverage than we have at the moment but that will be driven by the fact and circumstances at the time.
Next we go to Ken Bruce with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail or decompose the corporate incentive payments and partnership payments that was in the contra revenues item this quarter.
If there was one-time items size it up in any way for me? So I don't think there were any one-time items.
I think we interact with our corporate customers and particularly our larger corporate customers and we provide them incentives to do business with us.
And certainly to the extent that their volumes increase above certain threshold levels we provide incentives related to that as well.
So these incentives are all around driving higher spend levels at the end of the day.
So each quarter we have new signings.
And those new signings are reflected in the results.
But again even with these higher incentives that we're paying to corporate customers and partners the economics around these agreements are very good.
And we make that evaluation in terms of the returns that we're achieving and ensuring that they achieve our return thresholds.
So I don't have more specifics than that but these are good economic decisions that enable us to both grow the business and achieve our financial targets that we just discussed a moment ago.
So I would think about these probably not differently than I think about Rewards.
At the end of the day you want to grow volumes and achieve the right economic returns and these agreements are enabling us to do that.
So let me just have this be the last question.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Can I have a follow-up? Okay go ahead.
Well one follow-up and then one last question.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And it will be a 2-part follow-up.
On the discount rate you've in the past guided to a few basis point erosion per year.
I think as you pointed out in your earlier comments much of that was a mix change issue on a year-over-year basis in the quarter.
I'm wondering is there an order of magnitude that you could provide in terms of the net discount rate which would include the contra revenue items as we think about forecasting? And then as a second part how do you think about the overall level of transactors in your overall lending book? I think you pointed out it had grown from 16% to 29%.
Based on the number or the percentage of mail drops where do you think that ultimately gets to? Okay.
So on the first question in terms of the discount rate to the extent we are successful and continuing to drive into new categories or are able to create greater engagement of existing customers into new categories they will in all likelihood drive the average discount rate down by 2 or 3 basis points a year.
Over the last 3 or 4 years it's only been about 1 basis point as we've been successful or we're historically successful at increasing price in certain categories where it was warranted based on the value that we bring.
There are less of those opportunities at the moment.
And that's why I think we're seeing the 2% lower discount rate -- 2 basis points lower discount rate.
But again the economics are good here.
It's part of our strategy.
This is something that we are driving as opposed to just happening to us at the end of the day.
I actually have not really thought about where it might go net of incentives.
It's not something that we have done.
So that's not a statistics that I thought about quite frankly.
The other thing is that as you do the calculation where you're just taking discount revenue divided by billings you need to be mindful of GNS.
So GNS is a terrific success story.
It is driving additional business.
It's increasing relevance of our network around the world.
But as you know in GNS we get a percentage of the discount rates and not the full 2.5.
That's impacting that calculation.
It's probably the biggest impact on that calculation.
But the economics of the GNS business are very good.
As you know we don't have credit risk and has very good returns on equity.
So we shouldn't think about that ratio going down as a negative.
It's actually again driven by our business strategy.
And we are being successful.
In GNS as you know we've had growth in Billed business of over 20% for the last 8 quarters.
Now in terms of transactors you're right.
Back in the second quarter of '08 transactors only represented 16% and that is now up to 29%.
I think that is a combination of our strategy which we are focused on premium lending.
And I think that would cause that number to go up over time.
On the other hand another very big factor is just customer behavior where customers have decided to delever.
Now whether customers continue to be in that load over the long-term or whether over time they are more willing to take on additional revolving credit.
That will drive that number as well.
So I think it will be both of those factors over time that drive where that percentages go.
Again the important thing is that we have good economics whether it's a customer who is spending and revolving or a customer who is simply a transactor.
So now I'll take one last question.
Okay? So if we have no further questions I thank everybody for being on the call.
Thank you very much.
Okay that's a wrap.

Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome the American Express Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release.
[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I'll now turn the conference over to your host Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you.
Welcome and thanks for joining us for today's discussion.
The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the fourth quarter 2011 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dan completes his remarks we will move to Q&amp;A.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay thanks Rick.
So we will start on Slide 2 the Fourth Quarter Summary of Financial Performance.
Total revenues net of interest expense were $7.7 billion 7% growth on both a reported and FX basis.
That compares to the third quarter where we had 9% growth reported and 6% FX adjusted.
So down 200 basis points on a reported basis but up 100 basis points on an FX-adjusted basis.
Net income is $1.2 billion EPS is $1.01.
That is up 15%.
You might remember that in the fourth quarter of last year we had a reengineering charge which was $74 million after tax.
In the fourth quarter of this year we also have reengineering and that's $32 million on an after-tax basis.
So if you were to back those out EPS growth would be 11%.
So return on equity was strong at 28%.
You can see that our shares outstanding have decreased compared to last year and that reflects our share buyback program.
Moving to Slide 3.
Now this is a full year slide for 2011 and total revenues net of interest expense was $30 billion.
That's up 7% on an FX-adjusted basis.
That's very favorable compared to most of the other issuing competitors.
EPS was $4.09 up 22%.
So that's strong performance well above our EPS target of 12% to 15% growth.
Moving to Slide 4 which is back to the fourth quarter and these are our metrics.
Billed business was $219 million that's a record level of billed business for us.
The growth was 11% both on a reported and FX basis.
So that compares to 16% reported growth and 13% FX growth in the third quarter so a slight decline in billed business growth from the third quarter which is what we've seen across the industry.
So cards-in-force are at $97 million GNS cards grew at 18% and proprietary cards grew at 2% so in total 7% growth.
Average basic cardmember spending grew 8%.
So we continue to have a high level of customer engagement.
Loan growth was 3% generally better than the industry.
And travel sales growing at 5% reflect both growth in our Corporate and Consumer Travel businesses.
We move to Slide 5 again this is full year metrics.
So we had billed business growth of $222 billion (sic) [$822 billion].
That's growth of 13% on an FX-adjusted basis and this will result in us gaining share again in 2011.
If you look at average cardmember spend for the year on FX-adjusted basis it was 11%.
So again high level of cardmember engagement.
We move to Slide 6.
This is Billed Business Growth by Region.
So if you look at the yellow line which is Latin America and Canada growth was 13% down 100 basis points from the third quarter.
The dark blue line is the U.S.
and the green line is Asia and they are both down about 200 basis points compared to the third quarter.
So these 3 regions held up reasonably well.
If you look at the lowest line which is the light blue line that's Europe and there we had a decrease to 4% from the 8% growth we had in the third quarter.
So the U.K.
Germany and France all had growth in the mid-single digits.
Italy actually had a slight decline.
If we move to Slide 7 so this is Billed Business Growth by Segment so total billed business growth is the purple line.
And you can see that on an FX-adjusted basis it decreased from 13% in the third quarter to 11% in the fourth quarter.
GNS is the yellow line with circles and that decreased from 23% growth to 17% growth.
It's due in part to a decline in Europe but it's primarily due to the U.S.
where Macy's is now in the numbers for our full year.
GCS or Global Corporate Services the green triangles declined from 14% to 11% growth.
And the decline is slightly higher in Europe but it's broad based globally.
USCS which is the blue diamonds is down only 100 basis points from 12% to 11%.
And ICS International Consumer the light blue squares moved from 9% to 6% growth primarily due to Asia and Europe.
Next we move to Slide 8.
So this is comparing lending billed business compared to managed loan growth.
So loan balances continue to grow up 3% compared to a year ago but it grows at a much slower rate than the growth rate of spending on lending products as you can see from the chart.
This reflects that consumers continue to be cautious about taking on credit card loans and a change in our strategy to focus on premium lending.
Transactors continue to be a larger percentage of our loan book and the lending trust pay down rate in December was 30%.
Moving to Slide 9 Net Interest Yield.
Now historically we have just shown the U.S.
yield but here we're also showing the yield for International Card.
So international loans represent 14% of loans as of December 31 2011.
Yields are in line with our previous guidance of yields being in the high 8% to 9% range.
You can see that the U.S.
yield is now reasonably stable.
In international we're seeing the impact of our premium lending strategy as we see a decline in revolve rates more transactors and a change in bucket mix due to improved credit.
Going forward yields will continue to be influenced by credit quality the percentage of the portfolio that is revolving and cost of funds.
Moving to Slide 10 Revenue Performance.
Discount revenue reflects 11% growth in billed business a slightly lower discount rate 1 basis point lower than last year the impact of the GNS billed business and higher contra revenues including partner payments and this brings the growth with discount revenue to 8%.
Card fees grew in line with the growth in proprietary cards-in-force 2%.
Travel commissions and fees are up 9% reflecting higher travel sales and higher supplier revenues.
Other commissions and fees include revenues from Loyalty Partner which was purchased in March of 2011.
Offset by an accrual for late fees the company expects to refund to certain charge card accounts.
Other revenues increased 20% reflecting higher GNS partner royalty revenues and a contractual payment from a GNS partner.
Net interest income is lower by 1%.
In the U.S.
it was up 2% with loan growth of 4% up to $53.7 billion with yield acquiring 20 basis points compared to last year.
International was down 10% loans decreased $400 million to $8.9 billion and yields declined 140 basis points for the reasons I described a minute ago.
All in we had revenue growth of 7% in the fourth quarter compared to 6% FX growth in the third quarter.
Not at our 8% target but given the environment good performance.
Moving to Slide 11 Provision for Loans.
Charge card provision was $237 million compared to $183 million last year.
The write-off rate is up slightly as expected as we grow the charge card business and as a result accounts receivables are up accordingly.
Here credit metrics continue to be at historic lows.
The loan provision was $149 million compared to $37 million last year.
So the reserve release this quarter was $300 million.
That's $400 million less than last year.
So that change would push up provision increase it.
However the write-off rate this quarter was 2.3% compared to a write-off rate of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.
So the write-off dollars in this quarter were $400 million $300 million less than last year.
So the lower reserve release pushed it up by $400 million lower write-off dollars pushed it down $300 million so a net increase of about $100 million.
Again here the credit metrics continue to be at historic lows.
Next is Slide 12 which is Charge Card Credit Performance.
So the write-off rates in the charge card portfolio have increased slightly both sequentially and compared to last year but remained at historical lows.
The slight increase in charge card metrics align with the company's charge card strategic objectives for growing and expanding the business.
Slide 13 Lending Write-off Rate.
So lending write-off rates continue to improve.
These are also at historic lows.
And these are the best write-off rates in the industry and they reflect our high-quality risk capabilities our affluent customer base and our focus on premium lending.
Moving to Slide 14 so this is Lending 30 Days Past Due.
In the U.S.
you can see that the past due percentage are stabilizing which is what you'd expect at some point.
International continues to improve and again these are industry-leading metrics.
If we move to Slide 15 so this chart is helpful as we look forward.
On the right side we see bankruptcies continue to be lower than last year.
I would remind you that about 2/3 of the bankruptcies are already written off when we are notified.
Now the upper left-hand green triangles are the accounts that are rolling from current to 30 days past due.
So the green triangles represent May June and July and they would write off in 5 months later if they continue to be delinquent or they'd write off in the fourth quarter of 2011.
So looking at that upper left-hand chart if you look at the next 3 blue triangles they are slightly higher than the green triangles.
So if the 30-day past due to write-off rate which is the bottom chart remain constant then you'd expect the first quarter 2012 write-off rate would be either flat or up a tick.
I'll also remind you that bankruptcies and recoveries affect the write-off rate.
You can see the U.S.
delinquencies are stabilizing.
Now as I've mentioned in prior quarters our objective is not to manage our business in order to minimize write-offs.
Going forward we will continue to balance our risk profile with the company's strategic growth objectives and over time we do not expect the loss rate to stay at these historic low levels.
Moving to Slide 16.
Here you can see on the chart across the top are the lending reserve releases by quarter.
Then the light blue bars are the write-off dollar amounts in each quarter and the dark bar is the provision so basically the write-off dollars less the reserve releases.
You can see the write-off dollar the light blue bars are decreasing as write-offs have come down.
Also reserve releases are decreasing as the past due rate of improvement slows.
So the reserve release these reserve releases should diminish as we go forward.
Slide 17 or our Lending Reserve Coverage.
You can see that the credit metrics continue to improve.
Reserves as a percentage of loans and reserves as a percentage of past dues have come down both in the U.S.
and worldwide.
Although we released $300 million of reserves in the quarter coverage remains at appropriate levels.
Moving to Slide 18 so this is Expense Performance.
So total expenses increased 1% or decreased 2% if you adjust for the MasterCard settlement payment that we received in 2010 but not in the fourth quarter of 2011.
And that compares to 10% FX adjusted growth in the third quarter.
So looking at marketing and promotion this decreased to 12% from the high levels of spending that we had in the fourth quarter of 2010.
But marketing is still 7% of revenues which are the historic levels that we have been at and reflect an appropriate level of investment to drive business growth.
Rewards increased 10% in line with spending on rewards products.
There was a slight increase in Membership Rewards ultimate redemption rate estimate in both the fourth quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2010 so it had no effect on the growth rate of rewards expense in the fourth quarter of this year unlike the second and third quarter when higher ultimate redemption rate growth caused high growth rates on the rewards line.
Operating expense had a 0 growth.
It actually decreased by 4% if you adjust for the MasterCard settlement.
And this compares with 9% FX-adjusted growth in the third quarter.
We provided guidance that we would slow growth in operating expense as we exited 2011 and we have.
This demonstrates our ability to control operating expenses.
So let me give you a little bit more detail on operating expenses on Slide 19.
So salaries and benefits are down 2%.
So I remind you in the fourth quarter of 2010 we had severance costs related to reengineering initiatives of $113 million compared to severance cost in the fourth quarter of this year of $26 million.
If we excluded both these items we'd have a growth rate of 4% approximately what you'd expect.
Professional services is 6% lower reflecting lower consulting fees and lower technology expenses the type of items that we can flex up and down.
Occupancy increased 9% and includes costs associated with Loyalty Partners as well as lease termination costs associated with the company's reengineering.
Adjusted Other Net is adjusted to exclude Visa/MasterCard.
So here our interest rate hedges are functioning exactly as intended.
However accounting rules require us to mark the hedges.
So there's no economics here and over the life of the hedge the marks will equal 0.
But in this period we had a benefit compared to last year.
And we had a litigation-related reserve release and these 2 items really create the variance compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
So if we move to Slide 20 this is year-over-year operating expense and this is a view of operating expense over the past 8 quarters.
You can see the increase in operating expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 which is in the middle of the chart at $3.2 billion.
So this was driven by some onetime costs including the severance-related reengineering initiatives and some higher incentive compensation but it also included increases in our ongoing investments.
You can see that the quarters in 2011 have been in $3 billion to $3.1 billion range.
This reflects higher levels of investments than we had in 2010 including investments in internal sales force initiatives related to the digitization of our business greater third-party merchant sales force costs related to Loyalty Partners new business initiatives including Serve and technology development expenditures all designed to drive business growth.
We are at an investment level that enables us to drive business growth and at the same time we are continuing to implement our plan to contain operating expenses as we head into 2012.
Now when you think about 2012 you should also be mindful that the first quarter of 2011 was the low point for operating expenses in 2011 as you can see on the chart.
So now I'll move to Slide 21.
So this is expenses and the flexibility over time.
Adjusted expenses are all expenses excluding provision as well as the Visa and MasterCard settlement payments.
Now we recognize that we are currently at elevated levels.
Over time we expect this ratio to migrate back toward historical levels in 2 ways.
First through revenue growth and our plan to contain operating expenses as we head into 2012.
You can see that we have started to make progress in the fourth quarter of this year.
Slide 22 our Capital Ratios.
You can see that Tier 1 common capital ratio remains at 12.3%.
We generated approximately $700 million of capital net through net income plus employee plans less our dividend and our share repurchases while the risk-weighted assets have increased due to seasonal growth in loans and accounts receivable.
Let me point out that year-over-year the Tier 1 common ratio has increased from 11.1% at the end of last year to 12.3% at the end of 2011.
So we continue to have strong capital ratios.
Looking at Slide 23 so this chart provides history on share repurchases.
For the full year 2011 we returned 56% of capital generated to shareholders.
We only repurchased $350 million in the fourth quarter as the request we made in our CCAR filing with the Fed last January was a total repurchase for 2011 of $2.3 billion.
Since acquisitions in 2011 were less than we planned and repurchases were capped at $2.3 billion our Tier 1 common ratio increased from 11.1% last year to 12.3% at the end of 2011.
We were mindful of this when we made our CCAR submission this year on January 9 and endeavored to create more flexibility.
Moving to Slide 24 so this is our liquidity snapshot.
We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the 12 months of funding maturities over the next 12 months.
So we hold $18 billion in excess cash and securities and the next 12 months of maturities is $14 billion.
Slide 25 this is retail deposits.
So we raised $4.8 billion in deposits in the quarter in part to fund seasonal needs in part to replace maturing long-term debt.
Direct deposits increased by $1.4 billion in the quarter and over the course of 2011 we raised 6.7 indirect deposits.
As we've discussed deposits provide greater degrees of funding diversity for us.
Page 26 is some history on our ABS and unsecured debt issuances over the past 3 years and an estimate of the range of potential issuances in 2012.
We plan to continue to access the ABS and unsecured debt markets in addition to raising deposits as part of having a broad funding diversity.
So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.
Results in the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters as well as the realization of a planned slowdown in the growth of operating expenses.
Spending growth remains strong and we continue to grow well above the average rate of our large issuing competitors despite difficult prior year comparisons and a challenging global economic environment.
Certain regions internationally did show slowing growth especially in Europe where growth slowed to 4% though all regions continue to grow and overall buildings held up well in reaching our new record high.
We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year.
Lending loss rates continue to improve.
Loss rates in both the U.S.
and international lending portfolios have reached all-time lows.
Despite the continued improvement provision expense did increase as reserve releases were lower this year and the prior year.
Our strong billings growth coupled with higher other noninterest revenues drove solid revenue growth.
Our revenue growth which reflects the benefits of our spend-centric model stands in contrast to many other issuers who are still facing year-over-year revenue declines.
In the fourth quarter strong revenue growth was paired with significant reductions in the total expense growth rate to generate strong earnings.
Despite the improvement in expense growth we are still investing in the business and these investments are driving higher average spend and growth in the card base while enabling us to build capabilities for the future.
We feel very good about the recent performance but acknowledge that the global economic environment remains uncertain.
Looking ahead we recognize that the year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult and that we will not have the benefit of the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds and significant credit reserve releases.
But we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead.
We are continuing to implement our plan to contain operating expenses as we head into 2012.
And in the fourth quarter we saw a clear evidence of our ability to do that.
Going forward we will continue to monitor spend trends around the world but we are very pleased with our results.
2011 was a great year for American Express as we achieved record billing levels and record earnings while facing the highly competitive environment and challenging economic backdrop.
So thanks for listening and we're now ready for questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> Obviously a lot of what's going on in terms of spend is just a function of tougher and tougher year-over-year comps.
But Dan historically one of the data points that you provided periodically was a stratification of spending trends by what you called wallet size or annual spend.
Is there anything there that you can point to right now in terms of what's going on? Is there any difference between the high end and the low end at this point? So that's usually the type of information we provide at one of our semiannual conferences and don't provide it on a recurring basis.
I guess what I would say is what we saw in the quarter where our growth was generally higher than most of the other competitors is a reflection of our business model and we're only reaping the benefits of the investments that we've made over the past couple of years.
While the growth rate did decline from the third quarter I think we've seen that really across the industry.
And the decline really was pretty spread out across the globe and really across most of our businesses.
So it's kind of the -- what we're seeing I think is really a reflection of what's taking place in the economy.
But at this point we don't have other information to share in terms of changes that may be taking -- by different wallet size.
As you know when we had this decrease or recession you saw the steepest reduction in people who had the highest spend because they had the greatest amount of discretionary spending.
But we've seen those customers bounce back very nicely over the last 2 years and they continue to have very high levels of engagement as you can see by the increases in the average spend of our cardmembers.
Research Division</strong> I'll cross my fingers that you guys put that out at investor day.
And our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay.
Just a touch additionally on the spend trends.
Just wondering like what was the trend that was seen during the quarter? Was it weaker throughout the quarter or did it get weaker during the quarter? And then if there's any updates on the first couple of weeks in January.
I would say it was pretty even over the course of the quarter kind of month by month.
So it wasn't a situation where December was notably different than the spending growth rate for the quarter.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> Sure.
And any updates on what we've seen month-to-date in January? Not at this point.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> I guess another question is with regards to your longer-term targets and -- what are your thoughts about that for 2012 in an environment where it continues to remain slow growth economic environment? Yes what we'll see actually next year as you indicated in your question will be dependent on where the economy goes.
And we fully recognize that we have had very strong growth over the last 2 years so the comparables will be more difficult and there are some benefits that are not going to reoccur.
As we think about this we want to make good smart investment decisions that are going to drive the growth of the business over the long term.
And as we think about all of our targets we think about them as on average and over time targets.
We've always kind of addressed it that way and we'll continue to do the same as we go forward.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> Sure.
And then final question on the international yield side do you think that the yields will remain kind of at the fourth quarter levels or will it continue to decline from here? Yes so I think the change in yields that we've seen in international are a part of the focus on premium lending that we put in place.
And that's what's really driving the yields down.
To us whether the yields in international stay exactly where they are or modulate from there the important thing is one of the overall economics of the product focusing both on the spend that they have the loan balance that they have as well as the yield.
In the U.S.
we've kind of given guidance that we expect it to be kind of in this high 8% to 9% range and you could see that we've stabilized in the U.S.
at that level.
We will go next to Craig Maurer with CLSA.
Research Division</strong> Question on Membership Rewards costs.
We saw that actually grow a bit slower than the U.S.
billed business growth rate.
Just some thoughts there and how we should expect that to trend as I'm modeling that to grow at a similar rate to the U.S.
billed business growth.
And secondly when we think about your payout ratio what's the company's -- what's your thought process on dividend versus buyback at this point? So in MR we had growth on the expense line of 10% which is fairly in line with the growth that we see in spending.
And most of our products have a report -- a reward component related to it.
In any given quarter it's also impacted by what the weighted average cost per point is and a number of other factors.
So to the extent rewards is a couple of percentages growth is a couple of percentages above or below I would consider that to be in line with spending growth.
So in the absence of an acceleration in redemptions which lead to higher growth in the ultimate redemption rate we would expect that rewards expense would grow generally in line with spending.
Now as it relates to dividends payout so we think about dividends as trying to over time maintain the kind of the yield or the payout ratio of dividends compared to earnings that we've historically have.
So I would expect as earnings go up we would try to keep that same type of payout ratio going forward not radically change dividends either up or down.
And to the extent we then generate capital that is either dividend-ed out or used to support growth in our balance sheet to maintain our capital ratios or to support acquisitions we would use that in terms of share buybacks.
We've said dimensionally we would expect about 50% to be retained in the business of earnings and 50% to be returned to shareholders but that's very dependent on the number of acquisitions that are out there that we think are economical and will help us drive our business strategy.
So this time if we saw more acquisitions we thought worthwhile the payout could be a little lower than that.
And to the extent we don't see acquisitions that we decide to make then the payout ratio in a given year would be higher than that.
So no change really in the policy that we've articulated over the past year.
Your next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Research Division</strong> Just as we think about 2012 earnings and your on average over time the earnings forecast and our estimate are relatively flat with 2011.
And I think at one point you had said or American Express had said maybe 2010 was a reasonable period to think about as kind of a base year for the 12% to 15% target earnings growth.
Is that still true? I mean just the expectations currently are for relatively little earnings growth as you don't have the reserve releases and you don't have the MasterCard/Visa payments and you manage your expenses in a relatively slower growth than the global environment.
So as you'd expect I'm not going to forecast next year's EPS but you're absolutely right.
What we have said is 2010 is a good base year and off of that on average and over time we would look to achieve the financial targets that we have out there in terms of 8% revenue growth and 12% to 15% EPS growth.
So 2010 is the base year and we haven't modified our targets at all.
Obviously we hit 22% growth in this year and it's an example of when we are above that range.
Research Division</strong> Tax rate for 2012 any thoughts on tax rate? So our tax rate is generally 30% to 32%.
So in the absence of benefits either from planning or from the resolution of audits I would expect it to be in that same range.
Research Division</strong> And then the last question.
Just on some of your initiatives like the Prepaid with Target the Serve I saw an interesting investment you made yesterday.
Can you give any update on how's the Prepaid Target? How's that product looking? Loyalty Partners is something you guys certainly are pushing pretty hard.
I'd love some update on some of these products.
So there are 3 different topics.
So Prepaid we think is an expanding market.
We are investing in Prepaid.
We think it has very good growth rates over time and attractive economics for us.
So that is an area that we are focused as a growth area.
Target is just one example of some of the new products that we have out there.
We're focused both in the U.S.
and really globally for Prepaid.
So we're very pleased with how the Prepaid business is growing.
In terms of the announcement we made yesterday.
Basically we've entered into an operating agreement with a company in China named Lianlian.
Basically we are going to license our Serve platform which will be really what drives a digital wallet that they want to develop.
As we all know China is a very large market.
It provides an opportunity for us to participate there.
And we also made a equity investment in Lianlian Pay Inc.
of $125 million.
So it's very much in line with our strategy and we're pleased with that agreement and investment.
In terms of Loyalty Partner which is the acquisition that we closed in March of 2011 we think we -- and it continues to have good growth prospects which is the reason that we acquired it and we're in the process of doing the work necessary to execute against our strategy.
So I think each of those are moving in line with the plans that we've set out for each of the respective businesses.
And we have a question from Mark DeVries with Barclays Capital.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to ask about the rewards expense in a slightly different way.
By our calculation rewards as a percentage of proprietary billed business was down pretty significantly Q-over-Q to about 78 basis points from 88 basis points last quarter.
And I think you also indicated there was at least a slight increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the quarter so presumably that included at least a little bit of a reserve adjustment.
Is that 78 basis point level assuming no material change in redemption rates from here a reasonable run rate going forward? So certainly you could kind of look at it on a basis points to billings basis.
We have invested in making Membership Rewards a highly attractive program which we think it is.
We think it's terrific if customers increased the amount of redemptions they make because there's a clear link between cardmembers who do redemptions and growth in their spending as we go forward.
So improving the program and increasing engagement which is reflected in redemptions.
But that ultimately impacts our estimate of the ultimate redemption rate.
We think it's a good thing for the franchise.
In this quarter it so happened that that increase which is a slight increase was similar to the fourth quarter of last year.
If in fact as we go forward that ticks up the ultimate redemption rate we would actually view that as a positive thing long term for the franchise.
As you saw in the second and third quarter if it moves up quite a bit compared to the prior year then you get high growth rates on this line.
However if the ultimate redemption rate stayed at the current level with modest increases which was similar year-to-year then I think you have this relationship of rewards to billings continue into the future.
Research Division</strong> And understanding that you're not going to rigidly managed to that 8% long-term revenue growth target year-to-year that said in an environment where organic growth may be challenged because of the economy does that create any greater sense of urgency for you to deploy some of those retained earnings and investments that may generate more immediate revenue benefit than kind of benefits that are further out? Okay.
I think there's a tremendous focus on revenue growth in our industry.
Certainly what happened with the economy which is uncertain will have a bearing on whether we achieve the 8%.
But I think it's important to remember that our business model is very different than many of our issuing competitors.
They are very dependent on loan growth which is particularly challenged.
Net interest only represents about 15% or only represented about 15% of our revenues in this period.
So to the extent we're successful with our business strategies and drive spending then I think we're going to be in a better position than many of our competitors in terms of achieving revenue growth as we go forward.
But in terms of how we allocate our investments certainly as we've said in the past we look to allocate investments to things that will give a short-term benefit some to the medium term and some to the long term.
Certainly in periods where things are more robust you may tend to allocate more to the long term.
And if it's a more challenging environment you may do more focus on the piece that has short-term benefits.
But we would never skew completely away from investing in medium to long term because we really do look at achieving results on average and over time and that we're in the midst of investing in some new businesses that we think are -- have a lot of potential to them.
So we would not detract from continuing to invest in those new businesses as we go forward.
But certainly we can modulate in terms of the amount we allocate into the short medium and long-term buckets.
We will go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just a question and a follow-up from earlier on the capital front.
So you're clearly still well above the targets that you had laid out several quarters back.
And I think you returned 56% of capital this year which is above the 50%.
But should we not see any acquisitions materialize in the near term? Could there be the expectation that you could go above the 50% -- the 50% to 60% in the near term in terms of capital returns? If you think about the amount of capital that we generate which is substantial we have a fair amount of capital that we have discretion in terms of how we actually use it.
So we generated earnings in the year of nearly $5 billion.
So to the extent we're allocating 50% to really build the business because consumers are cautious about taking on additional loans.
The growth in the balance sheet hasn't been that significant so the amount of capital that's actually required to support that is $500 million or $600 million last year.
So it leaves a lot of capacity for acquisitions.
And if we find good acquisitions that can help us achieve our business strategies we're going to go and make those as long as the price and the economics are reasonable.
And if we found more than $1.9 billion we go higher.
On the other hand if we don't see good acquisitions we would be inclined actually to return that capital to shareholders if we're not going to use it in the very near term.
That's always been our philosophy and will continue to be our philosophy.
But if we see good acquisitions we will seize on them.
If not we'll return the capital to shareholders.
Research Division</strong> Okay and I guess -- well it's a relatively smaller part of the billed business.
Can you just give us maybe a little bit more of a sense of what you're actually seeing out of your customer base in Europe? I mean I think you referenced something like you saw growth in the U.K.
Germany and France and that there was declines.
Any further clarity you could give just on what you're seeing or what your expectations are for that? Okay.
So let me just add 1 or 2 more sentences to my prior answer as related to capital.
So what I just described is the capital philosophy that we have but obviously what we actually do would be dependent on the Fed approving the plan that we submitted to them on January 9.
So I would just put that as a modifier to the comments I made a minute ago.
As it relates to Europe I mean we saw 8% growth in the third quarter 4% growth this quarter.
The countries certainly the U.K.
and Germany and France the companies that are -- the countries that are stronger there we've seen declines from previous quarters in terms of growth rate but still we're seeing growth in the mid-single digits which is pretty good.
And as you'd expect in the countries that are more impacted we're seeing less growth or actually a slight decline which is what we saw in Italy.
So beyond that I don't have any other additional color to add but I think that will give you a sense.
And what you'd expect is exactly is what we're seeing: more impact on the countries that are under greater economic stress in terms of their funding.
We will move on to Marc Lombardo with Meredith Whitney.
Just wanted to see kind of following up on Ryan's question.
Are you able to breakout the percent that Europe represented in billed business either for 4Q or for 2011? In terms of what percent of billed business? So in 2010 it was 12%.
So if you look across the year based on the information that we provided to you Europe has actually grown at a slower rate than the rest of the world.
So it could be still 12% or slightly less than that but I would say in that neighborhood.
Probably a little less than what we had last year when it represented 12% of billings.
Okay great.
And then domestically are you noticing that cardmembers are trading down still? Trading down in terms of the average ticket price? Correct.
So I don't think we -- I'm not aware that there's been any notable change in average ticket price.
The positive is in the U.S.
billings have really held up well.
Growth has been 11% compared to 12% last quarter.
And it's pretty broad-based both in consumers small business and corporate spending.
So -- and as I said before the average spend of our customers continues to grow very nicely showing high levels of engagement on their part.
Your next question is from Chris Brendler with Stifel Nicolaus.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I don't know if you addressed this or not I have been multitasking here but could you comment on [indiscernible] any update on the Department of Justice case? I believe at that time in October of 2010 you'd set it around a 2-year window for some movement in that case.
Is there any timeline that we should be aware of there? And then secondarily is there any thoughts you can give us relative to your rules on surcharging and whether or not Visa and MasterCard are rolling back their rules on surcharging a lot [indiscernible] in the U.S.
could impact your business model? So there's no real update on the DoJ case.
The first time that we'll have anything new would be there is a schedule to complete discovery I think in the first quarter of 2013.
So right now this discovery is taking place and that'll take place over the course of the next year.
So no real update in those terms.
In terms of surcharging I think there's nothing new on our part in terms of any changes to our policies in that regard.
And the place we have seen surcharging to the greatest degree which is a little bit of an old story now is Australia.
Certainly it had an impact on us initially when it took place a couple of years ago but we continue to evolve our business strategy there and have had very healthy growth rates in the market and are doing well.
So nothing really to update that's new as it relates to surcharging.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Is there any relationship between the 2? The DoJ kind of seem as a matter of fact seem to be okay with surcharging.
It's more about allowing discounting.
Is it possible you could allude [ph] to the DoJ case to retain the ability to not allow merchants to surcharge in the U.S.? So I think that case is primarily whether merchants could steer from one credit card company to another credit card company.
I think it's the basis of the primary point in the suit.
As we've said before we have an advantage on the discount-rate basis compared to Visa and MasterCard but there's only a certain limited amount of economics there.
So it could be a real question in my mind of whether there's enough economics to actually cause somebody to switch from one credit card product to another credit card product given the potential cost that could be involved in that.
But it's really a case focused on whether merchants can steer from one credit card to another.
Basically within Durbin they're allowed to steer from credit cards to debit but that case is about credit card to credit card.
And merchants have always had the ability and the right to give discounts based on payments for cash.
Your next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore.
Research Division</strong> Dan your net interest income as a proportion of total revenues has been coming down 15% this quarter.
I think it was historically in the sort of 20% range.
Should we expect that trend to continue the decline in net interest income as loan growth is less of a focus and you continue to look at higher end transactors? Yes I think it's going to be totally dependent on the behaviors of our customers.
If you look at the paydown rates in the lending trust last month or even a year ago they are kind of all in that 30% range up a little bit down a little bit.
So we had gone through a period where it was increasing quite a bit.
It seems to have stabilized here some.
So it depends on whether that continues.
We are focused on premium lending but it certainly doesn't mean that our customers aren't going to evolve periodically.
Certainly they're picking a lending product because they want the ability and opportunity to revolve periodically.
Now as we've talked about we have some more transactors that we had historically in the portfolio.
But I think lending will continue to be an important revenue stream at 15% but it really depends on how consumers think about debt and how far they want to leverage.
I don't think anybody knows whether that's complete yet or whether it will start to be more willing to take on some more revolving debt periodically.
So really we're going to have to wait and see how customer behavior plays out.
It's hard to pinpoint it since it's really a new space for where they were historically.
But for us the important thing is to put products in the marketplace that meet our customers' needs and then they can use the product in a way that really meets their needs.
So we can continue to be focused on that.
But certainly if there's the ability to put products out there in customers' hands and they would choose to evolve more that's fine with us as long as the credit is right.
Or if they choose to evolve a little less that's fine with us as well.
So we'll have to see how it evolves.
It's really dependent on customer behavior going forward.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And what proportion of your lending book is at introductory rates now? So I don't know what it is but it's very small.
You can certainly see from public data that we are not using balance transfer the way some competitors are.
And even in our acquisition it's not a huge tool.
So I would say the amount at introductory rates is relatively small within the scheme of the whole portfolio.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Less than 10%? I don't know.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just your net interest yield declined.
You've guided to I think in the USCS business 8% to 9%.
Is any proportion -- any portion of the decline this last quarter or any of the guidance driven by CARD Act-related look backs? So the answer to that is no.
We thought it would -- before we started before the CARD Act was passed we were kind of in this high 8% 9% range.
When we put in pricing changes we said our objective was to get back to where we were after the impact of the CARD Act.
And we were successful at doing that.
20 basis points on a year-over-year basis is pretty minor but it's not due to a look back.
Certainly in the future regulators will come and take a look at that and you'll feel pretty comfortable with our position.
But until you actually have somebody come in and look at it you don't know if they concur completely with the steps that we've taken.
But from our perspective we're in an appropriate spot.
And to specifically answer your question no it wasn't due to a look back.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Got it okay.
And then just one unrelated real quick.
What proportion of total billed business is GNS right now? So I don't know exactly.
Have we disclosed this? I think it's about 15% in that range.
Could be 14% could be 16% but we'll take a look and before we get off the phone answer that question.
I think it's 15%.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> This was I think the first time in a while you've seen billed business growth below 20% in GNS.
Is there anything to be cautious -- caution on in that area? So I think we were getting a lift over the last couple of quarters as a result of the Macy's agreement that we put in place.
But if you go back we have many many quarters where GNS business was growing at more than 20%.
And 17% growth which is what I think we had this quarter is pretty darn good.
So I think GNS continues to be a very good line of business for us and we think it has good prospects as we go forward.
And our next question will come from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.
Research Division</strong> Dan I believe earlier you referenced the uptick in U.S.
Card Services the -- or charge card services the charge-off increase.
You mentioned that obviously new business is not going to limit charge-offs but to drive revenue at an economic return.
But can you talk about maybe how you've widened the credit scope maybe for the charge card customer? I don't know if you could give FICO or maybe tiering ranges but it sounds like you're going a little deeper in terms of credit.
So we basically keep our credit standards pretty constant both in the past and now.
Certainly when the recession hit we tightened up some but I think now our view in terms of the type of credit worthiness that we want is not dissimilar to what we've looked for historically.
Certainly we've built in to our models all those earnings that we've had over the past couple of years.
But the good growth we've had is really based on the fact that our strategy is to grow charge card and that we've allocated investments to acquiring charge card customers which is what's really driving really the growth in that business as opposed to having credit standards that are not as tight as we've historically had.
So we'll do it by designing products that customers want to have and by adding both acquisition investments and loyalty investments that drives higher levels of spending.
Research Division</strong> And then regarding marketing and promotion you pointed out that your expense containment you guys are executing on your strategy and one of the key areas of reduction of expense has been marketing.
But it seems that some of your peers are ramping up marketing spend now.
And I was just curious how would you respond to that? Do you watch market share? And I guess is it possible to maintain low marketing spend in the face of an industry that seems to be increasing marketing spend? So we certainly do focus on market share.
I mean one of our objectives is to continue to gain market share.
And if you look back over the last 10 years other than in periods when there's a slowdown we've gained market share.
I think if you went back to 2002 or something our market share was in the U.S.
for credit was 19.9%.
And today it stands at about 26.4%.
So we've made steady progress there and we want to continue to make steady progress.
Now you refer to low levels of investment.
So I would say we're in actually the opposite position.
In terms of marketing in 2010 we took marketing expense to very high levels levels notably above where we've ever been before.
We think about marketing if you look historically as being about 9% of revenues.
And in this quarter we're at 9% of revenue.
So we think those are levels of investment that can drive the business.
So it's nice to have even higher levels.
But at this level we think we can be successful at driving business in a way that helps us meet our financial targets.
And the level of investments that we're making in some of our other businesses that run through the OpEx line as we talked about before we have increased those.
And we think we have levels of spending and investment that again can continue to grow our business.
So I don't think about investments being at a low level.
They are at very healthy levels as we go forward.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And one final question.
As you have pointed out earlier the call revenue seems to be a challenge for you.
And revenue growth seems to be a challenge to the industry.
And just wondering if we're starting to see receivables loans pickup little bit to find like 3% growth.
Is that eventually ever going forward maybe emphasize loan growth a little bit more and collect more interest income to offset maybe slowing billed business growth elsewhere? Yes.
So I think it will be really be driven a little bit by what I talked about before.
We're going to look to continue to have products in the marketplace that meet our customers' needs.
So I would say if we see loan balances decline it would be because the customer's deciding to be more cautious.
And if we see loan growth pickup some it would be because the customer wants to utilize the revolving feature on the products in terms of how they live their lives.
So I think it's going to be more driven by consumers' behavior than us changing our focus on whether we want to just put on more loan balances.
We as a company have never had a target in terms of what loan should be or what loan growth should be.
Where loans go is simply an outcome of how our customers decide to use the products that we put in their hands.
And we have no one else in queue.
Okay very good.
All right.
Thank you everyone for participating on the call.
Have a good evening.
Thank you.
And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's call is being recorded.
I will now like to turn the conference over to Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Welcome and thanks everyone for joining today's call.
Before I turn it over to Dan Henry I want to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the SEC.
In the first quarter 2012 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We have  provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dan completes his remarks we will move to  Q&amp;A.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay.
Thanks Rick.
So I will start on Slide 2.
So revenue net of interest expense for the quarter was $7.6 billion.
That's 8%  higher than the first quarter of last year.
On an FX-adjusted  basis revenue increased 9%.
Net income came in at $1 256 000 000.
Diluted EPS is $1.07 that's up 10% from last year.
And our return on average equity is at 27%.
The decrease in shares outstanding that you see is a reflection of our share buyback program.
Moving to Slide 3 which are our metric performance billed business came in at $211 billion.
That's an increase of 12% year-over-year and 13% on an FX-adjusted  basis.
So this year actually we have a benefit we think from leap year an extra day.
So I would characterize our growth as generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2011 which had growth of about 11%.
Cards-in-force is up to 98 million.
That's a 7% increase from last year.
Cards issued by GNS partners grew 16%.
Proprietary cards grew 2% and so we're up about 1.3 million cards compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.
Average basic card member spending is up 10%.
That's continued high engagement by our customers.
Loans came in at $60 billion.
That's up 4% as it's growing gradually although I note that spending on lending products is growing faster.
And travel sales are up modestly.
If we move to Slide 4 so this is billed business growth by region.
So each region is up modestly reflecting I think again the fact that we had a leap year this year.
Excluding that the growth rates by region are reasonably stable with the fourth quarter.
Europe had a growth rate of 6% in this first quarter.
In Northern Europe the growth rates were higher.
Germany for instance grew at 8%.
The U.K.
also grew at 8%.
Southern Europe was somewhat weaker low single-digit growth.
Spain for instance grew at 2%.
The  growth in each region is similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.
Moving to Slide 5 so this is  billed business growth by segment.
So the red line is the total company and that's at 12%.
GNS is the yellow line and continues to be somewhat above the average for the company and it grew at 17%.
International Consumer is the light blue square line and it's slightly less than the company average coming in at 9% FX adjusted.
And that was influenced by the lower growth rate in Europe.
U.S.
Consumer is the dark blue diamond line and  Global Corporate Services the green triangle.
Here growth rates are similar to the total company.
Moving over to Slide 6 so this is lending billed business compared to managed loan growth.
So the solid line is the growth rate for spending on lending products.
The growth in spending on lending products is in line with the overall growth rate in billed business.
The dotted line is the growth rate in loans.
So we continue to see a difference in the growth rate on lending spending and ending loans though  this gap is narrowing.
The relative ratios of growth rates  going forward will be a function of lending customers' behavior in the future.
I would note and this is not on the slide but I note that  the net interest yield on loans was 9.2%  this quarter and that's the same as the first quarter of 2011.
Slide 7 is revenue performance.
So discount  revenue increased 9% and that reflects 12% growth in billed business.
While we had a 2-basis point decrease in the discount rate from 2.55% in the first quarter of 2011 to 2.35% this quarter and this is driven by our strategy to increase penetration into everyday spend categories as well as the mix of spending.
It was also impacted by the relatively faster growth in GNS and as you know GNS a portion of that discount rate we share with our GNS partners.
It's also impacted by higher contra-revenues including volume-related  incentives to corporate customers and higher cash back rewards.
Card fees grew in line with the growth in proprietary cards-in-force.
Travel commissions and fees reflect slightly higher sales and slightly lower commissions and supplier revenues.
Other commission fees are 10% higher primarily reflecting the full quarter of Loyalty Partner.
So we have 3 months in this quarter.
Last year we just had one month and that's partially offset by lower foreign exchange conversion revenue.
Other revenue increased 22%.
So this reflects higher royalty revenues from GNS partner and also reflects the benefit in revision of our estimate for un-cashed TCs  in international markets.
Net interest income is up 6% and this is driven by a 4% increase in card member loans.
So total revenues grew at 8%.
This is a reflection of our spend-centric model and  enables our growth rate to be faster than our issuing competitors.
Slide 8 is provision for losses.
We could see that the Charge Card provision is $178 million 10% lower than last year.
So the  write-off rate is up slightly as we are growing our business but still at very low levels compared to historic numbers.
But the write-off dollars in the first quarter of 2012 are higher than what we had in 2011 and that's offset by lower fraud and the fact that we had a $14 million reserve release in the first quarter of 2012 compared to a reserve build of $35 million in the first quarter of 2011.
Turning to the lending provision that came in at $212 million which compares to a credit of $120 million in the first quarter of 2011.
The write-off rate is lower in the first quarter of this year compared to last year and you'll see that in a couple of slides.
So we have lower write-off dollars in the quarter.
And as you can see on this slide reserve releases this quarter were $194 million and that compares to $725 million in the first quarter of 2011.
And that difference is really driving the higher provision year-over-year.
Improvement in the delinquency rate again this quarter and improvement in the migration rate is what drove the reserve release this quarter.
Moving to Slide 9 so this is Charge Card credit performance.
So the write-off rate in the Charge Card portfolio have increased slightly both sequentially and compared to last year but again remains at near historic low levels.
Despite the higher write-off rate in USCS the delinquency rate remains stable and our reserve coverage of delinquencies also remains stable.
International Consumer and Global Corporate Services is up slightly but again here at near historic lows.
Moving to Slide 10 so this is lending credit performance.
So the lending write-off rate is at 2.3% this quarter the same as in the fourth quarter of 2011 and notably better than the first quarter of last year.
The lending 30-day past due improved slightly sequentially to 1.4% and compares favorably to the 1.9% in the first quarter of 2011.
These are both at historical low levels and represent the best credit metrics in the industry.
Moving to Slide 11 so this is a chart related to lending reserve coverage.
So U.S.
Card Services and Worldwide reserves as a percentage of loans and reserves as a percentage of past due were less than we had in the first quarter of 2011 and that's driven by improved credit performance and are both approximately the same or slightly lower than what we had in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Now principal month's coverage was 15.9x in the U.S.
and 15.8x worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2011 and they have both moved to 14 months coverage in the first quarter of this year.
So this calculation as you take write-offs in the quarter you divide by 3 to get a monthly average and you divide it into the reserve balance.
So write-offs in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2011 are about the same.
But reserves in the first quarter of this year are lower driven by the improvement in delinquency rates and improved migration rates that I've discussed before.
So we move to Slide 12 so this is our expense performance.
So total expenses increased 4% or adjusted for the Visa and MasterCard settlement were flat in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2011.
Marketing and promotion decreased 11% from last year.
In the quarter marketing and promotion as a percentage of revenues was about 8.3% and this is below the historical level of 9%.
Our plan for the full year is for  marketing and promotion to be approximately 9% of revenues.
However as we've said in the past we will adjust marketing spend depending on economic conditions.
Membership Rewards expense decreased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011 reflecting greater membership rewards and co-brand card-related  expense on spending volume in the quarter but was more than offset by lower increases in the membership reward ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011.
And I'll discuss this in more detail on the next slide.
Card member Services increased 35% reflecting increased cost associated with benefits recently provided to U.S.
card members including statement credits for travel fees for Platinum and Centurion card members the Delta Companion program and lounge access.
I'll discuss operating expense on Slide 14.
The effective tax rate of 29% compares to 32% in the first quarter of last year and this lower rate reflects a tax benefit related to the realization of certain tax credits.
So now we look at Slide 13 which is comparing card member rewards expense in the first quarter of this year to the first quarter of 2011.
Now as you saw on Slide 12 rewards expense is 7% lower in the first quarter of 2012 and you can see that on this slide as well.
So card member rewards expense includes the cost of co-brand products and Membership Rewards.
I'd like to remind you for co-brand products the program partner has the obligation to deliver the reward repay  the co-brand partner each month the amount we expense and have no balance sheet liability.
On the other hand we are responsible for delivering the rewards earned under the Membership Rewards program and have a balance sheet reserve for that.
At year end that was approximately $5 billion.
So Membership Rewards expense is a function of 2 elements.
The cost of points earned in the quarter and expense for points earned in previous periods if the estimate for the ultimate redemption rate changes.
In this chart the blue section includes the co-brand product expense and the MR  rewards expense for points earned in the quarter.
The green section represents MR expense Membership Rewards expense related to  points earned in previous periods due to the increase in the estimate of the ultimate redemption rate.
You can see that the green section of the bar in the first quarter of 2012 is significantly smaller than in the first quarter of 2011.
So the more moderate increase in the ultimate redemption rate is resulting in lower total rewards expense in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 2011.
In 2012 we continue to see increased customer engagement in the Membership Rewards program resulting in a higher ultimate redemption rate estimate but at a rate of change more in line with historic levels prior to 2011.
So I'll move to operating expense on Slide 14.
So total operating expense grew 13%.
Excluding the impact of the Visa/MasterCard  settlement which was a credit last year adjusted operating expense increased 5%.
So salaries and benefits grew 7% reflecting merit increases higher incentive-related  compensation and higher benefits-related costs.
Professional services increased 4%.
This is due to higher technology costs and higher third-party agent commissions which relate to signing smaller merchants offset by lower collection costs.
Occupancy equipment increased 11% and this includes costs associated with Loyalty Partner and higher data processing costs.
Adjusted other net decreased 16% primarily due to a reclass and we're reclassing a  benefit related to cross-currency funding hedges in the period.
So I'll move to Slide 15 again talking to operating expense.
So this slide provides 8 quarters of history on operating expense.
At $3.1 billion in this quarter we believe this is the level of operating expense that will enable us to drive business growth.
Going forward we will continue to implement our plan to contain the operating expenditures.
When we think about 2012 you should also be mindful that the first quarter of 2011 was the low point for operating expenses in 2011 as you can see on this chart.
You can also see that operating expenses were similar in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.
Now I'm not making the forecast here but if operating expenses stay at the current level the growth rate for the full year adjusted for the Visa/MasterCard  settlement proceeds would be in the low single digits.
Our objective over the next 2 or 3 years will be to grow operating expenses more slowly than the growth in revenues.
Moving to Slide 16 so this is regarding expense flexibility over time.
So this slide shows adjusted expense as a percentage of revenue.
Now adjusted expense excludes credit provision.
On the left side of slide you can see 5 years of history and on the right side the past 5 quarters.
So adjusted expense as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of this year continues to come down from the historically high levels that we saw in 2010 and '11.
Over time we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first through top line revenue growth; and second through expense flexibility which includes our plan to contain operating expense growth.
I'll  now move to Slide 17 which are our capital ratios.
You can see that Tier 1 common ratio increased to 13.4% from 12.3% at year end.
We generated additional capital through net income and employee plans and at the same time risk weighted assets decreased mostly due to lower loan levels.
Share repurchases did not start until mid-March after the Fed completed their review of our capital distribution plan.
As we continue to execute against our plan to return capital to shareholders and potentially pursue acquisition opportunities we would expect that that Tier 1 common ratio would move down in subsequent quarters.
Slide 18 our payout ratio.
So this is the total payout ratio and the bars represent the percentage of capital generated that we return to shareholders.
On the left side is the last 5 years and on the right side is the past 4 quarters.
In 2011 which is the middle of the chart we returned 56% of capital to shareholders and this is in line with our stated objective of returning approximately 50% of capital generated to shareholders.
So the Fed has reviewed our 2012 capital distribution plan along with 18 other large bank holding companies including the operating performance of all 19 banks under stressed economic conditions.
We believe the results demonstrate the strength and flexibility of our business model and our balance sheet.
For example our minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio a measure of balance sheet strength was the third highest among all 19 banks.
While looking at measures of operating performance under these stressed scenarios we were best in class among the 19 participants.
Our capital plan is to return capital to shareholders.
Our capital plan of returning capital to shareholders is both through our dividend which we increased to $0.20 per share per quarter from $0.18 and we'll also use share repurchases in an amount up to $4 billion in 2012 and $1 billion in the first quarter of 2013.
Next is Slide 19 a liquidity snapshot.
So we continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet 12 months of funding maturities.
We have $20 billion of excess cash and securities.
The next month of maturities is $13 billion.
So this is larger than our normal excess and has been driven by the seasonal decline in loans in the first quarter continued strong growth in our direct deposits which you'll see on the next slide and an unsecured debt issuance at the end of March under  favorable capital market conditions.
So Slide 20 is our U.S.
retail deposits by type.
As  we have limited cash needs in the first quarter total retail deposits increased only $20 million.
You can see that on the right-hand side of the chart.
We did increase  direct deposits by $1.2 billion.
You can see that on the left side of the chart while third-party CDs decreased by $1.1 billion.
So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.
Results for the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters as well as continued execution against our plan to migrate towards historic expense to revenue ratios.
Spending growth remains strong and we continue to grow above the average rate of our large issuing competitors despite difficult prior year comparisons.
Given the challenging global economic environment we are pleased with the strength of international billings growth including in Europe where we saw a modest increase in the growth rate.
We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year with net  yield comparable to the prior year and lending growth and a growth in net interest income of 6%.
At the same time lending loss rate remains stable near all-time lows.
Despite very strong credit performance provision expense did increase as lending reserve releases were significantly lower this year compared to the prior year.
Our strong billings growth the growth in net interest income and higher other non-interest revenues drove revenue growth in line with our on average and over time target of 8%.
Our revenue growth which reflects the benefit of our spend-centric model stands in contrast to many other issuance  that still face year-over-year revenue declines.
In the first quarter strong revenue growth was paired with well-contained  total expense growth to generate strong earnings.
We are still investing in the business and these investments are driving higher average spending and growth in our card base while enabling us to build capabilities for the future.
In addition we are continuing to implement our plan to grow operating expense more slowly than revenues over the next 2 to 3 years.
Looking ahead we recognize that the year-over-year comparisons will continue to be difficult and that we will not have the benefit of the Visa/MasterCard  settlement proceeds or significant credit reserve releases but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead.
In fact the results of the recent Fed stress tests further demonstrate the unique aspects of our model and highlights its inherent flexibility and the ability to generate capital even under severe stress assumptions.
We have started our share buyback program increased our dividend and maintained flexibility as we considered balancing acquisitions and share buybacks.
Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions.
[Operator Instructions]  We'll go to the first line of Nomura.
Research Division</strong> It's Brian Foran.
I wonder if you could -- maybe just given how things are evolving in Europe any color or thoughts you have on more recent customer behavior there? Are you still seeing the improvement you saw hold up or are you seeing starting to weaken again? So  the fourth quarter we had loan growth -- not loan growth billed business growth that was kind of in the mid-single  digits.
What we're  seeing then is that we had stronger growth in the northern part of Europe.
We had somewhat slower growth in the southern part of Europe.
The U.K.
was performing more in line with what we saw in Northern Europe.
Actually that trend has continued into the first quarter.
So we had overall growth in Europe of 6% stronger in Northern Europe and the U.K.
a little less so in the south.
So I would say the trend in the first quarter was very comparable to what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.
So some stabilization.
Research Division</strong> I guess I don't know if it's something you can comment on but do all those comments carry through to April as well or things  evolve since then? Yes absolutely the last couple of weeks so we're not going to comment on April at this time.
Research Division</strong> Okay fair enough.
And then the follow-up I had was I realized Charge Card performance is very strong in a historical context but just any more color on why loss rates are trending up over the past 4 quarters? Anything you're observing in the data? Yes.
So the overall growth rate is 12%.
We actually have very similar growth rates in lending and charge so they both are seeing very strong growth.
The tick up that we saw up to 2.3% in the first quarter this year is really a pretty minor tick up and at 2.3% represents very low levels compared to what we've historically seen.
We did notice that and we took a close look at delinquencies.
And so delinquencies this quarter stand at 1.9%.
And that's exactly the same delinquency rate that we had in the fourth quarter and very comparable to what we had last year.
So we don't have a concern about where write-offs  are.
In fact it's our expectation as we grow the business that we would expect to see some tick up over time in the write-off rates both potentially in charge and in lending.
But when that will happen will be dependent on the growth in the business and customer behavior.
So  bottom line is that tick up is not a concern to me.
And we'll go to the line of Citigroup.
Moving on to the regulatory environment I mean clearly your fundamentals are great.
If you could just talk a little bit about maybe the CFPB  and what kind of interactions you've had with them and what they might -- where if any concerns you might have from the regulatory side? Well we started to engage with the CFPB.
They are I think on site at this juncture.
They're just starting their work.
So I think it's going to be some time before we have findings from them or reports from them.
The findings that the FDIC has had which we disclosed in the 10-K they have shared those with the CFPB.
We have not heard back from them on any reaction to that.
They're a new regulator so like everyone else we're going to have to wait and see exactly what their observations are.
But we have started to engage with them.
We have a number of new regulators from [indiscernible] the bank holding company.
The Fed was a new regulator for us.
We have worked very hard with the Fed to establish good relations.
We think we've been successful at doing that.
Our plan would be to do the same exact thing with the CFPB to be open with them and listen to any observations that they have.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just real quickly it looks like there was a reclassification of card fees out of net interest income.
Can you talk a little bit about that? Okay.
So this is -- sorry I was getting a little help there.
So there were some card fees that came with bank holding company.
We decided should be included in interest income.
Upon further review we have decided that we should put it back into  card fees.
So there's no change in revenues at all or the economics or the bottom line.
It's just a classification of what revenue line that it's on.
Research Division</strong> And what kind of card fees were those? It's just the annual fee that we get on lending products and there was an interpretation of a certain accounting rule that we thought would cause us to move to split the card fees and  put a portion up in interest income but I have decided that that is not where we should put it and so we've really just reclassed it back.
Simply low economics.
There's no impact on the total revenue line or on the bottom line.
And we restated the prior year.
Next we'll go to the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.
Just 2 things.
Could you tell us was there  any effect on expenses because of the extra day for leap year? Is it really just the revenue effect? So I would have answered that question no but this is like more of an issue that we should really get into here but we actually do accrue some salaries kind of on a day basis so there might have been a slight impact on salaries and benefits as a result of that.
But I don't think there's any large impact at all here.
Since you have another day of spending you get it on the revenue level.
Rewards will be an example to the extent you have more billed business you're going to have some more rewards.
Okay.
And then can you just clarify what the adjustment for the Traveler Cheque liability was how much that could be? And then you do note in the supplement expenses for Enterprise Growth? Can you give us a sense of how much that is in the quarter? Okay so Travelers Cheques to the extent that there are travelers cheques that are sold in the U.S.
if customers do not redeem them we sheet  those to the States.
So there's no income related to that.
However for travelers cheques that are sold outside of the United States other countries do not have a stringent law.
And so we estimate how much of those travelers cheques will not be redeemed.
We actually pick up an estimate of that at the time we sell the travelers' cherub.
We then step back and look at history and to see where the things are performing the way they have historically done.
In a recent review this quarter we realized that in fact fewer of those cheques were being encashed  if they were older and so we simply revise our estimates of the amount that will not be encashed.
And there was a credit in this quarter related to that.
And about how much was it? So it's small enough -- it's a big enough number that we should mention but not a large enough number that we'd give the dollar amount.
Less than a $0.01 a share? Less than  a $0.05 a share? So I'll just say we wanted to know it because it's not inconsequential but it's not significant.
In terms of Enterprise Growth we haven't disclosed the exact amount we're  spending there.
We do think that it represents a very good an important opportunity for us.
And so we are investing against those initiatives.
At this point they are investments that aren't generating large amounts of revenue.
Anytime you start a new business you need to continue to calibrate.
Some things work less well than you thought others better than you thought.
And we shift our investments accordingly.
So we are making notable investments in Enterprise Growth because it's a terrific opportunity.
But again the final number that we disclose.
Right.
I figured I might as well ask because you have it in the supplement.
And then can you just give us a sense of what  we should expect for the tax rate for the balance of the year? I think the tax rate absent any specific credits in the period that occur is generally in the low 30s 31% 32%.
And then to the extent there's a credit like we had this quarter that benefit will be reflected in the rate.
So without any item like that would be in the 31% 32% range.
We'll go to the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just real quickly Enterprise Growth seems to be certainly the buzzword around American Express.
Can you talk to us about a little bit of advancements that you've made in the quarter and what sort of roadmaps and things we should be thinking about in terms of announcements or progress or really frankly numerical -- numbers trying to come up to the surface in terms of progress that you've made on Enterprise Growth? Well I think our whole businesses is kind of a buzzword right? So our core business is performing exceptionally well as you could see by a strong billed business very good revenue growth excellent credit performance.
And the digital space which is where Enterprise Growth is is also a big factor in our core business.
So we are doing a significant number of things in the core business.
I think you can see the things that we've done with small businesses.
I think we've done a number of initiatives with Facebook and Twitter in Serve but also in our core business.
We're  also enabling our customers that want to interact with us from a servicing perspective online to do that.
We're also enabling people who want to acquire  cards to do it online.
So digital and American Express is a buzzword.
We think it's important that we think about transforming the company because  digital will be a big part of the future.
As we've said it's actually a big part of today.
Digital spending is last year was $130 billion of our $800 billion.
So it's an important part of things that we're thinking about and investing in.
Within Serve and Enterprise Growth we are also investing there as I said.
So some of the progress we're making as we've said is we were very focused last year on signing distribution deals.
And this year it's all about executing against those distribution deals so that we can bring customers on to the Serve platform.
We're  very focused on that and we haven't at this juncture decided on sharing metrics.
At some point in the future we will.
And we'll really you mentioned revenues and again I think this is an area where of investment revenues will flow more in the future.
But to your point we're not just investing without monitoring and assessing how we're doing.
And so we do have guideposts out there that we're  very focused on in terms of what we're achieving and what parts are being successful and which ones aren't.
And as I said before we will calibrate our investments accordingly.
But we do think we're accomplishing very positive things.
Next we'll go to the line of Brad Ball with Evercore.
Research Division</strong> Dan I have a quick follow-up to that.
Can you give us a sense as to what portion of billed business growth came from online and mobile? We don't do that by quarter.
But as I said $130 million of the $800 million last year was digital online.
And last year we saw the digital growth at 22% of billings.
So billings on the Internet were up 22%.
I don't know the exact number for this quarter but I strongly suspect it's in all likelihood growing at a faster rate than the average.
Research Division</strong> So faster than the 12% or 11% adjusted for the leap day? So I haven't actually seen the number Brad but I would think that it probably is.
Very strong growth.
Research Division</strong> And then just as a follow-up to that a point of clarification.
So you have board authorization and approval from the Fed for a buyback of up to $4 billion this year and up to $1 billion next year but you talk about returning 50% of your capital to shareholders.
So those amounts would exceed that 50%.
So are those numbers just out there as sort of upside ranges? And if you don't exhaust the full $4 billion this year is there a need to carry over into next year? How does that work? So our overall philosophy here is to retain 50% of capital generated to grow the business either  supporting growth in the balance sheet you  need capital to do that or for acquisitions.
And to return the other 50% in the form of either dividends or share buybacks.
To the extent we do less acquisitions then we wanted to have the flexibility to do share buybacks.
In 2011 we requested $2.3 billion of buybacks on the basis that we'd do about $2 billion in acquisitions.
At the end of the day based on the opportunities we saw we did $900 million in acquisitions.
And as a result we've built over $1 billion of capital that we haven't planned on.
So we made the submission this year.
We did it on the basis that we would have the flexibility to do acquisitions if we identified the right opportunities but also asked for a buyback amount of $4 billion in the event that we didn't do the planned level of acquisitions.
So you're right if we actually do $4 billion of share buybacks we will be returning a significantly higher percentage of capital generated to shareholders.
But it's really a trade-off between acquisition spending and buybacks.
The less we do in acquisitions the more we do in buybacks.
The more we do in acquisitions the less we do in buybacks.
Research Division</strong> And if you don't exhaust the $4 billion would it carry over into next year or are you back into the submission process in January of next year so you have to see what the Fed will approve? So I have not asked them that question but I would assume that if we do less than $4 billion there's not a carryover.
We would do a submission next January and then that will become effective whatever that plan is will become effective after the approval which would be mid-March I assume.
And what you're allowed to do in 2013 will be based on the plan you submit and whether the Fed does not object to that plan.
So I don't think there's a carryover except if you didn't do it you may wind up with higher capital going in which might give you greater flexibility in your submission.
Next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Research Division</strong> Question on expenses on clarity and then tie that to growth because I mean over the last several years as American Express laid out very well you were investing very heavily the benefits from lower falling credit losses in the Visa/MasterCard payments.
Now you talked about the $3.1 billion of expenses in the quarter Dan Pages 15 and 16 and I mean I think -- and while it's clear you're going to grow expenses slower than revenue it sounded like that $3 billion was -- as you were suggesting that was going to be kind of a steady run rate for the year.
And then I mean just as that ties to growth you had -- I mean you grew 8% historically.
You've said at least 8% revenue growth is what American Express had targeted prior to the downturn.
Can you still get this? Can you still drive the revenue growth with pulling back on the investment spend? So 2 questions.
Yes okay.
So we knew all along that as you said we were spending at higher levels in 2010 and '11.
And that  was helping to drive growth.
But at the operating expense level that we have which is higher than we had in the beginning of 2010 or in the first quarter of 2011 at this level we think we have sufficient resources to drive growth going forward.
So it's higher than it was back in those periods but we think it's a level that is appropriate and would enable us to drive revenue to achieve our on-average  and over-time  targets.
So that's our perspective.
We're going to control them well but we think we have the resources.
Research Division</strong> And the $3.1 billion this quarter through the year is I mean were you suggesting on Page 15 that -- I mean I wasn't totally clear and you pointed out last year was lower in the first quarter then grew.
Are you -- I mean I think it sounded like you might be suggesting that the $3 billion was going to be kind of a run rate for this year before you grow next year or did I misread it? So it's going to be -- not to give a forecast all right so I don't want to do that.
As you know we don't  do that.
But I was simply making the observation that if operating expense continued at the current level and you adjusted for the Visa/MasterCard  proceeds and then you took that number and compared it to last year that you would have low single-digit growth right? So I wasn't saying exactly what it's going to be but I was trying to illustrate if it was at that level what the growth rate would be which is in line with we've  talked about being -- containing operating expense growth.
But we do believe that at that level that we have the resources necessary to continue to grow the business and achieve our on-average and over-time  financial targets.
Research Division</strong> So there's one follow-up on the one I mean quarter overall look very impressive but the one number that surprised me that was weaker was the travel number travel growth.
And it seems like all the data market data we look at on travel spend look like very strong growth MasterCard and Visa giving out some very strong cross-border spend numbers.
Is there a -- within GSS the commercial business was there a significant client loss? Or what happened to your travel business that doesn't match with the market data and the competitive data we've heard? Yes so I think sales were actually up slightly but commissions were down a bit and supplier revenues which are an important part of the economics sometimes are lumpy.
And they were down a little year-over-year.
So sales again I guess are the key thing in this discussion about just volumes and they were off low single digits.
But that's the travel experience.
I don't think we had major losses that I'm aware of but those are the volumes that we were at.
Research Division</strong> Because it looked like you lost some share but you're not sure why.
So I wouldn't comment on share it's more kind of a client by client is what you're doing when dealing with corporate clients but certainly sales for business travel were lower than what we experienced in billed business and our Card business.
So that's a fair comparison.
We have a question from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.
Research Division</strong> Wanted to ask you about the Membership Rewards costs.
In the fourth quarter you made a comment discussing roughly 78 basis points as a percentage of billed business ex-GNS  to think of for that cost and that we can think of that for '12.
In the first quarter it was up around 81 and I was curious if you're still thinking about that level for the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry for the year to average out or should we be thinking about that a little differently? And additionally can we expect going forward dividends to grow at a rate similar to earnings which I believe had been your history prior to the recession? So let me answer the second question first.
So that's exactly right.
So we think about that we want to have dividends at a certain relationship to income and we kind of keep it in the 17% or 18% range.
So if net income increases then we would stay with the same philosophy and increase dividends to be in line with that percentage that I talked about 16% 17% 18%.
So that's exactly right.
And as you point out I mean you can calculate the numbers.
It was 78% -- 78 basis points in the last quarter and 81 basis points in this first quarter.
So it's really somewhat dependent on what's happening with the ultimate redemption rate.
And if you look over time if you had if you look at the schedule if you look back to say the second quarter of 2010 many of the quarters are between this 78-basis point range and 81 basis points.
The only time it's really gone above that were in the quarters of 2011 where we had higher growth in the ultimate redemption rate in each quarter than we have seen historically.
So in this quarter the ultimate redemption rate growth was more similar to the historical levels that we saw prior to 2011.
But where it goes is going to be totally dependent on customer behavior.
As we've said the ultimate redemption rate goes up when we see redemption levels go up -- if we see redemption levels go up that's greater  engagement to the long-term health of the franchise.
That's a very good thing.
It puts some expense in the quarter but it's very good for the long-term health of the franchise.
Research Division</strong> So it sounds like we should think about a range similar to what you said 78 basis points to 82 basis points or so at least for this year.
So I didn't say exactly.
You said -- but I did  give you those data points.
And your next question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> Question on the share repurchase.
I was just wondering as far as like timing and the M&amp;A pipeline I was wondering I mean could you just talk about that pipeline and how we should model in the share repurchase to the extent that there are opportunities available? And you guys may not kind of push the lever too hard on share repurchase.
And then secondarily on top line growth I was wondering if you could just talk about billed business growth going forward.
It seemed like you guys had some decent momentum in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter but the comps obviously get tougher as the year progresses.
How confident are you that you keep that momentum going? And then just finally on the top line growth can you just talk about the contra-revenue  items as well? Are there any big kind of contra-revenue  items that we should think about and how they trend over the course of the year? Okay.
So starting with share buybacks and acquisitions.
So as you know we have not relied on acquisitions to drive our growth.
It's been primarily driven by organic growth and our investments in our business.
Our philosophy is to do what I refer to as bolt-on type acquisitions where we either acquire a capability that we can leverage within our existing business or acquire near-in  adjacencies that are fee-based in nature.
Loyalty Partner would  be a good  example of that.
So our philosophy is that we want to take a look at acquisitions that fall within  those parameters.
If we see good acquisitions with good economics then we're  going to make those acquisitions.
But if we don't identify acquisitions that meet our criteria we're not going to do them for the sake of doing acquisitions.
So what we actually do in 2012 will be calibrated by the opportunities we see and the assessments we make of the economics.
We see good acquisitions we'll do them.
If not we'll use  the capital to do share buybacks.
Now in terms of billed business we think we have had excellent billed business over the past 2 years.
Certainly excellent compared to the industry.
We've had 9 quarters in a row where we've had double-digit growth in billed business.
Certainly really excellent compared to the industry.
And we continue to believe that we have sufficient resources to continue to drive strong growth and have business momentum going forward.
So I think where we're constructing our plan is to continue to drive spend focus on our spend-centric model and to be successful in the future in terms of taking  share as we have been over the last decade.
In terms of contra-revenues so contra-revenues  include cash rewards.
As I mentioned those are up this quarter.
We issued recently a new product that was a cashback product.
That  higher reward level would indicate as being successful in the marketplace.
We do give volume incentives to certain corporate customers.
So to the extent  they're hitting higher levels of spend that's a good thing economically but it is a contra-revenue.
We  also have sometimes signing bonuses that go in the slide.
This quarter that wasn't at a higher level than we've seen historically.
And for the other impact on the relationship between billed business and discount rate is GNS right.
So GNS is a terrific success story.
We share a part of the revenue with our partners.
We keep some to ourselves.
That has the impact of bringing down creating a gap in that relationship.
So those are the largest items that are impacting the difference between billed business and discount revenue within our P&amp;L.
You do have a question from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> The one item  in the expenses that  was a little bit surprising directionally was the occupancy and equipment.
And the reason I say that is it's my recollection that this is the quarter where the Greensboro shutdown actually goes into effect.
Was there any lingering expense associated with Greensboro or is this net of that shutdown and the other facilities that you added actually more than offset it? So it really doesn't have anything to do with Greensboro.
The things -- the costs we were going to incur related to that that were people related we accrued upfront.
There are no notable Greensboro expenses in here.
We have largely wound that down at this juncture.
So that is not a factor in this quarter.
So you're asking me if that was lower because we don't have Greensboro is that the question? Research Division</strong> I'm sorry you got muted out in the middle of that but my question is I'm surprised  that occupancy went up this quarter on a year-over-year basis.
It was the only expense where you didn't really show a degree of operating leverage.
So I'm curious with that coming out.
What the incremental expense was? I got you okay.
So Greensboro is not a large factor here in the year-over-year comparison just from a occupancy cost perspective.
The reason it's up is Loyalty Partner is part of it.
So we had again 3 months in here for their occupancy as opposed to only 1 month last year.
And we do have some -- so this is occupancy and equipment.
So the equipment part is we do have some higher data processing costs which are just related to the higher volumes that we're experiencing and the fact that we continue to invest in capabilities.
So those are the things that are the main drivers of the increase of 11%.
And you do have a question from Mark DeVries with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> We've got a follow-up question on your capital plans.
By our estimate under the plan you have the ability to pay back up to about 100% of earnings.
Given that you're already sitting on a pretty large capital cushion of in excess of $2 billion and loan growth has been moderate and M&amp;A has not been that big of a part of your business recently was there any thought of asking for a payout in excess of 100% so you could start to draw down some of that cushion? So I think if you look at schedules that investment banks have put together we probably are  at the high end in terms of what we requested in terms of buybacks.
We were sitting at 12.3% right at the end of last year in terms of Tier 1 common.
So for the moment that's a comfortable place to be.
We don't know what all of the final rules will be as  relates to what capital we'll be required to hold.
In addition to that we  are still in the process of looking at Basel II so we don't know completely what impacts that could potentially have on us.
Well we simply go from Basel I to Basel III.
There's not a big impact there.
We've disclosed those numbers but we've yet to complete our work on Basel II.
Once the rules are completed and we have a full assessment of the impact of Basel and the ultimate rules that are out there we'll think about exactly where we want to settle.
But we didn't contemplate asking for higher buybacks to actually take the ratio down beyond what our plan that we submitted was.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
If you -- if M&amp;A was a meaningful part of your plans for this year would you still contemplate potentially using the full authorization and bring your ratio down in that course? So I think if we did a modest level of acquisitions we would probably tend towards the higher end of the $4 billion range.
If we do higher levels of acquisitions then we would bring the $4 billion down correspondingly.
Next question will come from the line of Ken Bruce with Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> My question relates to several that have been asked but would like to maybe get you to step back for a second and give us a sense around the expense management.
How long do you think it will take for your adjusted expenses to get back to the historical norm? Obviously there's a couple different things that can ultimately drive those down.
But I'm wondering how long you think they're going to remain elevated before you get down to that 67% level? Yes okay.
So we said we were going to head back towards those levels right? And in that calculation provision is not an element.
So to the extent going forward provision is a lower percentage of revenues than it was historically if that were the case.
Then really to kind of  achieve the kind of margins we want you wouldn't have to get all the way back to  67%.
So we'll calibrate things based on both of those factors.
I think we've made very good progress to date.
We've gotten back to 71% in this quarter.
So I think we're making very good progress.
I won't forecast exactly what the ratios will be going forward but as you intimated in your question we can really get there 1 or 2 ways right.
We can get there through very good containment of expenses and we can also get there by good revenue growth.
And to the extent we get good revenue growth then we actually have more flexibility in terms of the level of operating expenses that we have.
So we want to calibrate all these pieces together so that we have strong growth with the right margins and the right returns for shareholders.
So I think you consider all those things as we move forward.
But we think the progress that we've made is good and we think we have thoughtful  plans in place as we go forward.
Okay.
And just as a follow-up to that when you look at the new businesses  that you're investing in I think you've made some comments in the past that those are very decent margin businesses.
They may look different than your historical business.
Your margins in the quarter were down 23% and change I think from 24%.
Do you think that at some point your pretax operating margin begins to drift higher or do you think -- what would you kind of say is the stable level when you look at your new business investments beginning to actually kind of kick in? It's a little hard to assess since we have to actually see exactly what the structure is for revenues.
We've run scenarios and in those scenarios we have good economics associated with those.
But exactly how that whole  space will play out will take honestly a couple of years to do and we'll see what margins we have.
We think about financial returns we think about growth we think about margins we think about  return on equity.
So the total economics across all those metrics could be somewhat different or similar to what we have today and we'll have to wait and see exactly how they play out.
But we think it's a sector that will have high growth in the future.
We think we have the capabilities to be successful in that space and we think the returns will be good.
And concerning all those things are the reason that we're making the investments in that space.
That will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Dan I was looking at  the slide I think it's Slide 12 that had -- 13 actually that had the rewards expense.
And the green part of the bar that represented the increase for points previously earned you had mentioned that that was $188 million in 2011.
So if you were to subtract that the total amount for the first quarter this year is only less than 6% higher.
So I guess how do we kind of square those numbers given that you've got 12% growth in Charge volume and you're saying that there is some increase in the liability on top of that? I think the green bar for the first quarter of 2011 actually has 2 pieces in it.
One we revised the estimation process in which we -- under which we actually did the ultimate redemption calculation.
That was the $188 million.
Also in that quarter just in the normal course based on the behavior of the customers the ultimate redemption rate increased for that as well.
So the green bar includes both of those pieces not just the $188 million.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And also on the Slide 11 on credit you've gone from 16 months coverage of principal down to 14.
And that's kind of a concurrent measure not a prospective one.
So I would assume  that you're not going to take that all the way down to 12 if receivables are growing and there's potential for dollars of losses to go up at some point  in the not-too-distant future.
How much room do you have to take  that 14 down or from the standpoint of the reserve at this point? Yes.
So for us this calculation was really just an outcome of how we set reserves.
So we don't  target a particular level of coverage.
We set reserves.
We have a migration model that we look at using history.
If there are a need for specific reserves with something that's  not captured there we include that.
We have some higher reserves for TDRs.
So that is what drives where we set reserves not this metric.
This is simply an outcome.
It's one that people follow so we've provided but it's not a driver of how we set reserves.
Reserves are going to be driven by the behavior of our customer what delinquencies are what the  migration rates are.
So that's what's driving our reserves.
Research Division</strong> All right.
Does that essentially mean your migration says that dollar losses are coming down in the future? Well not in the future right.
So if you look at this quarter the migration rates were better in this quarter than they were in the fourth quarter of 2011.
We're using history right.
We're using a certain period of history to help guide us there.
Okay.
So thanks everybody for joining the call and good evening.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive TeleConference Service.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded.
And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Welcome.
We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call.
The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2011 10-K and Q1 2012 10-Q report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the second quarter 2012 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dan completes his remarks we will move to Q&amp;A.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay.
Thanks Rick.
So I'll start on Slide 2.
Total revenues net of interest expense came in at $7 965 000 000.
That's an increase of 5% compared to last year.
On an FX-adjusted basis it's an increase of 7%.
Income from continuing operations was $1 339 000 000.
That's an increase of 3%.
EPS from continuing operations came in at $1.15.
That's 7% increase compared to last year.
The difference in growth rate between EPS and income from continuing operations are the share buybacks that we've been doing.
If you go 2 lines down you can see that the diluted shares outstanding are down 4% compared to the second quarter of 2011.
And return on equity came in at 27%.
So moving to Slide 3 these are our second quarter 2012 metrics.
Billed business comes in at $221.6 billion.
That's 7% higher on a reported basis and 9% higher on an FX-adjusted basis.
And throughout you'll see that FX is having a larger impact on reported results than normal because of the strength of the U.S.
dollar.
If we were to look back at billed business growth just to see a trend if you went back to the second quarter of 2011 on an FX-adjusted basis we had growth of 15% in billed business.
That moved to 13% in the third quarter of last year 11% in the fourth quarter.
It ticked up to 13% in the first quarter of this year.
However it had the benefit of leap year and came in at 12.6% so round that up.
So I view that more similar to the fourth quarter at 11%.
But in this quarter we're 9%.
So we are seeing a slowing in the growth rates over really the last 4 quarters.
So cards-in-force are up to $100 million up 6% from last year.
GNS cards are growing at 15% and proprietary cards are growing at 2%.
We again see good growth in basic cardmember spending which illustrates the high level of customer engagement that we have.
Cardmember loans are $61 billion that compares with $60.1 billion in the first quarter of this year and 4% growth compared to the second quarter of 2011.
Worldwide travel sales increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis.
So moving to Slide 4 this is billed business growth by segment FX-adjusted.
So each business really had a similar slowing in billed business growth for the quarter.
Each decreased about 3% or 4% so really broad-based slowing in the growth rate.
GNS continues to be the highest growth rate at 13%.
If we move to Slide 5 this is billed business growth by region again FX-adjusted.
And here again you can see that each region has a similar slowing in the billed business growth rate that ranges from a decline of 2% to 4% and again is broad-based.
And as you'd expect EMEA has the lowest growth rate but still had positive growth at 4%.
Just a little information for countries within EMEA Germany had a growth of 5% U.K.
grew at 4% Italy was flat with last year and Spain decreased 5%.
JAPA continues to be the highest-growth region.
So moving to Slide 6.
So this is providing some information on billed business in international currencies.
So we're providing this because of the impact that foreign exchange was having on the reported numbers.
So just to take you through the slide obviously these are several of our major countries that we operate in.
The first information there so looking at the euro for instance the 5% to 7% is the approximate range of billed business in the euro compared to total billed business.
For Australia it's 5% to 6%.
If you go down to the next line this is really the year-over-year change in the foreign currency compared to the U.S.
dollar.
So in the second quarter of 2012 the strength of the U.S.
dollar drove a 2% reduction in our billed business growth rate.
So as you know in periods of a strengthening U.S.
dollar volume metrics and revenue growth rates are negatively impacted when translated back into U.S.
dollars while inversely expense [ph] growth rates benefit from the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar.
As we have estimated in our 2011 annual report the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S.
dollar related to overseas operations for 12 months would be about $175 million.
So that's an annual amount if there was a 10% impact.
And as you can see for the numbers on this slide that impact is in aggregate less than 10%.
So in general it's our policy to hedge the P&amp;L one quarter out.
Slide 7.
So this is lending billed business which is the solid line the growth rate in lending billed business.
And the dotted line is the growth rate in managed loans.
So we still have a gap.
We have a growth rate of lending billed business being higher at 9% compared to managed loans which is growing at 4%.
But the gap continues to narrow.
Now paydown increased quite a bit in 2009 and 2010 but has stabilized in recent quarters.
In the second quarter the trust paydown rate was 31.5% and that's well above industry average.
And as I'll speak to in a few minutes our credit is behaving very well on loans.
So moving to Slide 8 so this is revenue performance.
So total revenues grew at 5%.
It's not on this slide but on FX-adjusted basis it grew at 7%.
So starting with discount revenue it grew at 5% and this reflects 7% billed business growth offset by higher contra-revenues including corporate incentive payments and higher cash rebates.
Average discount rate on the second quarter of this year was 2.54% which is flat with the second quarter of 2011 although over time we still expect the average discount rate to decrease slightly due to pricing incentives and mix change.
If we look at the next 3 revenue lines: net card fees travel commissions and fees and other commissions and fees on a reported basis they're basically flat but on an FX-adjusted basis they are growing at between 3% and 4%.
So if we look at other revenues that increased 21% and that includes a $30 million gain on the sale of a portion of our ICBC investment a favorable revision in the estimate of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in international markets and higher royalty payments from our GNS partners.
Looking at net interest income it increased 4% and that's driven by 4% growth in loans.
And our net yield is the same this year as it was in the second quarter of 2011 resulting in 4% net interest income growth.
So moving to Slide 9 so this is provision for losses.
Credit continues to perform very well.
However provision increased 29% as lending reserve releases are well below what we saw in the second quarter of 2011.
In charge card we had higher write-off dollars in the second quarter of this year compared to last year and that was offset by higher reserve releases in the second quarter of this year than last year all these -- although these are much smaller amounts than what we see in lending.
But the net of that is that the charge card provision is flat as you can see on this chart.
Now in lending we had lower write-offs in the second quarter of this year.
The write-offs this year were $370 million compared to $511 million last year so write-offs are $140 million lower in this period so that would drive provision down.
However we had lower reserve releases as you can see on the chart and therefore the benefit of reserve releases were about $230 million less than last year.
And as a result the lending provision is $100 million higher than we had in the second quarter of 2011.
So moving to Slide 10 so these are charge card credit metrics.
And as you can see on the left the U.S.
consumer and small business group had higher write-off rates in the second quarter of 2011 at 2% compared to 1.5% in the second quarter of last year.
And that's why on the prior chart we had higher write-off dollars in charge card.
But I will note that the 2% is lower than the 2.3% in write-offs that we saw in the first quarter this year.
International Consumer and Global Corporate products for the right chart you can see that credit continues to perform very well and these are -- all of these metrics are at historically low levels.
Next I'll take you to Slide 11.
So these are lending credit metrics.
And on the left you can see that the write-off rate decreased from 3.1% in the second quarter of 2011 to 2.2% in the second quarter of this year and it's also down 10 basis points from 2.3% in the first quarter.
So in the second quarter of this year if you look at it by month in April the write-off rate was 2.4%.
In May it was 2.2% and in June it was 2.0%.
So we have an improving trend in the quarter.
If you look at the right side this is 30 days past due and this is also improving.
So it improved from 1.6% in the second quarter of last year to 1.4% in the first quarter of this year and 1.3% this quarter.
So I'll just remind you that our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate but achieve the best economic gain when we make investments.
But these metrics are at historic low levels and represent best-in-class credit metrics in the industry.
Slide 12.
So this is lending reserve coverage.
You can see that both the U.S.
card and worldwide reserves as a percentage of loans continue to come down as the write-off rates and the "30 day past due" rates improve.
So the percentage now for the U.S.
card is 2.6% and worldwide is 2.5%.
Reserves as a percentage of past due are similar this quarter to the percentages that we had in the first quarter of this year and that's true for the principal months coverage as well.
So for those people who can hear the thunder in the background if you're not in New York it's a big lightning and thunder storm here.
So the reserves we think are appropriate based on the credit models that we use to set reserves.
Moving to Slide 13 so this is expense performance.
So here you can see that total expenses increased 4 -- 2% and on an FX-adjusted basis which is not on the slide would have increased 4%.
If you exclude the Visa/MasterCard settlement payments of $220 million that we received in the second quarter of 2011 and which were 0 this quarter total expenses would have decreased by 2%.
So I'll cover each of the individual line items on this slide and subsequent slides but I would point out that the effective tax rate this quarter of 29% reflects the realization of certain foreign tax credits this year.
And the 27% in the second quarter of '11 reflects the impact of favorable resolution of certain prior-year tax items.
A normal tax rate for us would be in the low 30s.
Looking at Slide 14 so this is marketing and promotion.
So on the prior slide we saw that in the second quarter of this year marketing and promotion was $773 million.
And that's down from 3% from $795 million in the second quarter of 2011 but it is up from $631 million in the first quarter of this year.
So we have said that our target for marketing promotion generally is to be around 9% of revenues so that we can drive growth.
In the first quarter when marketing and promotion was only 8.3% of revenues we said we had a plan for full year marketing promotion to be approximately 9%.
In this quarter we increased marketing promotion to 9.7% of revenues and we are continuing to invest in the business at healthy levels to drive growth and this puts us on track to achieve our plan of approximately 9% -- for marketing to be 9% for the full year of revenues.
If we move to Slide 15 so now we're now covering cardmember rewards expense.
So cardmember rewards expense for this quarter was $1 463 000 000 and that's down 9% from $1 613 000 000 in the second quarter of 2011.
Now the blue section of this bar represents MR points earned in the current period and co-brand expense.
I remind you that for co-brand products the co-brand partner has the obligation to deliver the reward.
We pay the co-brand partner each month for the amount we expense and have no balance sheet liability.
On the other hand we are responsible for delivering the rewards earned under the Membership Rewards program and had a balance sheet reserve of approximately $5 billion at the end of 2011.
The green section of the bar represents Membership Rewards expense related to points earned in previous periods due to an increase in the estimate of the ultimate redemption rate or a change in the estimate of the weighted average cost per point.
The green section in 2002 -- the green section in the second quarter of 2011 represents an increase in the ultimate redemption rate based on customer behavior and an increase in the weighted average cost per point in the second quarter of 2011.
Now you can see that there is no green section in the second quarter of 2012 as we had a modest increase in the ultimate redemption rate much low -- in the second quarter of this year much lower than the increase in the second quarter of 2011.
This quarter is much closer to historical levels of an increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the quarter.
But we did have an increase in that we created an expense in the quarter but it was offset by a reduction in the weighted average cost per point in this quarter which reduces expense in the quarter and the 2 items net to approximately 0.
Slide 16 operating expense performance and we have been very focused on this area.
On a reported basis total operating expense increased 10% in the quarter.
But if you exclude the Visa/MasterCard litigation settlement proceeds that are included in the second quarter of last year but are 0 this year it would have been a growth of 2%.
Now salaries and benefits decreased 4% compared to last year.
And that reflects the fact that in the second quarter of '11 we had a $48 million reengineering charge and in this quarter of 2012 we had the favorable impact of foreign exchange.
Our total employee count was approximately 64 000 and is relatively consistent with the prior year and last quarter.
If we look at professional services it's lower by 5% as last year had higher levels of technology costs.
If we look at occupancy and equipment it's up 14% and this reflects higher data processing costs related to software licenses and some higher rent.
If we look at adjusted other net of $422 million in the second quarter of '12 it increased significantly from $92 million in the second quarter of 2011 primarily reflecting the Visa/MasterCard settlement payment received in 2011.
In addition the increase includes accruals for refunds to customers as well as investment impairments.
As to the customer refunds we are discussing matters with our U.S.
banking regulators including those mentioned in the 10-K.
Based on those conversations and our own ongoing internal reviews we have made some changes to our CARD practices at our 2 banking subsidiaries: Centurion Bank and FSB.
The expense for these items is largely reflected in adjusted net other in this quarter.
Moving to Slide 17.
So this is 8 quarters of information on operating expense levels.
And we are at operating expense levels that we believe will enable us to drive business growth.
Going forward we will continue to implement our plans to contain operating expenditures.
As you can see operating expense was similar in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter.
Now I'm not making a forecast here but if operating expense stays at the current level the growth rate for the full year adjusted for the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds would be in the low single-digits and there's no change to our objective of growing operating expense more slowly than revenue growth over the next 2 to 3 years.
Slide 18.
So this is expense flexibility over time and this slide shows adjusted expenses as a percentage of revenues and adjusted expenses excludes credit provision.
So on the left side you can see 5 years of history and on the right side the past 5 quarters.
So both the first quarter and the second quarter of 2011 show improvement compared to the quarters in 2011.
And while the second quarter rounds to 71% it is slightly lower than in the first quarter.
Over time we expect this rate to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first through top-line revenue growth and second through expense flexibility which includes our plans to contain operating expense growth.
Moving to Slide 19 so these are our capital ratios.
Our Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of 2011 that's not on the slide was 12.3%.
It increased to 13.4% in the first quarter of this year as share repurchases did not start until mid-March after the Fed completed their review of our capital distribution plan.
In the second quarter we built capital with $1.3 billion of net income and $200 million related to employee plans.
And as planned we made capital distributions of $2 billion $1.8 billion in share repurchases and $200 million in dividends resulting in Tier 1 common moving to 2.8%.
The Tier 1 common ratio of 2.8% puts us in a strong capital position and well above required benchmarks.
Moving to Slide 20 so this is total payout ratios.
The left side you can see the ratios for the last 5 years and on the right for the past 4 quarters.
In the first quarter of 2012 as I just mentioned we didn't start share repurchases until mid-March.
So we only repurchased $200 million in the first quarter of this year.
The capital distribution plan allows for $4 billion in share repurchases in 2012 and we repurchased $1.8 billion in the second quarter to bring our year-to-date repurchases to $2 billion so half of the allowed repurchases at the midpoint of the year.
Slide 21 is our liquidity snapshot.
We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities.
So we have $16 billion in excess cash and marketable securities and the next 12 months of maturities is $15 billion.
So moving to Slide 22 so this is U.S.
retail deposits.
As we had limited cash needs in the second quarter and we issued $2.5 billion in unsecured debt and asset-backed securitizations we allowed deposits to decrease in the quarter by $1.7 billion but we remain committed to increase direct deposits over time.
So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.
Given the uncertain environment we feel positive about our financial performance in the second quarter including our ability to continue to grow earnings in the absence of settlement proceeds and with lower reserve releases.
Spending growth remained relatively strong albeit at a slower pace than recent quarters and we continue to grow faster than most of our large issuing competitors despite a more difficult prior-year comparison.
We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year with net yields comparable to the prior year leading to 4% growth in net interest income.
At the same time lending loss rates improved to new all-time lows.
Despite very strong credit performance provision expense increased as lending reserve releases were significantly lower this year than last year.
Our revenue growth of 5% or 7% on FX-adjusted basis reflects the benefits of our spend-centric mode and stands in contrast to many other issuers who still face year-over-year revenue declines.
In the quarter total expenses were well controlled at only 2% growth or 4% on an FX-adjusted basis.
We are still investing in the business and these investments are driving higher average spending and growth in the card base while continuing to build capabilities for the future.
Marketing and promotion though down slightly year-over-year represent 9.7% of revenues up from 8.3% last quarter.
In addition we are continuing to move forward with our plans to grow operating expenses more slowly than revenues over the next 2 to 3 years.
We also wanted to remind you that starting in the third quarter the impact on operating expense growth rates of losing the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds will decline significantly.
Our capital strength was also on display this quarter as we were able to elevate our year-to-date payout ratio to 83% while maintaining very strong capital ratios.
Looking ahead we recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead.
So thanks for listening and we are now going to take questions.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to inquire about performance on billed business so far in July.
And also if you could comment on -- just looking at domestic billed business seasonality would dictate growth link quarter around the 10% range we're a little off from that this quarter.
I was wondering if you could discuss any possible specific places where it might have weakened or if it was just general? Yes.
So I think we're not going to comment on July to-date numbers.
I would say though that in the second quarter the growth rate that we saw in June was very comparable to the growth rate that we saw in May.
In terms of categories I would say that we probably saw slower growth in T&amp;E categories than we saw in other categories.
But really the changing growth rates that we saw as I illustrated on the slides was really across all of our business lines  and really across all geographies.
So yes I would say it was pretty broad-based.
Research Division</strong> And if I can ask one follow-up.
Regarding the top line you had mentioned incentive payments as an offset in discount revenue.
We've heard that from you guys a couple of times now.
Is there any way that we could think about modeling that? And is it worth our time to figure out how to model that as an offset to pure discount revenue? So modeling always assumes that the future will be the same as the past if you use historical information.
We have had over the last several quarters higher levels of incentive payments.
Those are based on new agreements with many of our large corporate clients.
That is a business that has very high levels of profitability for us.
So despite the higher level of incentive payments sometimes which are triggered by new agreements sometimes triggered by corporate customers just spending at higher level.
And again we think they are effectively worthwhile investments because it is a business with very good profitability.
But the levels that we have from period to period will kind of depend on the growth in their spending and when contracts are removed.
And next we'll go to the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Dan just a follow-up on the prior question.
Just in terms of the spend volumes are you seeing any changes in terms of spending patterns both here and internationally whether it's moves from discretionary to nondiscretionary were there any changes throughout the quarter? Yes.
I don't know that there was big shift between discretionary and nondiscretionary.
I guess I would just point out that last year in the second quarter we grew 15%.
I don't know that any of our competitors grew at that level.
So to the extent you have that kind of growth when you come to the next year it's just a higher challenge in terms of growth rates.
So given those higher comparables I think our growth rates remain healthy and are reflective of the fact that the investments that we've made over the past couple of years continue to pay off.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just on the capital so you've now repurchased $2 billion for the year and I'm guessing some of this quarter was a catch-up from last quarter but how do we think about for it over the next 3 quarters given what your CCAR allotment is? And I know you've talked in the past about having some safer acquisitions but it seems like we've been pretty quiet on that front.
So I just want to think about how we should think about the path over the next 2 or 3 quarters.
And second now that we've gotten the NPR from the regulators any sense of what the all-in Basel III capital level looks like? Okay.
So as you say from the balance of the year we have approvement based on our submission to buy back $2 billion more through the end of the year.
We could afford to do modest levels of acquisitions and still buy back $2 billion more.
If we had acquisitions at higher levels then we would moderate the buybacks accordingly which is I think very consistent with what we've said our plan would be as we to go through the course of this year.
So no really -- no change there.
In terms of new Basel information what I remind you of is that we have our ratios calculated under Basel I right? We are still in the process of developing what they would be under Basel II so we don't have that information yet.
But the impact in this quarter of going from Basel I to Basel III is approximately 30 basis points.
It varies from quarter-to-quarter but has generally been in the kind of 20- to 80-basis-points range depending on quarter.
This quarter it was about 30 basis points.
And our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup.
Research Division</strong> Dan I hope you could talk a little bit about post the MOU merchant settlement if you can kind of remind us what you allow in terms of surcharging and what the potential impact might be going forward? Okay.
So I think as most people know we were not party to that litigation.
That lawsuit was filed against Visa and MasterCard and they control about 70% or 80% of the market.
A fundamental legal difference is -- between us and Visa/MasterCard is that they have market power.
The courts have recognized this and determined that they used that power improperly.
American Express does not have market power.
We continue to believe that there's no merit to the separate merchant cases that we are involved in and we believe that we have strong legal defenses.
Now as it relates to surcharging surcharging is not consumer-friendly.
The terms and conditions within the settlement agreement that deal with surcharging are very complicated.
So given that complexity we think it's too early to know what the impact of the rule changes might actually have in the marketplaces but we obviously will monitor the situation and respond appropriately.
Now we've seen different reactions in different international markets where surcharging is allowed by law.
In Australia some merchants have introduced surcharging.
It was first allowed there back in 2003 and we've been able to respond effectively and continue to operate successfully.
In contrast in the U.K.
we've seen very little evidence of merchants surcharging and that was first allowed by the Thatcher government many many years ago.
The other thing I'd point out and you should keep in mind is that in the United States there are 10 states that have laws that prohibit surcharging and these states represent about 50% of our U.S.
billings volume.
So the Visa/MasterCard rule change doesn't change the terms of our contracts with merchants.
We do not prevent merchants from surcharging but we do continue to require parity treatment so that our cardmembers are not discriminated against at point of sale.
And by parity treatment I mean that if a American Express cardmember is surcharged 100 basis points any other credit card that is presented would be charged -- surcharged the same 100 basis points.
And next we'll go to the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> I was -- you pointed out in your earlier remarks that the total cards-in-force have been growing quite a bit more in the network partner area I believe you stated 15% versus 2% proprietary.
Can you dimensionalize maybe the differences in the customer base for network partner card versus the proprietary card? What you expect in terms of spend on a partner card versus a proprietary card anything that we could -- let us maybe better forecast the overall growth on that line.
Okay.
So GNS partners when we speak to them their products are targeted to their more affluent customers.
That's really the design of the product.
It's designed to encourage spending so they are more affluent customers.
Now I would say that the average spend within GNS partner customers is lower than the average spend in proprietary American Express cards.
But we see the GNS business as a terrific business for us in that it brings more cardmembers into merchants so it makes the American Express network more relevant in more markets.
And often these are customers that we would not be able to reach other than through the GNS partner relationships.
Today GNS has grown over the years to be a important contributor to income.
Now while the dollar profit that we earn on each dollar of GNS-billed business is lower than what we earn on a dollar of proprietary billed business it requires very little capital and so the returns are good.
The other thing I'd point out is that some of the -- that many of the GNS partnerships operate in both -- some markets are developed markets and some are developing markets so you need to take that into consideration as well.
But net-net we think it is a good business overall in terms of the contribution and mix.
Research Division</strong> Yes.
And so just as a follow-up I guess we just need to think about how that's going to impact the discount revenues versus overall spend.
Also I -- if I remember correctly the network cards are mostly on a credit card platform versus a charge card platform.
Is that correct? Yes.
I mean so their products and our products run on our network right? The cards that the GNS partners issue are often credit cards so that's a difference.
But they run on our -- they don't work -- run on a different network.
It's the American Express network.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And maybe just if I could get one last one.
On the refunds that your -- that you took the charge on for in the quarter can you expand on that at all? We've seen some other peers that have taken similar charges and I guess I'd just like to better understand what those refunds are.
Yes.
So these are -- relate to certain changes that we've made in our CARD practices and the changes generally relate to items around either pricing exposure or collections.
So that's a -- that gives you a little bit more flavor in terms of the changes we're making that led to the refunds that we're making to customers.
And our next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.
Research Division</strong> Just as you pointed out billed business during the quarter slowed across the board and across all platforms.
So I'm just wondering you also reiterated the desire to kind of continue to generate positive operating leverage.
Just curious how much flexibility there is if we assume a further slowdown in billed business given the global economic outlook how much room there is to still continue to cut costs or accelerate the decline in costs? Yes.
So I think when we talk about our desire to contain operating expense it's really a long-term view.
So it's not just related to this quarter or next quarter or related to a potential slowdown.
I think it's really a desire to create operating leverage so that expenses are growing at an appropriate level that enable us to have the investment dollars that we desire so that we can drive business over the long term and achieve our financial targets on an average and over time.
So the whole notion of operating leverage is really designed as a long-term objective and not necessarily related to a short-term slowdown.
We also could react if there was a severe short-term slowdown the way we have historically when there's been a recession.
But I would think of those as really really 2 different types of focuses on operating expense.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So I mean given -- assuming a modest slowdown in billed business growth you'd still expect to generate operating leverage? It's our goal to continue to generate operating leverage from where we are today yes.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just as a follow-up and you mentioned before M&amp;A if you do anything that's I guess not large you still have limited buyback as well.
Where are you seeing -- I mean you haven't done anything recently but where are you seeing the opportunities and where are you focused on M&amp;A? Yes.
I think M&amp;A we would focus on what I'd describe as kind of bolt-on acquisitions not very large acquisitions.
They would be to enable us to achieve our strategic business objectives and/or be in something that's a very close adjacency.
Loyalty partners is a good example of that where they had a coalition loyalty platform in -- primarily in Germany but in several other countries we have a significant amount of loyalty experience and we have global reach and we thought that was a very good combination.
And we'd generally be in areas that would generate fee business going forward.
So those would be the general parameters of what we're endeavoring to achieve.
And our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel Nicolaus.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just want to get a little more color if you can Dan on the spending trends.
I believe you said that June levels were similar to May levels and it's a little early to get into July.
But just looking at the June and May I was under the impression that your last public update in June call I think it was guided to 9% to10% billed business growth through May.
So I'm just trying to reconcile how it slowed all the way down to 7% with just the month of June if June was in line with May.
Do I have those numbers right? So I think you have the numbers right.
But the 9% to 10% that we related to April and May were FX-adjusted.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So right in line then.
The comparable number is 9% for the quarter.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
Right in line okay.
And then the second question would be on the expense side just getting a little more color on the HR costs salaries and benefits line.
The first time you've had a negative growth rate there since '09.
I think you did call out the reengineering but even if I adjust for reengineering it's still down on a year-over-year basis versus up 7-plus percent in the first quarter.
Anything else that helped cut costs this quarter on a personnel side?  Is it lower bonus accruals that go along with this lower spending or anything else that was one-time in nature that helped the OpEx growth slow so much on the PL -- personnel line? Yes.
So I think if you back out the reengineering you kind of get close to flat.
And then really we were helped as all the expense lines were by FX.
So if you look at total -- I don't know if it's exactly in salaries and benefits but on the total it took the growth rate from total expense to the growth rate from 2% up to 4%.
So if you had a similar relationship on salaries and benefits it would be up about 2% which is in the realm of what you would expect if you have a constant employee base.
And what we had in this quarter was similar to what we had in the second quarter of last year in terms of total number of employees.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then one final one on the spending side again.
Some of those growth rates you gave us for some of the countries within the eurozone.
Any color you can give us on how much those have changed and how much of a slowdown you're seeing in countries like Spain or Italy or Germany? Yes.
I think we gave last quarter similar numbers and I would venture to say that the countries in Southern Europe if I remember correctly -- let's see I actually have some data here so let's see.
So I would say each of the countries decreased by 2% or 3% not much different than what we're seeing overall.
Spain decreased a little bit more than that compared to last quarter.
I think we said Spain was up 2% in the second -- first quarter this year.
So not wide variation other than Spain.
Basically the same kind of trends that we're seeing across the world.
And next we'll go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.
Research Division</strong> Dan I believe you said that in the past that you think the 12% range is conservatively the Tier 1 common level that you see Amex operating at given the uncertainties surrounding Basel II.
12% seems kind of high to me but I wonder if you can just give us some updated thoughts there in terms of what the right Tier 1 common ratio is that we should be thinking about as your target level going forward.
So initially when we're coming out of the recession we said we want to be at least 10% or 11%.
I think over the course of the past couple of years we've had good capital generation.
And really in 2011 we kind of increased from that 11% range up to the 12% range because in our submission to the Fed in January of '11 we only asked for $2.3 billion of buybacks on the assumption that we were going to use half of the capital generated to do acquisitions which would mean we'd do $2 billion in acquisitions.
In fact that year we only did $1 billion.
So we effectively wound up as a result of that of retaining another $1 billion and that took us from 11 up to 12%.
I think we taken artificially high in the first quarter because we couldn't do share buybacks in the first quarter of '12 until our plan was approved.
That was in the middle of March.
So I'd expect to see us to trend back towards where we were at the beginning of this year which was 12.3%.
We think our submission was appropriate in terms of the levels of buybacks that we requested.
And the fact that the Fed approved that level I think is a demonstration of our financial strength and flexibility.
So this will evolve over time and each year we'll probably get better insight in terms of where we want to be.
And as we move forward with the work that we're doing on Basel II which we may not have better insights until we get to 2014 but when we get those better insights we'll have a better sense of where we want just to settle in.
Now the other thing I think that's important is not just a raw number that your Tier 1 common ratio is but if you look at the stress test and see where your ratio is after that stress may start to become even more important.
And certainly if you look at the data from this year you can see that based on the stress test that the Fed decided the assumptions on we had very limited drop in where the Tier 1 common was in that stress which was different than many others.
So I think people start to look at that.
And that will be something we'll have to consider when we ultimately set where we decide to hold Tier 1 common ratio.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And as a follow-up can you talk about what happened with the bluebird product at Walmart? If you just give a little bit more color there? And I believe you guys have talked about the -- converging all of your prepaid offerings under one platform.
I believe that was the Serve platform.
Can you update us on where we are on that and whether that's -- bluebird had anything to do with that convergence? So we do have a plan to move our reloadable prepaid product onto the Serve platform within the next couple of quarters.
That doesn't have anything to do with bluebird but it is a excellent use of the Serve platform for business that we think will be growing and a business where we think we have a very good product in the marketplace compared to the competitions.
So as it relates to bluebird American Express and Walmart have a great partnership.
Our work together on bluebird has moved to a new phase and we continue to test different points of distribution and marketing messages while also collecting and analyzing feedback for customers who took part in our pilot.
And at this time it wouldn't make sense to speak about any future plans with bluebird but we appreciate your interest around the bluebird project.
And next we'll go to the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Have you got any specific plans to reduce the cost per point and how to think about that as we go forward? So I think the cost per point is something that we're focused on just in terms of -- so the offerings that we put into the program are designed to create value for our customers.
We have over 100 different options within the program that are part of what make it an excellent program.
And certainly as we think about adding customers and options we do think about the overall costs to us.
So it's a balance between value to our customers who participate in the Membership Rewards program and the cost of the program in terms of the overall economics of the products that we offer.
So for years we've been focused on the cost per point and endeavored to manage it and we will continue to do that as we go forward.
In this period it was really not a result of changing the offerings within the program.
It was really driven by customer behavior and a change in mix.
So in this quarter we just had a shift in mix really away from the amount that was being redeemed for airlines compared to what we have had in prior quarters.
And that's what really drove the weighted average cost per point down in this given period.
Research Division</strong> And I know you said before that you don't strive for the lowest loss rate but rather kind of an economic answer.
But could you talk a little about why you've got kind 50- 60-basis-point increase in charge card losses in the first half of this year versus first half of last year? Yes.
So our strategy is to focus on growing spend products so those would be charge cards as well as premium lending cards.
So as we strove to grow the charge business to see write-off rates go up a bit is perfectly fine with us as long as we're attracting customer groups that have good long-term economics.
And as you know when you're bringing a lending customer sometimes it takes 12 to 24 months before the portfolio seasons because people can make minimum payments.
In charge card on the other hand it's a pay-in-full product so you see it a lot more quickly.
So I think that's part of what drove the increase that we saw through the first quarter.
On the other hand we continue to get focused on what's taking place within our portfolio.
And I think that focus is what enabled the write-off rate actually to come down in the second quarter compared to the first.
But still all-in these are very low write-off rates.
And if we can drive the right economics and acquire the right customers having write-off rates being higher than where they are today are perfectly fine.
Research Division</strong> Great.
Just one last very quick thing and that is the ancillary products that you mentioned in -- are those sold through a third party or do you sell them directly? So which ancillary products? Research Division</strong> The ones that you're talking about having customer rebates before.
I -- so I know -- so I don't know the specific answer to that question.
I know we have been focusing on them and I suspect that at least a portion of them I think are sold through our proprietary process.
But I don't have a specific split between what's proprietary and what might be with third parties.
And next we'll go to the line of Mike Taiano with Telsey Advisory Group.
So I just wanted to make sure that I understood your question -- the answer on the surcharging question.
So as I understand it so if Visa and MasterCard were to charge let's just say 2% -- or if merchants were to charge 2% on a Visa/MasterCard transaction your rules would not allow merchants to charge a higher amount than that even if your cost of acceptance to the merchant is higher? Our provision does not prohibit surcharging but requires that the surcharging be on a parity basis so that our cardmembers are not discriminated against at the point of sale.
So if someone was charging 2% to our customers then our contracts would require that any other credit card that's presented would be required to have the same surcharge.
Okay.
So it's -- they would then have to charge MasterCard or Visa cardholders the same as they're charging you and not vice versa? No.
So our contracts cover our cardmembers right? The Visa and MasterCard rules cover theirs.
So if a merchant has a contract with us it requires that our cardmembers be charged on parity as I just described with what -- and that other credit card companies -- other credit cards that are presented would have to have the same surcharge.
Okay got it.
And then just one follow-up on a -- I saw you guys are adopting the EMV standards.
Was just curious what you think that impact will be if there is a additional costs that you'll have to incur later this year or early next year on that? So we're going to start issuing cards that have EMV enabled and we will convert cards over over a multiyear period.
So the cost of doing that will not be in 1 or 2 quarters but would be over a several year period.
Next we'll go to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Research Division</strong> The -- just a comment on the long-term growth model revenue and earnings growth model if you can.
I mean obviously your targets are at least 8% revenue growth and 12% to 15% earnings growth.
And I think ken suggested looking at 2010 is kind of a base.
As we look forward to 2013 and '14 it doesn't seem like the economic trajectory is going to change all that much from here.
It certainly doesn't feel like it today.
But are you able to --  do you feel good about being able to hit those targets? I mean you're blowing out your return on equity target pretty significantly.
But can you hit those -- the revenue and EPS? Do you feel confident in those targets? So on average and over time I would think about a 10-year cycle not a 3- or 4-year cycle.
And clearly in times where economic growth is slow you would expect to have slower billed business growth in those periods than when you had a robust period.
So when we say on average and over time I think we've looked at it an extended cycle.
And over that cycle I think we're confident that we can achieve those levels we can achieve our financial targets.
Research Division</strong> And then on spend growth I mean your -- you had Continental.
How much of an effect has Continental's switch to United had on your billed business? So we had a fair number of initiatives in place last year when the Continental contract expired.
We actually were very pleased in terms of what we are able to achieve in terms of retaining customers through those initiatives at the end of the day.
And what I would point out is I don't have any specific data on how many customers we may have lost but what I would say is over the past year we have continued to build share in the U.S.
So in total we've continued to be successful in the marketplace when you look at the overall population of people who could -- who are using credit and charge cards.
And these days that's our aim is to be successful in terms of financial results and continuing to be able to compete successfully in the marketplace.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just a last question on Serve if I could.
If you could give some update I mean you've invested -- I mean American Express has invested at least several hundred million dollars to date in Serve and I know that we haven't seen as many new relationships being announced recently but when can we get some -- I mean some information on how successful Serve is being? It seems looking at your numbers and the growth of fee income it really still seems to be pretty irrelevant and it's hard to forecast any benefit from that significant investment that you've been making over these last several years.
Yes.
So I think -- last year was the year we wanted to sign agreements with other businesses that would put Serve in the path of their customers.
This year it's all about getting customers onto the network and that's what we're focused on.
So that's our focus now.
In terms of Serve we are seeing some successful uses of Serve.
Certainly by putting our reloadable products on Serve if we didn't have that platform our ability to issue the product would have been hampered.
We have also entered into agreements in China with Lianlian where the basis of that is that Lianlian is going to use the Serve platform as part of their mobile pop-up process.
So we are seeing spots we're able to use it.
I don't think we're at the point yet where we would release financial information but we continue to make progress against the objectives that we have set for ourselves.
Research Division</strong> And then I guess as that relates to your fee income targets I mean it seems like you're still quite a ways away from hitting your targets on fee income and it seems like you need to make acquisitions to grow that.
Or are you disappointed with the level of fee income growth that you've been able to generate given the aggressive target? Yes.
So our target is to exit I think 2014 at a $3 billion run rate.
Last year we had $1.3 billion in fee income.
So we continue to make progress in the fee area and against that target.
So to the operator I would say I'll take one last question.
And that would be from Brad Ball with Evercore.
Research Division</strong> Dan what was the amount of the accrual for refunds in the quarter? And had you accrued any in prior quarters? So we did have an accrual back in the fourth quarter which we mentioned at that time.
As it relates to the accruals in this quarter we don't plan to disclose the exact dollar amount.
We felt that the cost in this quarter were important enough to mention but not large enough to quantify.
Research Division</strong> The adjusted other rose by $110 million year-over-year.
Is most of that driven by this accrual? So I would say that there were 2 items that contributed to it.
It was this accrual as well as investment impairments that drove it.
So those are the 2 big items that are in the increase.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then separately you continue to show spending on lending products that are growing faster than your overall loan growth and at the same time you've got historically strong credit quality.
And I'm just wondering when will you start pushing a little harder on loan growth and driving up your net charge-off ratio to a more economically reasonable level? At down at 2.2% it just seems too low to drive the kind of returns and spending volume growth that you have the potential to get here.
So we have never had a target to grow loans and I don't anticipate that we will in the future.
Our focus is to make investments that have good economic returns over time and they are currently focused on charge card as well as premium lending.
So to the extent customers want have the ability to lend and we have the right credit quality then we want to put investments up against both charge and premium lending and to the extent we're successful we will -- may see loan growth increase but we don't have any specific targets for loan growth.
We really target our investments for the greatest economic return over time.
Research Division</strong> And what would you say is a normalized net charge-off rate? A normalized charge-off rate.
So that's what we're going to have to wait and see all right? So over the past 10 years it was about 4.5%.
So I feel pretty confident not going too much out on a limb that it will be less than that going forward.
But exactly where it will go from here will be very dependent on both our strategy as well as customer behavior at the end of the day.
All right.
All right.

Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release.
[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I'll now turn the conference over to your host Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you Kathy.
Welcome.
We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion.
The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2011 10-K and Q1 and Q2 2012 10-Q reports already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2012 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides including -- included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dan completes his remarks we will move to Q&amp;A.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay.
Thanks Rick.
And I'll start on Slide 2 the summary of financial performance.
So total revenues net of interest expense came in at $7.9 billion.
That's an increase of 4% from a year ago.
On an FX-adjusted basis that's 5% growth.
If we look back to the second quarter reported revenue growth was 5%; FX-adjusted 7%.
So there's a slightly lower growth rate in revenues in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.
Pretax income was $1.9 billion 9% growth.
Net income came in at $1.3 billion or 1% growth.
So net income is growing at a slower pace than pretax income and that's due to a lower tax rate in the third quarter of 2011.
Diluted EPS came in at $1.09.
That's an increase of 6%.
So EPS is growing at a faster pace than net income due to our share buyback program.
Return on equity is 26% slightly above our target of 25%.
And shares outstanding decreased by 4% and this is also related to the share buyback program.
So moving to Slide 3.
These are the third quarter metrics.
Billed business came in at $220 billion.
That's 6% higher than the quarter a year ago 8% on an FX-adjusted basis.
If we compare that to the second quarter in the second quarter we had reported billed business growth of 7% and 9% on an FX-adjusted basis.
So the third quarter billings growth rates were slightly below the second quarter by approximately 100 basis points which seems consistent with the broader pattern of decline seen recently by others in the industry.
Total cards in force grew 6%.
That's a growth of 2% in our proprietary cards which is consistent with what we've seen over the last several quarters and a growth in GNS cards of 13%.
Average basic cardmember spending grew at 4% and this is reflective of strong customer engagement.
Cardmember Loans came in at $61 billion.
That's a growth of 6%.
In the second quarter we had growth of 4%.
If we move over to Slide 4 so this is billed business growth by segment.
And we see a slight decline across each segment in terms of growth rates.
If you look at GCS the green line which is Global Corporate Services it previously had a growth rate above the company average over the first half of 2012 and it has declined at a slightly faster growth rate to move more towards the industry average.
And we've seen this slower growth rate primarily in T&amp;E categories.
If you look at Slide 5 this is billed business growth by region.
And again here we see a slight decline across each region although a slightly faster decline in JAPA.
And within this segment we saw a slowdown in the growth rate in Australia and that's having the largest impact on that region's growth.
If we move to Slide 6 so this is a new slide.
The bars are the dollar level of loans in each quarter and the line is the growth rate in loans compared to the prior year quarter.
So while Cardmember Loan growth rate has gradually increased over the past several quarters loans at $61.8 billion this quarter are well below the peak levels of $77.1 billion that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Loan growth of 6% in the second quarter compares to 8% growth in spending on lending products.
If we move to Slide 7 so this is revenue performance.
And if we look at total revenue growth which is in the bottom right-hand corner came in at 4%.
That'll be 5% on an FX-adjusted basis.
If we compare that to the second quarter reported revenue growth was 5% or 7% on an FX-adjusted basis.
So this quarter we are growing slightly -- at a slightly slower pace than in the second quarter.
Discount revenue is driven by a 6% increase in billed business offset by higher contra-revenues primarily cash back rewards.
I also note that the average discount rate decreased slightly to 2.53% and that compares to 2.54% in the third quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012.
And as we've discussed before it's being driven by pricing initiatives mix and volume pricing.
If we look at net card fees increased 2%.
And this growth matches the growth in cards in force.
If we look at travel commissions and fees it decreased 3% and is reflecting a 6% decline in worldwide travel sales again reflecting lower T&amp;E spending.
Other commissions and fees declined 4% but was flat on an FX-adjusted basis.
Other revenue is up 8% and it primarily reflects a $30-million gain on the sale of ICBC shares.
Net interest income growth was 6% reflecting a 4% increase in average Cardmember Loans and slightly higher net interest yield.
Moving to Slide 8 provision for losses.
So the provision increased by $230 million.
At a high level we are seeing lower reserve releases partially offset by lower write-offs.
So looking at Charge Card provision it increased 9%.
So this reflects a growth in receivables of 6% compared to last year.
Credit metrics as we'll see in a minute are relatively stable.
We had a reserve build in the third quarter of this year of $17 million and that compares to a $27-million release last year.
So modest changes in reserves.
Cardmember Loan provision reflects loans growing 6% compared to last year.
The delinquency rate is flat compared to the second quarter and we continue to see declines in the write-off rate leading to a reserve release in the quarter.
But as you can see on the slide reserve releases this quarter of this year were $88 million compared to $421 million in the third quarter of 2011.
So this has the effect of increasing provision year-over-year.
And it was partially offset by lower write-offs.
Write-off dollars in this quarter were $328 million and that compares to $427 million in the third quarter of 2011.
So provision is increasing while credit metrics are either stable or improving.
If we move to Slide 9 so this is the Charge Card credit performance.
And on the left you can see the U.S.
consumer charge write-off rate.
They ticked up slightly in the first quarter of this year but have now ticked down slightly this quarter.
I would view this as stable performance over the last several quarters.
The right chart is international consumer and Global Corporate Services.
As you can see on the chart the net loss ratio is stable.
And also note that these are historically low credit metrics.
If we move to Slide 10 this is lending credit performance.
And on the left-hand side you can see that lending write-off rate continues to trend down in the quarter.
Within the quarter each month was basically stable at either 2% or 1.9%.
Our view is that we are at or near a low point for the lending write-off rate.
Our 30-day past due billings percentage trended down slightly in this month to 1.3%.
And as I say each quarter our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate but to achieve the best economic gain where we make investments.
These metrics are at historic lows and represent the best credit metrics in the industry.
Moving to Slide 11.
This is our lending reserve coverage.
And so for both the U.S.
and worldwide reserves as a percentage of loans continue to come down as write-off rates and 30-day past due rates improve.
Reserves as a percentage of past due have trended down as well for the same reason.
Principal months coverage have ticked up a bit primarily due to the low level of write-offs in the quarter.
We think reserves are appropriately stated based on our credit reserve models.
Looking at expenses Slide 12.
So if you look at total expenses at the bottom right total expenses are 2% lower than in the third quarter of last year and that'll be 1% lower on an FX-adjusted basis.
Adjusted to exclude litigation settlement payments of $70 million in the third quarter of 2011 expenses would be down 3%.
I will cover the individual lines on following slides but I would note that our effective tax rate is at 33% this year compared to 28% in the third quarter of 2011 when we realized certain foreign tax credits.
Moving to Slide 13.
So marketing expense on Slide 12 indicated that marketing expense was $764 million in the third quarter of this year compared to $757 million in the third quarter of 2011.
So that's only a 1% increase.
So you could ask a question is that a sufficient increase in marketing to drive our business growth? In fact we have high levels of spending in both quarters.
You can see marketing as a percentage of revenues in this quarter was 9.7%.
We have indicated that we think marketing at 9% of revenues will enable us to drive business growth.
So we are investing at healthy levels to drive future growth.
If we move to Slide 14 so this is cardmember rewards expense.
So cardmember rewards expense as set forth on Slide 12 in the third quarter of this year was $1.496 billion.
And that compares to $1.565 billion in the third quarter of 2011.
So rewards expense is 4% lower than it was a year ago.
As you can see from the chart this is a combination of higher expense in the third quarter of this year related to higher MR rewards earned in the current period and higher co-brand expense -- that's the blue section of the bar -- but lower rewards expense related to the change in MR liability for points previously earned.
So the increase in the URR in the third quarter of 2012 is lower than the increase in the URR in the third quarter of 2011.
The net of these factors is lower rewards expense in this quarter compared to a year ago.
The increase in the URR in the third quarter of this year is more in line with historic levels.
The higher increase in URR in the third quarter of 2011 resulted from increased redemptions in that period.
So let me remind you that for co-brand products the co-brand partner has the obligation to deliver the reward.
We pay the co-brand partner each month the amount we expense and have no balance sheet liability.
On the other hand we are responsible for delivering the rewards earned under the Membership Reward program and have a balance sheet reserve which was approximately $5 billion at the end of 2011.
So let's move to Slide 15 and let me remind you how the 2 elements of MR expense are calculated each quarter.
So at the top for points earned in the period we took a look at total spending on products with the Membership Rewards feature as well as any bonus points related to that spending and we multiply it times the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point calculated for that quarter.
The second piece is expense for points earned in previous periods.
And when we have a change in the ultimate redemption rate or the weighted average cost per point we apply those to all points outstanding at the beginning of the period.
And that's the green portion of the bar.
And it happened to be a small amount in the third quarter of 2012.
Now while -- as we have said many times rewards and loyalty programs continue to be a major competitive advantage for us.
They drive billings they have significant positive impacts on credit quality and they result in closer longer-lasting relationships with our cardmembers.
We periodically evaluate the process for estimating the ultimate redemption rate and refine this process from time to time in response to changes in cardmember behavior and other factors.
We currently have a review of our U.S.
ultimate redemption rate estimation process underway.
This review should be completed by the end of the year and will likely lead to a fourth quarter charge.
As you know our current ultimate redemption rate is 93% a very high assumption for any consumer loyalty program.
As with any such program there are always going to be some breakage when participants leave the program without redeeming all the points they have earned.
And as I said the review of our ultimate redemption rate estimation process is not yet complete.
I don't have any estimate to offer you today but I did want to let you know that we have this process underway.
Moving to Slide 16.
So this is operating expense performance.
And as you can see in the lower right-hand part of the chart operating expense in the third quarter of this year is 2% lower than the third quarter of 2011.
Adjusted to exclude the litigation settlement it would be 4% lower than the third quarter of 2011.
So this is clearly delivering on our objective of growing operating expense more slowly than revenues.
Looking at salaries and benefits it is lower by 5%.
This is benefiting slightly from FX and in the third quarter of 2011 included higher reengineering costs.
Our employee count this year is consistent with our employee count in the third quarter of last year.
You can see that professional services are flat.
Occupancy and equipment is up 5% reflecting higher data processing costs.
And adjusted other is lower as a result of expense related to legal exposures booked in the third quarter of 2011.
Now in this quarter we established incremental reserves for customer refunds within adjusted other net as well as several different revenue P&amp;L line items.
These reserves were not the primary driver of year-over-year variances in any of the single P&amp;L line items that they hit.
Earlier this month the company announced that we had reached settlement with several regulatory agencies.
Reserves were established in prior quarters for a substantial portion of these fines and estimated cardmember refunds.
We are continuing our own internal review and also cooperating with regulators in their ongoing examination of add-on products in accordance with an industry-wide review.
Let me move to Slide 17.
So this is a new slide.
We used it at the August Financial Community Meeting.
So the green line is the growth in operating expense the blue line is the growth in revenues and the dotted green line is the growth in operating expense excluding litigation settlement payments.
So let me make several points.
The growth rates in 2010 and early 2011 were the result of our strategy to invest in business utilizing reserve releases and the settlement proceeds.
In 2012 we stated our objective to grow operating expenses more slowly than revenue growth over the next 2 to 3 years.
In the fourth quarter of '11 and the first and second quarter of 2012 excluding the settlement proceeds we grew operating expense slower than revenues.
This quarter adjusted operating expense and reported operating expense are lower than they were in the third quarter of 2011 and are growing slower than revenues.
This demonstrates our ability to effectively control operating expense.
Moving to Slide 18.
So this is expense as a percentage of revenues and it shows adjusted expense.
Adjusted expense excludes credit provision.
On the left-hand side we see 5 years of history and on the right-hand side the past 5 quarters.
Over time we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first through top line revenue growth; and second through expense flexibility which includes our plan to contain operating expense growth.
Moving to Slide 18 (sic) [Slide 19] capital ratios.
Tier 1 common ratio came in at 12.7% this quarter which is similar to where we were in the second quarter of this year.
We generated $1.4 billion in capital this quarter $1.3 billion from net income plus $100 million from employee plans.
We distributed $1.2 billion in capital $1 billion in share buybacks and $200 million in dividends in the quarter.
Risk-weighted assets increased somewhat due mostly to higher accounts receivable and loans.
Our Tier 1 common ratio of 12.7% puts us in a strong capital position and well above required benchmarks.
Moving to Slide 20 the total payout ratio.
So this is a percentage of capital generated return to shareholders.
The left side is the past 5 years and the right side are the past 4 quarters.
Our capital distribution plan allows for up to $4 billion in share repurchases in 2012.
Over the first 3 quarters of 2012 we have repurchased $3 billion.
We are maintaining very strong capital ratios while making these distributions.
Moving to Slide 21.
So this is a liquidity snapshot.
We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities.
We have $18 billion in excess cash and marketable securities and the next 12 months of funding maturities is $16 billion.
Moving to Slide 22.
So this is our U.S.
retail deposits by type.
So we increased total deposits in the quarter by $1.2 billion up to $37 billion.
Direct deposits increased by $1.3 billion and third-party CDs decreased slightly.
We remain committed to increasing direct deposits over time.
So with that let me conclude with a few comments.
Given the uncertain environment we feel positive about our financial performance including our ability to continue to grow EPS in the third quarter in the absence of settlement payments and with significantly lower reserve releases.
Spending growth continues to be healthy despite the uneven economy.
Third quarter billings growth rate was slightly below the prior quarters which seemed consistent with the broader pattern of decline seen recently by others in the industry.
We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year leading to 6% growth in net interest income.
At the same time lending loss rates improved to new all-time lows.
Despite very strong credit performance provision expense increased as lending reserve releases were significantly lower this year than last year.
Revenue growth of 4% or 5% on an FX-adjusted basis slowed somewhat versus prior quarters and reflects the impact of a weaker economic environment.
This stands in contrast to many other issuers who still face year-over-year declines.
In the quarter we demonstrated notable expense discipline with operating expense declining 2% versus the prior year.
This is consistent with our plan of growing operating expense more slowly than revenues over the next 2 to 3 years.
We are still investing in the business and these investments are driving higher average spending and growth in the card base while continuing to build capabilities for the future.
This was evidenced by marketing and promotion expense representing 9.7% of revenues this quarter which is above our historic average of 9%.
Our strong capital strength was also displayed this quarter as we were able to elevate our year-to-date payout ratio to 86% while maintaining very strong capital ratios.
Looking ahead we recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead.
Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just in terms of billed business can you give us a sense of how it progressed throughout the quarter? I know that it was 7% at the Analyst Day on a days-adjusted basis and it obviously came in a little bit stronger than that.
And then second just in terms of the European franchise it was up 3%.
In the quarter can you give us a sense of how that looked by country? Did you see any weakness beyond Spain and Italy? So as you said we disclosed that on an FX and days mix adjusted.
It was 7% in July.
So we're up slightly from there.
So obviously the last 2 months were a little stronger than July.
But I would say it was pretty even over those 2 remaining months.
So there's not a trend going in either direction.
In terms of Europe -- sorry we had some background noise there.
In terms of Europe I think it's slightly slower growth than we saw last quarter.
Notwithstanding that it is down slightly but still at 3%.
So again we're seeing some slowdown really across Europe so no major change in terms of how the various countries are performing on a relative basis to each other.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just in terms of -- can you just give us a little bit more color on the review of the IRR [ph] what drove it? What are the some of the key changes in your estimates that lead you to believe that there could be a charge taken? Yes.
The -- I think in the normal course we periodically think it's appropriate to review the estimation process.
It's generally driven by behavior changes by customers or as we collect more information.
So in the first quarter of 2011 we made a change in the estimation process.
Previous to that we had only used attriter information people who had left the program to estimate the ultimate redemption rate for the active participants.
At that juncture we started to incorporate information from active participants.
And so after that we thought we would monitor it and we thought it was appropriate at this juncture to do an evaluation of the estimation process.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And if I could just sneak one last question in in terms of the add-on products can you give us any sense of what percentage of revenue this is? And have you made any changes to the products that you're offering? Have you shut down any of the selling of any of these products? So like everybody else in the industry we know that regulators had a concern about them.
So we stopped marketing earlier in the year and we'll no longer offer Account Protector or ID Protect products as of December 31 of this year.
And I'd point out that these products are not a significant source of revenue to us.
Your next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> Back on that URR question I was just wondering have you guys considered possibly making changes to your programs such that to influence the URR lower? I mean or is it -- is there something that precludes you from doing that like competition and market share loss? And then secondarily I was just wondering on the Walmart partnership and others.
I was just wondering what the P&amp;L implications are just so -- I assume that there's some kind of revenue share agreement.
I mean do those get accounted for in the marketing line? And -- or are they contra-revenue items? So Membership Rewards we view as being a competitive advantage to us.
As I said they are an important part of driving billings.
It also is a way for us to have a very close relationship to our customers.
So it's a key element.
It's not the only element.
Certainly cardmember benefits and superior servicing are all part of our value proposition but Membership Rewards is a program that we think is the best in the industry.
We actually think to the extent we enhance the program and we have higher redemptions that that will have a very positive impact on the long-term health of our business.
So at this juncture we're not thinking of any initiatives -- wholesale initiatives to change the value proposition and drive the ultimate redemption rate down.
If it continues to increase and drive billings in the future then we would view that as a positive.
In terms of Walmart -- so Walmart we will from that product earn certain discount rate at the prepaid discount rate.
We also will earn some float on the balances.
There are no rewards costs related to this.
There may be some minimal credit-type losses.
There are actually no credit losses but there could be some fraud losses.
And really what we need to do is grow this so that we can scale this and take advantage of what is a relatively low fixed-base cost related to this product.
So that's what I would say in terms of what you should expect in the future in terms of what lines it will hit.
We will go next to Mark DeVries with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Dan as we get closer to the next CCAR process after a year in which you didn't really deploy any significant capital on acquisitions is there anything you can share with us about what type of payout ratio might be a reasonable request in light of your strong capital position? I think last year when we made our request we wanted to remain [ph] flexibility so that if we were to do acquisitions that we had built that into the submission that we had made and also have the ability to distribute a significant portion of earnings if we didn't do acquisitions.
And I would think we would structure our submission in a similar manner this year to give us flexibility in terms of what we do into 2013.
And I think the fact that we have a strong capital base and the fact that we fared very well in the severe scenario that the Fed selected and had our capital drop to a much lower degree than most others I think are all contributing factors that put us in a position to actually make that type of submission.
Research Division</strong> Okay got it.
And another question.
Your loan growth has really been consistently better than the rest of the industry over last year.
To what do you kind of attribute that outsized growth relative to peers? And also kind of what do you think the implications are for credit going forward? I think we saw in -- throughout 2009 -- the flutter [ph] of 2009 '10 and '11 that we improved sooner on the credit side than most of the industry.
And I think loan growth as we were in 2011 was probably being impacted by the fact that people were deleveraging and we were seeing paydown rates increase over that period.
But over the last 4 quarters or so we've seen our paydown rates stabilize more.
And as you know our paydown rates are significantly higher than the competition.
But the fact that those paydown rates are not going up I think is a contributing factor to the growth rate in loans gradually increasing over time.
And as you know we are very focused on Charge Card but also premium lending and so I think all of those things are contributing factors to the growth we see in loans.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And any implications in there? In credit? As you know our credit metrics are at historical lows.
As we think about where we go from here we want to be thoughtful in terms of growing the business -- growing the premium business.
Obviously as you bring on new accounts they have a somewhat higher risk profile just because they're at an earlier tenure in their life.
And quite frankly I've said this before if you were to give me a choice of bringing in a group of customers that were going to have a 3% write-off rate but had better economics compared to a group of customers that had a 2% write-off rate and lower economics I would pick the group with the 3% write-off rate.
Because again we're not endeavoring just to have a low write-off rate but good economic decisions when we do our investments.
Your next question is from Craig Maurer with CLSA.
Research Division</strong> I had a couple of questions.
So first back to the URR and just trying to continue to understand the trajectory here versus -- what are you finding when you look at -- you said you started looking at people that are staying in the program versus people that are leaving.
How much higher is the redemption rate of those staying in the program versus those you found who have left? And secondly if I could follow up on Loyalty Partner we spent a lot of time discussing that when I visited you guys recently and I know the growth in Germany and India is outstanding and you're coming to Mexico.
But when you put that in a broader context of the additional $3 billion in fee income over 5 years that you had suggested I think it was 3 Financial Community Meetings ago where are we in that progress? Okay.
So in talking about the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2011 we moved from using strictly data from people who had attrited to estimate the ultimate redemption rate to using that data plus information related to current participants and we thought that would give us a better estimate.
So that was kind of the change that we made at that juncture.
The work we're doing now in terms of reviewing the estimation process is we're looking at whether we can enhance the segmentation of the information so that we can have a refined estimate that's enhanced.
So that's the reason that we are looking at that.
I fully recognize that saying that we're going to have a charge isn't particularly helpful to you in terms of understanding the amount.
But at this juncture we haven't evolved the models to a sufficient degree to have a reliable estimate.
But I guess in terms of trying to frame it for yourself 2 things that you may think about is first as we disclosed in the annual report if there was a 100-basis-point increase in the URR -- this is not a forecast.
I'm simply quoting from the annual report.
If there was a 100-basis-point increase then too we would have a $330-million increase in the liability and there would be a charge to P&amp;L in that period.
I guess the other data point that I would give you that we haven't disclosed before is that if we had a 100-basis-point increase in the URR that would have an impact of increasing annual expense by approximately $40 million.
So that's in terms of just dimensionalizing it.
Hopefully it's helpful.
Now in terms of your second question related to fee-based revenue progress so we continue to expand the services we offer to cardmembers merchants and other customers.
There has been no change to the target that we put out there.
We're about halfway through our time frame and still think our target is appropriate although $3 billion is an ambitious target in an economy that remains so uneven.
There's still a great deal of work to do but we are moving forward on a number of fronts.
Our emphasis will be on organic growth but targeted acquisitions such as Loyalty Partner and Accertify may also play a role if we see the right opportunities.
So hopefully that answers your question.
Then we'll go next to James Freeman (sic) [James Friedman] with Susquehanna.
LLLP Research Division</strong> Could you share some observations or comments with regard to the fee-based revenue if you might have an update in that regard? So fee-based revenues is -- basically the update is what I just said a moment ago.
We continue to expand our services.
We're about halfway through the time frame that we laid out to hit the $3-billion target.
We recognize that it's a very ambitious target given the economy.
And we have great deal of work to do but we're moving forward.
I think we'll primarily get it through organic initiatives but we may do targeted acquisitions as well.
LLLP Research Division</strong> So in that regard Dan are you still comfortable with the targets that Ken had set forward a year or so ago? We think that target which is to be at a $3-billion run rate as we exit 2014 continues to be an appropriate target.
LLLP Research Division</strong> Okay one last one if I could sneak it in.
So could you share some observations about APAC? I know it's not huge but it was a little clunky.
Were there any specific observations in markets like Australia? Okay.
So Asia Pacific yes so I think we -- so Australia is a big market for us within the Asian market and we have seen a decline in business there particularly in the T&amp;E segment.
And we think that's probably a reflection of the fact that China is slowing down and Australia's economy has some pretty close linkages to China.
So that's the biggest impact that we're seeing that is influencing the slowdown in the growth rate in billings in that region.
Our next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.
Research Division</strong> Dan given the trajectory of loan growth and spending growth that you're seeing can you just give some commentary around whether you expect spending growth and loan growth to cross as you look ahead such that basically loan growth overtakes spending growth? And then secondly when does the loan growth that you're seeing lead to reserve building? So I would not -- I don't want to forecast here but I think loan growth is driven by 2 things: one it's the growth rate in spending on lending products; and then the second aspect is customer behavior and whether they are still in a mode that they want to kind of de-lever in which case we're going to see higher paydown rates.
Or at some juncture should they move to a space where they're more comfortable and aren't focused on that in which case we could move to a spot where the growth in loans is very similar to the growth in spending on lending products.
But there's lots of factors that play into that.
Certainly we have never ever had a target for loan growth.
So loan growth is simply an outcome of the products we put out there that allow customers to revolve if they choose to and then how that customer utilizes the balance.
But it emphasized that we are very focused on premium lending.
We are not engaging in balance transfer and we are looking to acquire customers that are higher spenders.
We also have a focus on the fact that there are customers out there who are very good customers for us are high spenders and carry balances at other institutions.
And I think we'd be very interested in acquiring those balances.
So certainly just like Charge Card premium lending has very good economics and it will continue to be one of our focuses going forward.
Research Division</strong> And when does the loan growth that you're seeing lead to some reserve building that -- we've been seeing kind of releases overwhelm everything else but is that something -- can you give us some color on when you expect that to change? Yes.
So I think as we grow the business we have always maintained the same types of credit requirements.
Although certainly as we look to get deeper penetration into premium lending you bring on new customers.
And any time you bring in a cohort of new customers at least in the first 2 years of their life they tend to have higher credit losses.
So that could be one element of it.
And again we -- as I said before we don't target loan write-off rates.
We target good economics.
Obviously the percentage of people who are in that lower-tenured group could be a factor then obviously the economy.
If the economy continues to be strong as we grow our business you'll probably see less of a movement.
If we see some deterioration in the economy that'll obviously influence it as we go forward.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And finally if I can just do one last one and going back to the fee-based questions can you just clarify for us whether you consider bluebird Serve and just prepaid in general to be part of your fee-based initiatives? And are revenues from prepaid I guess included in that fee-based revenue target that you put out there? I think certain elements would be.
So to the extent we get discount revenue on bluebird you could look at that as it's a fee because it is a fee.
And certainly other fee elements related to Serve would fit there.
To the extent we have interest income on float I wouldn't consider that to be a fee.
So it may -- certain elements in the product will be fees and others will not.
But certainly they would be part of what we're looking to in terms of achieving our target over time.
Research Division</strong> Okay and I'm sorry but just to be clear on that so the volume that you're going to get on Serve and bluebird that's going to get thrown into discount revenues and that will drive fees but the fees on that will count as part of the $3-billion fee-based revenue target.
Yes it is.
And I think it's logical because there's really no credit risk associated with those fees.
So I kind of view it a little different than we might discount revenue related to either charge or lending products.
And we now have a question from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.
Could you just provide a little more color on what you're seeing in the decline in T&amp;E spending? Is it fewer transactions? Is it lower prices on hotels or airline tickets? I noticed there was an increase in airline spending about 2% I think FX adjusted.
But I'm wondering if there's economic slowdown occurring in more than just Australia.
Yes.
So I would say that we are seeing lower T&amp;E spending compared to other categories pretty broadly.
It was a contributor to Australia.
It also was a contributing factor to the slowdown in growth rate for Global Corporate Services.
And I think we see large corporations in particular being a little bit conservative here and seeing a drop in spending among some of our larger corporate clients.
So it's pretty -- I think it's pretty broad-based.
And spread geographically as well.
Spread geographically as well yes and in some lower levels of transactions.
But notwithstanding that when you consider all those negatives I just said in that sentence we still are managing to have good business growth on an FX-adjusted basis of 8%.
Right okay.
And then I think you referenced higher cash rebates.
Can you just give us an idea of how much those are as an offset to discount revenue line? Well it's not an item that we separately disclose.
It is one of the items that represents the difference between the growth in billed business and the growth in discount revenues.
And I guess it's a reflection of the fact that our cash-back products are being successful in the marketplace so that pleases us in terms of that product category.
And then finally could you just clarify what you were saying about the regulatory and litigation reserves? It sounds like you didn't take anything additional in third quarter.
Is that to say that you don't -- and I guess you don't anticipate or it's not a problem not estimable [ph] what's related to the protection...
So the majority of the payout we had under the regulatory order had been previously accrued.
However in this quarter as we continued to do our own ongoing reviews we did accrue amounts related to those reviews.
So they were variable enough to mention but not so large that we would provide the dollar amount.
And I guess could you give us a sense if they were more or less than a year ago in the third quarter? So was that...
So in the third quarter of last year -- I think in each of the quarters that we've had I think they've been manageable numbers.
You have a big P&amp;L but just for the sake of...
That's a good thing.
Yes.
But for the sake of kind of making sense of this quarter's expenses versus last quarter can you just since you don't want to tell us the amount give us a sense of the size? As I said I think if you went back to the fourth quarter through now there has been some amount in each quarter but none in any quarter that kind of crosses our threshold for disclosing the amount.
Your next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.
Research Division</strong> It's been pretty quiet on the DOJ case in 2012.
I was just curious as you look out to '13 do you expect to see any procedural-type moves? Or would you expect it to be quiet again in '13? I think what we're expecting is for discovery to be completed sometime early in 2013.
And then after that there'll be some time that elapses before we actually get to the next stage in the process.
Then we'll go next to Chris Brendler with Stifel.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Could you just give us -- sort of turning back to one of the earlier questions on the $3-billion target for fee-based revenues I guess I'm not sure.
At this point it's been at least 1 year almost 2 since you laid out those goals.
I'm just wondering what's going well? What's not? It seems like -- I would have thought we'd get a little more detail on Serve and how that's progressing.
The bluebird product seems like a very compelling offer.
It could be a big part of that pie should -- as you seek to achieve that $3-billion goal.
Can you give us any detail on what the major components of that revenue target were and where you stand today in any way shape or form? So I -- there's certainly a broad set of initiatives.
Certainly Serve and prepaid reloadables would be elements where we would expect to contribute to our target.
Loyalty Partner is an acquisition that we've discussed with you.
We would think that's another notable piece of the pie.
I would say though that if we were to sit here 3 years ago and think about the progress that would've been made in alternative payments and wallets and the like you probably would've thought we were further along than we are today.
So that's not a comment about American Express specifically but really about the industry.
We continue to see a fair amount of press releases but not necessarily a fair amount of product that's in the marketplace.
And the other thing as I mentioned is this is a pretty uneven economy.
So it makes the achieving that target all the more challenging but we do have a number of projects that are under way.
And we continue to look at other initiatives as we go forward over the next 2 years as we head towards the latter part of 2014.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay a follow-up question on the credit card business.
The lending margin was up this quarter.
I didn't exactly -- understand exactly what was driving that.
It wasn't like a huge increase but it looked by my calculations to be mostly on the top line yields a nice little bump in the interest charges you're getting on your lending accounts.
Anything driving that? I mean your lending growth has been relatively impressive.
I know it's a byproduct of your spending strategy.
Just trying to think about what's causing the yield to go up at the same time the loan growth is picking up.
Yes it's -- so as you say it's only up slightly.
It could be a little bit related to revolve rates but not a huge move in revolve rates.
So we continue to watch it and make sure that the mix we have is right.
Certainly just a change in mix among products can also have a slight increase in terms of -- increase or decrease depending on which way it moves.
So we watch it closely.
We've said that we want that number to be around 9% and that's what it's been largely over the last several quarters slightly higher this quarter but not by a huge amount.
Then we'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> Most of my questions have been answered but maybe we could get you to dimensionalize some of the asset growth the lending products growth.
You kind of pointed out that spending growth is better than the lending growth and that there's a number of factors that are driving that.
But could you in any way provide us with some sense as to whether this is an increase in traction for the premium lending strategy or if this is just the willingness of existing card members to increase their borrowing? So it's hard to tease that out to be quite frank.
We are focused on premium lending.
We have developed products to drive in that direction.
As I said before we recognize that there are some of our cardmembers who we know very well and we think have good credit who have balances elsewhere.
That's certainly one of the things that we are thinking about.
We're staying away from balance transfers and those kinds of initiatives so we're not going there.
And as I said before we have never had a target for loan growth.
It's an outcome of putting products in the marketplace as a design to drive spend and then the consumer deciding to utilize that.
And how much they want to utilize that in part will be impacted by lots of things including how they feel in terms of their confidence and where the economy is going.
So there's lots of small moving parts within there.
But there's not one overarching driving force that is impacting loan growth.
And you could see that it's been a very gradual increase over time.
And the fact that is the biggest is that 1 year ago or more we were really seeing an increase in the paydown rate.
And that was holding down loan growth effectively and that has really -- it's increasing a little bit but it's really stabilized over the last several quarters.
So in terms of a change I would say that's probably the largest contributing factor.
Research Division</strong> Okay that's helpful.
And then maybe if you could discuss in any way the decision to essentially rebrand Serve with a much bigger American Express prominence.
I've found that to be quite interesting.
I don't know if there's a thought that it just wasn't getting enough traction as an independent brand and it just needs to effectively ride on the coattails of American Express.
But if you could provide some sense as to what drove that decision.
So I think all new products evolve over time.
And I think as a company we came to the realization that our brand has a lot of attributes which are important to people who would use the Serve product or a reloadable prepaid.
We do stand for trust security and servicing.
All those things are important when you think about a product like those.
And so the decision was made to make it more prominent so people who are purchasing those products recognize the linkage of Serve to the American Express family.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And is there any -- I mean is it essentially targeting from an aspirational brand perspective a different demographic now? Or is it still the same and it's just a function of gaining more traction? So I think -- obviously people who are utilizing the reloadable prepaid in particular are a different group of customers than some of our premium products.
But I think many of the attributes of our company and our brand are important to that customer group as well.
And we think we have a platform in Serve which is what reloadable prepaid is running on and so we want to leverage that.
And we think we can put products out there that can be very competitive in the marketplace.
That will come from Mike Taiano with Telsey Advisory Group.
So just wanted to follow up on the bluebird question.
So it seems like the obvious rationale here is to push more volume onto Amex's network.
But I guess are there some secondary benefits as well? So in other words from a data standpoint do you benefit from getting access to a different demographic? And does that help you with some of your other businesses? And would it also potentially help you on the acceptance front as well? So I'd say yes to all of those things right? So I think it does push more volume onto our network.
We think that is a very good thing.
We think we can achieve good economics.
We also see it as a large market today I think over $300 billion.
And it's forecasted to grow at I think 12% to 13% going forward.
So it's a growing market.
We have the capabilities and skills to be successful here.
And so we viewed it as a good opportunity and also helping to grow to -- contribute to our growth in fee businesses.
Okay great.
And then just one quick follow-up on -- a lot of talk about the fiscal cliff here coming up and just wondering does that affect your guys -- your planning at American Express in terms of the timing of marketing and your ability to maybe -- if there is a larger impact than expected to ratchet back on maybe some of your marketing spend early next year? So in our planning we always have a base-case plan and we have been scenarios.
If things were to be better we know exactly what we'd do.
And if things were to be worse we know exactly what we're going to do.
So we will monitor this closely.
But at the moment we're focused on our base plan but do have these other scenarios in case we need to react quickly.
Okay.
So thanks everybody for joining the call and have a good evening.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by.
Welcome to the American Express Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead.
Thank you and thanks to everyone for joining us for our Q4 discussion again.
The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2011 10-K and Q1 2 and 3 2012 Form 10-Q reports already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for the prior period that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dan completes his remarks we will move to Q&amp;A.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay.
Thanks Rick and I'll start on Slide 2.
So this is the fourth quarter summary of financial performance.
So revenues came in at $8.1 billion up 5% both on a reported and FX basis.
If you exclude the $93 million of cardmember reimbursements that are contra-revenues revenues would have grown 6%.
Net income came in at $637 million.
That's $0.56 of EPS.
If you exclude the restructuring charge MR reserve and cardmember reimbursements that we discussed last week adjusted EPS would be $1.09.
ROE was 23%.
If you adjust it for the same 3 items I just mentioned it would have been 26% for the fourth quarter.
And you can see shares are declining reflecting our repurchases.
Moving to Slide 3.
So this is a reconciliation from net income of $637 million down to income of $1.2 billion which relates to the $1.09.
So the first item here is the restructuring charge and restructuring is part of staying ahead of the curve.
It is designed to contain operating expenses and free up resources for growth initiatives.
Our core business results continue to show the benefits of growth investments we've made over the last several years.
We have increased share in a very competitive U.S.
industry improved risk management capabilities and introduced innovative products.
We believe these fourth quarter actions will make our cost structure leaner and more efficient.
Our aim is to grow operating expense less than 3% in both 2013 and 2014 freeing up funds to reinvest back into the many growth opportunities we have across the business be it our core products prepaid or mobile.
Next is the Membership Rewards expense related to the refinement in the estimated ultimate redemption rate in the U.S.
And third is cardmember reimbursements for issues that go back several years.
The line items in the statement of income that these items are reflected on is clearly laid out on a chart in our 2012 fourth quarter earnings supplement.
Moving to Slide 4.
So this is the only slide we have on full year 2012.
You can see revenues came in at $31.5 billion up 5% or 6% on an FX-adjusted basis.
Net income was $4.4 billion.
That relates to EPS of $3.89.
If we were to adjust for the items that I discussed before adjusted EPS would be $4.40.
And you can see the lower shares reflect the repurchase of 69 million shares during the year and the issuance of 10 million shares under employee plans.
Moving to Slide 5.
So these are our fourth quarter metrics.
So billed business was $235 billion in the fourth quarter.
That's up 8% from last year or 7% on an FX-adjusted basis.
In the third quarter reported growth was 6% or 8% on an FX-adjusted basis.
So billed business growth very similar in the fourth quarter to what we saw in the third quarter.
And our billings growth continues to be toward the upper end of the range among our large issuing competitors.
Cards-in-force and average basic cardmember spending growth also are similar to the third quarter.
We grew proprietary cards 3% in this quarter.
Cardmember loans growth was down slightly from the 6% we had in the third quarter to 4% in the fourth quarter.
Moving to Slide 6.
So this is billed business growth by segment.
Total FX-adjusted growth moved from 8% in the third quarter to 7% in the fourth quarter.
GNS the yellow line has moved up slightly to 12% on higher growth in Latin America.
Global Corporate Services the green line moved down slightly to 6% growth as T&amp;E spending grew more slowly than total billings growth.
In the upper right hand you can see that full year we had billed business of $888 billion.
Moving to Slide 7.
So this is billed business growth by region.
The U.S.
growth slowed slightly from 8% to 7%.
The other regions are either stable or growth was up slightly.
JAPA the green line is up slightly.
Australia's growth rate stabilized in the fourth quarter and Hong Kong growth was stronger.
EMEA the blue line also is up slightly driven by higher growth in Germany and the U.K.
Moving to Slide 8.
So this is worldwide managed loans.
The bars reflect the dollar amount of loans in each quarter and the line is the growth rate.
We now have several quarters where we've had growth around 4% slightly down from 6% in the third quarter.
So we are seeing growth in loans driven by our billed business growth.
We are not using 0 balance transfers to grow loans.
If you look at our competitors November year-to-date 73% of consumer acquisition mail offers included a 0 balance transfer offer.
So in the fourth quarter growth on spending on lending products was 9% while loans grow 4% and we continue to see excellent credit quality.
Moving to Slide 9.
So this is revenue performance.
So total revenues grew at 5%.
You can see that in the bottom right 6% excluding the cardmember reimbursement some $93 million which were contra-revenues.
Starting at the top of the page discount revenue grew 6% reflecting 8% growth in billed business partially offset by a decline in discount rate the impact of cardmember reimbursements and higher contra-revenue items including cash rebate rewards.
Net card fees reflect an increase in proprietary cards and higher average fees per card related to our premium products in U.S.
Consumer and International Consumer businesses.
Travel commissions and fees decreased 2% due to lower transaction-related revenue.
Business travel sales declined 1% while U.S.
Consumer travel sales increased 9%.
Other commissions and fees are up 5% and that growth primarily reflects higher revenues at Loyalty Partner.
Other revenues grew 4%.
We had a larger gain on ICB shares in the fourth quarter this year compared to last year although the fourth quarter gain on the ICB shares was similar to what we had in the third quarter.
And we also had higher network partner fees in GNS.
Net interest income increased 7%.
Average cardmember loans are up 5%.
Worldwide net interest yield is at 9.1% up from 8.9% in 2011.
The impact of cardmember reimbursements in the fourth quarter this year is why it is lower than the third quarter rate of 9.3%.
Net interest yield also benefited from lower funding costs.
Next moving to Slide 10.
So this is provision for losses.
And here you can see that provision in the fourth quarter of this year is higher primarily because of a small build in reserves in 2012 compared to reserve releases in the fourth quarter of 2011 and you can see that on the bottom of this chart.
Charge card provision decreased 11% compared to last year.
We had a lower reserve build of about $19 million this year compared to a $50 million reserve build last year.
This is partially offset by higher receivable levels of 5%.
And the write-off in both periods are about the same.
So basically the lower charge card provision relates to a lower reserve build.
Cardmember loan provision increased $247 million.
This reflects a 4% increase in cardmember loans compared to last year a reserve build in the fourth quarter of 2012 of $12 million compared to a reserve release in the fourth quarter of last year of $265 million which was partially offset by lower write-offs this year.
Write-offs this year were $346 million and that compares to $386 million last year.
So again the change in the reserve is primarily driven by reserve releases last year or we had a slight build this year.
So provision is going up while credit metrics remain stable and you'll see that on the next several slides.
So Slide 11 is charge card credit performance.
And on the left chart you can see the U.S.
consumer write-off rate has ticked up and down slightly over the past several quarters.
But I would view this as basically stable over this period.
On the right side you see the International Consumer and Global Corporate Services net loss ratio and the same thing is this is stable.
So for charge card relatively stable metrics over this period.
And these are all historically -- at historically low levels.
Next going to Slide 12.
So this is the lending credit performance.
So these metrics also continued to be stable.
You can see on the left-hand side the write-off rate has ticked down slightly but it's basically stable over this period.
In December the U.S.
managed lending write-off rate was 2.1%.
The 30-day past due improved slightly in the quarter but again is basically stable over this period.
These metrics are also at historic lows and represent the best credit metrics in the industry.
As I say each quarter our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rates but to achieve the best economic gain when we invest.
Slide 13.
So these are our lending reserve coverage metrics.
So you can look at reserves as a percentage of loans reserves as a percentage of past due and principal months coverage in both the U.S.
and at the bottom worldwide.
These metrics are all very similar to what we saw in the third quarter and we think they're appropriate given the risks in the portfolio.
So next is Slide 14.
So this is looking at expenses now.
So total expenses increased 18%.
You can see that on the bottom right.
However if you exclude the 3 items mentioned on Slide 3 the restructuring the MR reserve and the cardmember reimbursements adjusted growth in operating expense would be 3% and for total expense would be 2%.
Marketing and promotion is 2% lower than the fourth quarter of 2011 but remain at very healthy levels as you'll see on the next slide.
Cardmember rewards increased 27% primarily driven by the $342 million expense related to the refinement in the ultimate redemption rate estimate in the U.S.
and I'll discuss that in 2 slides.
Excluding this item adjusted expense grew 2% a slower growth rate than spending on MR products partly due to a lower weighted average cost per point in the fourth quarter of this year compared to the third quarter of 2012.
Total operating expense increased 15%.
However when you adjust for the fourth quarter 2011 Visa proceeds and the fourth quarter of 2012 restructuring and cardmember reimbursement charges the growth rate is 3%.
Now in most quarters we have small reengineering charges that we don't separately highlight.
If you were to further adjust the fourth quarter of 2011 for its restructuring charge of $49 million the adjusted growth rate is 5%.
I will discuss the operating expense line in a few slides.
Moving to Slide 15.
So this is marketing expense.
So marketing expense was $722 million in the fourth quarter this year compared to $735 million in the fourth quarter of '11 down slightly but still healthy.
On the left side you can see marketing and promotion expense as a percentage of managed revenues on an annual basis.
Our objective is for marketing and promotion to be approximately 9% of revenues.
On the right side you can see the percentage by quarter.
In the fourth quarter the percentage was 8.9% of revenues and it varied over the quarters in 2012.
But as you can see for full year it was 9.2%.
This level we believe can drive our business momentum.
So next is Slide 16.
So this is a historical look at the ultimate redemption rate for current enrollees worldwide.
While we have refined our estimate prices -- process twice in the past 4 years the primary driver for the higher ultimate redemption rate is higher cardmember redemptions as we have enhanced the program.
A data point that supports this is that at the beginning of 2009 45% of U.S.
current enrollees had made at least one redemption.
That percentage so the number of current U.S.
enrollees that have made at least 1 redemption has increased to approximately 60% at the end of 2012 a clear reflection of the increased redemption behavior by current enrollees.
Next is Slide 17.
So this is operating expense and you can see in the bottom right that it increased 19%.
Excluding the restructuring reserve the impact of cardmember reimbursements in operating expense for the fourth quarter of '12 and the Visa litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of 2011 adjusted operating expense was 3%.
Now if we look at salaries and benefits it increased 24%.
But excluding the $369 million of restructuring reserves that resulted in expense on this line adjusted expense was flat with the fourth quarter of 2011.
Professional services occupancy and equipment and communications all grew modestly.
Adjusted other net increased 38%.
If you exclude the restructuring charge in cardmember reimbursements from this line adjusted expense increased 21%.
This increase reflects a litigation-related reserve release or basically a credit in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as an impairment of a cost method investment in the current quarter.
Overall operating expense adjusted growth was 3%.
Moving to Slide 18.
So this is operating expense growth over the past 9 quarters.
The green line is the growth in operating expense.
The blue line is growth in revenues.
And the dotted green line is operating expense excluding litigation settlement proceeds and in the fourth quarter of 2011 the restructuring reserve and cardmember reimbursements on the line.
So I'll make several points.
The growth rate in 2010 and early 2011 was a result of our strategy to invest in the business utilizing credit releases and the settlement proceeds.
In 2012 we stated our objective was to grow operating expense at a pace slower than revenue growth.
Adjusting for the items I just referred to we were successful at this in 2012.
This demonstrates our ability to effectively control operating expense.
Our aim now is to grow operating expense at an annual rate of less than 3% in both 2013 and 2014.
The 2012 operating expense excluding the restructuring charge will be our base.
Looking at Slide 19.
So these are expenses as a percentage of revenues.
So this is adjusted expenses.
And in this case by adjusted we mean to exclude credit provision.
So on the left side you can see 5 years of history.
On the right side you can see the past 5 quarters.
In 2012 and in the fourth quarter of 2012 the dotted line in the bar excludes the restructuring charge and cardmember reimbursements that are in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The adjusted percentage in the fourth quarter is 70% and 71% for the full year of 2012.
As you can see in 2012 we made substantial progress reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenues.
Over time we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first through revenue growth; and second our plans to contain operating expense growth.
Next is Slide 20 capital ratios.
You can see that the tier 1 common ratio is 11.9% at the end of the fourth quarter down from 12.7% in the third quarter of 2012.
We generated $700 million in capital in the quarter $600 million from net income plus $100 million from employee plans.
We distributed $1.2 billion in capital $1 billion in share repurchases and this is in line with our capital plan and our 2012 CCAR submission and $200 million of dividends.
In addition risk-weighted assets increased seasonally as accounts receivable and loans increased in the quarter.
Tier 1 common ratio of 11.9% keeps us at -- with very strong capital ratios and well-above required benchmarks.
Next is Slide 21 which is our total payout ratio.
So this is the percentage of capital generated returned to shareholders.
On the left-hand side is the past 5 years.
On the right side the 4 quarters in 2012.
Our share buybacks and dividends were in line with our capital plan and 2012 CCAR submission.
We continue to make [ph] strong capital ratios while buying back 4 billion of shares in 2012 and currently paying a $0.20 dividend per share per quarter and dividends in 2012 totaled $900 million.
Moving to Slide 22.
So this is a liquidity snapshot.
Our objective is to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities.
You can see that the funding maturities are $6.6 billion (sic) [$16.6 billion] and excess cash and securities were $6.1 billion (sic) [$16.1 billion] at 12/31/2012.
So we were $500 million shy of our objective and this is a result of accounts payable decreasing faster than we had forecasted therefore consuming cash.
By the first week in January excess cash and securities exceeded the funding maturities over the next 12 months.
We continue to have a strong liquidity position.
Slide 23.
So this is our retail deposits by type.
And you can see that we increased direct deposits by $1.7 billion in the quarter to $19.4 billion and total deposits increased $2.7 billion in the quarter to $39.7 billion.
The increased deposits funded in part the seasonal increase in higher accounts receivable and loans on our balance sheet.
We continue to be committed to increase direct deposits over time.
Next is Slide 24.
So this is a chart that shows ABS and unsecured debt issuances over the past 3 years and an estimated range of potential issuances in 2013.
This is in line with our funding strategy to maintain a diversified funding profile.
So we will continue to use both ABS and unsecured funding channels in addition to retail deposit program to meet our refinance and business growth needs in 2013.
So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.
While our fourth quarter results were impacted by 3 items we feel that the trends in our business metrics are indicative of the underlying strength of our business.
We continue to feel positive about our performance especially given the uncertain economic environment.
In the quarter spend growth continued to be healthy in a very uneven economy.
Fourth quarter billings growth rates were relatively consistent with the prior quarter despite the negative impact of Hurricane Sandy.
Our billings growth continues to be towards the upper end of the range among our large issuing competitors.
We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpaced the industry leading to 7% growth in net interest income.
At the same time lending loss rates remain near all-time lows.
Revenue growth was 5% up slightly on a reported basis from last quarter and consistent on an FX-adjusted basis.
The growth reflects the impact of a weak economic environment but is still significantly better than many other issuers.
Excluding the items disclosed last week and last year's Visa settlement payment adjusted operating expense increased by 3% in the quarter versus the prior year.
We continue to focus on controlling operating expenses as evidenced by the restructuring program announced last week.
We are now aiming to have operating expense grow at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next 2 years and we will seek to use a portion of the savings to reinvest in the business.
We will measure this off of the 2012 base that excludes the restructuring charge.
We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks in line with the authorizations under the 2012 CCAR submission.
Our capital ratios remain strong and despite the impact of the 3 items in the quarter are generally higher than forecasted in our 2012 capital plan.
Looking ahead we recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead.
So thanks for listening and we are ready to take questions.
[Operator Instructions] And we'll open the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.
Research Division</strong> Dan can you talk about whether you're seeing any evidence of competitors pulling back on their investment spending particularly with the benefits from reserve releases having largely abated and the large bank issuers still not really seeing any balance growth? So I think Bill if you look at card mailings really in this quarter and last quarter they're down from where they were earlier in the year.
What other investment actions they're taking we don't have great visibility into.
I would comment on that we continue to be very focused on operating expense so that we can have additional resources to invest in the many opportunities we have both in our core business and mobile and across all of our businesses.
So we can -- remain very focused.
And actually quite frankly part of the reason for our restructuring charge was to stay ahead of the curve and to ensure that we had the resources we need to invest in the business even though it's a relatively uneven economy.
Research Division</strong> So just to make sure that I'm interpreting that correctly.
So is the way that you're thinking about the travel services restructuring is that kind of a source of funds that's going to allow you to continue to invest in better growth opportunities in other areas? And then maybe along that -- along with that if you could also talk about your pecking order of investment opportunities and how attractive you see them today versus say over the course of the last couple of years how they've changed? Yes.
So this was not solely a business travel restructuring right? I think business travel is a large piece of the restructuring but the restructurings are also taking place in our servicing operations.
And we are having other reductions in staff groups basically areas that are not generating revenues.
Business travel is an area where we are restructuring.
It's an important business to us.
It's an important adjacency to our Corporate Card business.
It allows us to deepen our relationships with Corporate Card clients.
And so while business travel hasn't been a significant generator of revenues for us we do continue to look at ways continually to reengineer the business.
The reason that we've taken a bigger step in business travel as far as restructuring is that we now have a new leadership team in place who proposed turning up the dial on our reengineering efforts in response to the changes that we're seeing in the business landscape.
And we decided to implement their proposal.
But that's not the only place that we're reengineering.
We do it on a regular basis.
And we have done really a terrific job in our servicing areas to improve quality as you've seen where we continue to win the J.D.
Power award and at the same time adopt to changing in the marketplace.
So we've invested say in the ability to take remittances electronically.
Over 80% of our remittances are received electronically in 2012.
Many people are changing the way they want to interface with us.
So for instance we've invested in apps to allow people to communicate with us either through smartphones or tablet servicing applications.
In fact we had contacts through those 2 means increase to 5 million apps downloaded  5 million times compared to 2.6 million times in 2011.
So we're constantly reengineering both in business travel in the servicing and in other parts of our business.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
If I may ask one last question here can you give a sense of what percentage of your volumes comes from customers who would be directly impacted by the threshold -- the new threshold limits after the tax law changes? So it's hard to say.
The last time we saw a large tax increase was back in '93.
At that time there were a lot of other things going on but we didn't see an impact on volumes in that period.
Back in '93 billed business grew at 10% and in '94 13%.
Now it was truly a different economic environment and GDP was more in the 3% to 4% range but we didn't see it have an impact then.
The other thing that I'd point out is U.S.
consumer is an important part of our business but our business is very diversified.
We have large Corporate Card business large international business.
We have GNS partners around the world.
So it's hard to predict what if any impact we're going to have from the tax law change.
We will open the lines of Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Research Division</strong> Just wanted to clarify if I could.
The expense base if you took the $23.141 billion of total expenses backed out the $802 million charges in the fourth quarter that's your base you'll grow by less than 3%? So I have to look at the numbers...
Research Division</strong> Just looking at Page 6 of your...
The only thing that we're going to back out we're going to take operating expense as we define it on our slide for the year.
And we're going to back out the $400 million restructuring charge.
That's the only adjustment we're going to make.
And then going forward we will compare to that number.
Research Division</strong> And also the rewards charge the cardmember rewards charge too yes? Yes.
So this is not -- so when you look at this it's not marketing it's not rewards.
It's just the -- if you were to look at Slide 17 the -- this is what we're defining as operating expense.
So in this quarter it's $3.7 billion.
I don't know what the annual number is.
But I think the annual number as defined here and subtract the $400 million restructuring charge that will be our base.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then I mean you returned over 100% of capital generated this year and your tier 1 common of 11.9%.
Would you anticipate being having the flexibility as excluding -- assuming you don't make acquisitions to do something similar? And what is your target tier 1 common? So we have said our target is 10%.
We have been above that level for the past couple of years.
So at the moment we're staying [ph] in the range that we are today.
We have not completed our Basel II work that will not be done for some time now.
And we want to see whether there's any impacts that come out of that.
We need to complete that work.
And at that juncture if there were no impacts we would probably tend to take it down from where it is today.
So from a target perspective that's how we think about it.
This year we returned 98% of capital to shareholders.
I think in our CCAR submission we will have a similar philosophy that we had this year that if we're not utilizing the capital to support growth in the balance sheet for acquisitions that we will be inclined to return it to shareholders.
And the fact that we have a very strong capital position is helpful on that.
I think it's also helpful that last year when the Fed did their stress analysis we didn't see our capital ratios drop anywhere near what the other -- many of the other banks did in that review.
So I think all those things contribute to having the type of flexibility that we want from a capital perspective.
We will open the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> I just had a big-picture question.
I was wondering if in this type of macro environment you guys think you could hit your on average and over-time targets because it seems like we might be in this environment for a little bit.
Yes.
I think that when we set our target of 8% revenue growth we assumed it was a normal economy with GDP at the 10-year average which is 2.7% or so.
At -- GDP at 2% it becomes difficult to hit the 8%.
Discount revenue is 50% of revenues.
And while our billed business has held up performed well in this environment compared to competitors this is a pretty good linkage between GDP and what our growth rates have been.
Over time if you look at real GDP our growth rates have been between 3x and 4x that number.
So if we have billed business growth in the high-single digits then hitting 8% overall growth becomes a challenge.
So in this quarter we did have good growth in card fees.
It was up 6%.
We did have good growth in net interest income up 7%.
And some of our other fee business lines had mid-single-digit growth rates.
So we'll strive to be a growth company in a slow-growth environment.
But achieving 8% is challenging with GDP in the U.S.
where it is.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
Research Division</strong> I guess just one follow-up.
I mean you guys are kind of returning a little bit more capital than your target suggests as well and you do have some operating leverage kind of levers.
Could you just speak to that as it ties into that discussion? Well we always are open to acquisitions.
Although as you know we've achieved our growth and the share gains that we've experienced over the last several years through organic investments and likely that'll be the major driver.
We remain open to acquisitions if the right one comes along with the right returns.
Certainly the extent that we're able to increase our operating leverage and control operating expense then that frees up more investment dollars to put into the many opportunities that we have across our business and that could help to generate additional revenues as well.
This quarter we actually saw Loyalty Partner which was an acquisition start to contribute to revenue growth.
The other thing is that the share buybacks that we're doing are giving us good improvement in terms of reducing the shares outstanding and that gives us a lift in our EPS calculation.
So we balance all those things against each other as we go forward.
And our next question is from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.
L.P.
Research Division</strong> One question on the previously stated goal of getting to $3 billion in fee revenue by the end of 2014.
Does anything change with last week's announcement related to some of the cardmember issues there or also just as you commented previously a moment ago about the economic environment makes some things more challenging? So I don't think any of the items that we identified last week will affect our ability to do fee revenues.
Certainly regulators across the industry are looking closely at all products that are offered to cardmembers.
I think we're going to continue to look at opportunities to expand services that we offer to cardmembers and merchants.
At this juncture we don't have a plan to change our $3 billion target.
We are about halfway through the time frame and still think it's appropriate although I would say that $3 billion is an ambitious target given the uneven economy.
And there's a lot of work to do but we're moving forward on a number of fronts.
I think Loyalty department is a good example of building fee services.
I think the early returns that we're seeing on Bluebird in the reloadable prepaid space is another example where we think we can be successful.
So certainly the economy does have an impact but we're going to continue to see if we can grow fee services as we go forward.
L.P.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just one question about your comments about the tapping into rewards by cardmembers that back in 2009 only 49% had regained rewards.
If I take a glass half full perspective that seems to me to suggest that you might have had a newer cohort of cardmembers back in 2009 who hadn't just gotten to the point where they did redeem rewards.
Is that the wrong way to think about it or...
So I think -- so it was 45%.
L.P.
Research Division</strong> 45% sorry.
I wasn't clear.
That's okay.
I don't think that our cardmember base has changed radically.
Obviously we've added a fair number of cardmembers since 2009.
I look at that increase as an increase of engagement of the people who are in the program.
And I think that increase in engagement is heavily influenced by the enhancements that we've made to the program expanding the options people have giving people the opportunity to redeem with fewer points or using Pay with Points.
So I think those are all things that have contributed to the increased engagement of the number of people who have redeemed.
And I thought it was useful just in terms of thinking about another data point that demonstrates that it is the higher level of engagement that's driving the URR.
And our next question is from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> I think as you've indicated obviously the restructuring is going to help you at least slow some of the growth of OpEx.
But you'll look to take at least some of those benefits and reinvest it I guess presumably in marketing and promotion.
Can you talk about how those potentially offsetting factors might impact the pace at which you revert to that longer-term ratio of expenses to manage revenues of 68% 69%? Yes.
So I think -- so that percentage includes both marketing rewards and operating expense.
And I think we want to be focused on operating expense growth levels and achieve our target of less than 3% growth over the next 2 years.
We're going to take a piece of that and reinvest it back in the business.
So that could be marketing and promotion or it could be on the operating expense line as well depending what we think is going to give us the best return.
But it will be a piece of what we save what we reinvest.
And therefore I think it'll actually continue to increase the leverage in this calculation and enable us to continue to head back to where we were.
So part of it is to help with leverage and part is to enable higher levels of investment.
Research Division</strong> Is that 69% level realistic for 2013? 60...
Research Division</strong> 69%? I'm not sure what the 69% is.
Research Division</strong> Of the -- your expenses to manage revenues? Yes.
So I don't think we've set a target for next year.
We were at 71% for the full year of 2012 and at 70% in the fourth quarter.
So if we're successful on operating expense you might expect that to decrease.
I don't think we disclosed an exact amount.
Certainly it wouldn't take us all the way back to 67% but I think we can continue to make progress towards that goal.
And at this time there are no other questions in queue.
Okay.

Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon.
Thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time all lines are in listen-only mode.
Later there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time.
(Operator Instructions) As a reminder today’s conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead.
Thank you Tom.
Welcome and we appreciate everyone joining for today’s discussion.
The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the Company’s financial and other goals are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company’s 2011 10-K already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2013 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior period that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter’s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Dan completes his remarks we will move to Q&amp;A.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay.
Thanks Rick.
So I will start on Slide 2.
So the first quarter of 2013 summary of financial performance so total revenues came in at $7.9 billion for the first quarter of 2013.
That’s 4% higher on a reported basis and 5% growth year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis.
That’s the same FX adjusted revenue growth that we’ve had for the past two quarters.
Pre-tax income came in at $1.9 billion up 8%.
Net income came in at $1.3 billion up 2%.
So net income grew at a slower rate than pre-tax income in the first quarter because in the first quarter of 2012 it included a tax benefit realized on certain foreign tax credits and we had no such item in the first quarter of 2013.
Diluted EPS was $1.15 up 7%.
EPS grew at a faster pace than net income due to share buybacks.
As you can see shares outstanding on the bottom of this chart are 5% lower year-over-year.
ROE is 23% for the quarter compared to 27% in the first quarter 2012 and this is due to the three charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2012 which was about $600 million.
So the ROE is calculated using net income for the 12 months ended March 31 2013.
Therefore it includes the fourth quarter of 2012 and that’s divided by average shareholder equity.
Excluding those three charges in the fourth quarter adjusted ROE would have been 26% and you can actually see that calculation in Annex 6 through the slides.
Moving to Slide 3 which is a metric performance.
You can see that billed business came in at $224 billion.
It grew at 6% on a reported basis 7% on an FX adjusted basis.
So the same FX adjusted growth rate that we had in the fourth quarter of 2012 despite the negative impact of having an extra billing day in the first quarter of 2012 because it was a Leap Year.
Cards in force grew at 5% the same as the fourth quarter.
Proprietary cards grew at 2% which is comparable to the growth rate we’ve seen over the last several quarters.
Growth in average basic cardmember spending reflects continued strong cardmember engagement and cardmember loans continued modest growth growing at 4%.
Moving to Slide 4 so this is billed business growth by segment and as you can see on the chart total FX adjusted growth the redline in the first quarter of 2013 was 7% consistent with the fourth quarter of last year.
Each of the business segments is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012 except for GCS which is Global Corporate Services that’s the green line and you can see here that the growth rate for that segment has moved down slightly as T&amp;E spending grew at a slower rate than total billings growth rate in the quarter.
Now 2012 was a Leap Year so we lost one day of billing year-over-year which negatively impacts billed business growth rate in the first quarter of this year by about 100 basis points.
Going to Slide 5 this is billed business growth by region.
So you can see that the U.S.
which is the dark blue line with the diamonds grew at 7% consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012.
And while each of the other regions had their growth rate slow a bit in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter in aggregate total FX adjusted growth rate of 7% is consistent with last quarter.
Then we have Slide 6 so this is the U.S.
consumer managed cardmember loans.
The bars are the dollar amount of loans the light blue line is the U.S.
consumer loan growth rate and the new line is the green line and that’s the U.S.
industry revolve growth in each of the quarters.
So the 4% growth in loans is driven by growth in billed business.
Loans are growing at about half the rate of the growth in billings or lending products.
Our loan growth continues to outpace the industry as you can see by looking at the green line.
So for example in the fourth quarter of this year we grew at 4% and the industry growth rate was 1%.
The last point they make is that while loans grew 4% year-over-year loans decreased sequentially on a seasonal basis from the fourth quarter.
As you’ll see in a minute credit performance continues to be excellent.
Slide 7 so this is our revenue performance.
Total revenues grew 4%.
That’s 5% on an FX adjusted basis.
Discount revenue came in at 4% and this reflects 6% growth in billed business partially offset by 1 basis point decline in the discount rate and higher cash back rewards.
Net card fees increased 7% and this is reflective of higher average fees per card primarily due to fee increases and a greater mix of premium products.
Travel commission and fees decreased 3% as worldwide sales decreased 3%.
Business travel declined 4% while consumer travel sales increased 2%.
Other commissions and fees decreased 2% and this is the impact of some modest cost of cardmember reimbursement partially offset by higher Loyalty Partner revenues.
Other revenues is lower by 3% and this is primarily due to a favorable revision of our liability for uncashed TCs in international markets in the first quarter of 2012 and is partially offset by higher gains on our sale of ICBC shares in the first quarter of 2013.
Net interest income increased 10% and this is a combination of 3% increase in average cardmember loans an increase in the worldwide net interest yield to 5.9% from 9.2% a year ago.
Now a portion of this increase is due to the reversal of reserve for cardmember reimbursements that we set up in prior periods and without it the increase would have been slightly lower.
It’s also influenced by a decline in funding cost for our charge card portfolio.
Moving to Slide 8 so this is provision for losses.
You can see the total provision for losses increased 21%.
Charge card provision increased 10% primarily driven by higher receivables which are 5% higher than a year ago.
Cardmember loan provision increased 30% or $63 million and this reflects a 4% increase in cardmember loans compared to last year.
Our reserve release of about $100 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a reserve release of $200 million in the first quarter of 2012 and this has the effect of increasing provision by $100 million partially offset by approximately $50 million less in write-offs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to improved credit performance.
This will net to a $63 million increase in the lending provision.
So provision is increasing while credit metrics are stable and you’ll see that over the next several slides.
So Slide 9 is charge card credit performance and if you look at the left charge this is the U.S.
charge write-off rate and this has ticked up and down slightly over the past few quarters but I view this as stable over the period.
On the right side you see the international consumer and Global Corporate Services net loss ratio and this also has remained stable.
Both of these metrics are at historically low levels.
Moving to Slide 10 so this is the lending credit performance.
The left side is the net write-off rate and this metric continues to be stable.
The right side is the 30 days past due and the same is true here.
This metric continues to be very stable.
So these metrics are at historically low levels and represent the best credit metrics in the industry.
As I say each quarter our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate but to achieve the best economic gain when we invest.
Next is Slide 11; so these are the lending reserve coverage ratios.
So each of the metrics whether it’s reserves as a percentage of loans reserves as a percentage of past dues or the principal months coverage are lower in the first quarter of 2013 compared to last year based on the improved credit metrics and are trending slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2012 as we continue to sustain historically low credit metrics.
Our reserves in these metrics are appropriate for the risks that are inherent in our portfolio.
Slide 12; so this is expense performance.
You can see on the bottom right that total expenses grew 1% year-over-year.
Marketing and promotion expense decreased 2% reflecting lower brand advertising partially offset by higher card acquisition spending.
I’ll cover this in more detail in the slide.
Next is cardmember rewards expense and this increased 4% reflecting higher spending on rewards products partially offset by slower growth in membership rewards ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012.
I’ll cover this in more detail on the following slide.
Cardmember services decreased slightly.
Total operating expense grew 1% lower than our target of growing total operating expense less than 3% for the next two years and I have a slide on this later as well.
The effective tax rate was 32.9% in the first quarter of 2013.
This compares with 29.2% in the first quarter of 2012.
So lower tax rate in the prior year includes a tax benefit related to the realization of certain tax credits.
Moving to Slide 13; so this is marketing and promotion expense.
So marketing expense in the first quarter of this year was $621 million.
That compares to $631 million in the first quarter of 2012.
So down slightly.
As you can see from the chart it’s also down slightly for marketing as a percentage of revenue.
So all the way on the right you can see the percentage for the first quarter of this year was 7.9% and for last year in the first quarter it was 9.3%.
But we remain committed to our objective of having marketing and promotion expense to approximate 9% of revenues on an annual basis.
While in the first quarter of 2012 this percentage was 8.3% if you look at the chart on the right you can see that we increased spending in the second through fourth quarter to achieve our annual objective and you can see on the left hand chart that 2012 for the full year came in at 9.2%.
We continue to invest in our business despite the slow growth economy.
Slide 14 we’ve cardmember rewards expense.
So rewards expense in the first quarter of this year was $1.520 billion.
That compares to $1.467 billion in the first quarter of 2012 a 4% increase.
So cardmember rewards expense is a combination of rewards on co-brand products and membership rewards expense.
Within membership rewards it is a combination of expense of points earned in the current period and this is included in the chart along with co-brand expense in the dark blue section of the chart.
This section of the bar basically grows with the growth in billed business.
Membership rewards expense also includes expense related to changes in the membership rewards liability for points previously earned.
This is the green section of the bar.
As you can see this portion of expense in the first quarter of 2013 is lower than the first quarter of 2012 as the increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 was less than the increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2012.
The ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 is 94% the same as it was in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Next slide is Slide 15 operating expense performance.
In the quarter as you can see in the lower right operating expense increased only 1% versus the prior year as we continue to focus on controlling expenses.
Our expense performance is consistent with our aim to have operating expense grow at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next two years.
Salaries and employee benefits decreased 1% reflecting a decrease in employee count of 1 100 people compared to the first quarter of 2012.
Professional services increased 4% reflecting increased investments in the business and higher legal fees.
Occupancy and equipment increased 8% driven by higher data processing costs and software amortization.
Other net decreased 2% and this is resulting from a favorable impact related to hedging of fixed rate exposures versus an expense in the first quarter of 2012.
So this is an accounting adjustment we need to record.
These hedges are functioning exactly the way we intended and over the life of the hedge it will move to zero.
Now we go to Slide 16; so this is expense as a percentage of revenue.
Now adjusted expense means we’re excluding credit provision.
On the left side you can see six years of history and on the right side you can see the most recent five quarters.
The 2010 and 2011 reflect elevated investment levels.
In 2012 we committed to migrate this ratio over time back towards historical levels in two ways; first through revenue growth and second our plans to control operating expense while continuing to invest in the business.
In the bars for 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2012 the dotted line in the bar excludes the restructuring charge and cardmember reimbursements in the fourth quarter of 2012.
As you can see on the chart on the right we are making substantial progress in reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenues.
Moving to Slide 17; so these are capital ratios.
In the first quarter of 2013 Tier 1 Tier 1 common and total capital ratios increased due to an increase in capital during the period primarily driven by capital generation of $1.5 billion.
This is a combination of $1.3 billion in net income and $200 million raised from employee plans.
Offset by capital distributions of $1.1 billion and this is $800 million in share repurchases and $300 million in dividends as well as a decrease in risk-weighted assets mostly due to lower cardmember loans.
Tier 1 common capital ratio of 12.6% provides the company with a strong capital position.
Next is Slide 18; this is the total payout ratio.
So this is the percentage of capital generated through net income returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases.
On the left hand side we see the past five years.
On the right side we see the most recent five quarters.
In 2012 we returned $4 billion or 98% to shareholders.
Now the share repurchase in the first quarter of 2013 was governed by our CCAR submission in January of 2012 and so for the quarter we returned 70% of net income.
We plan to increase our dividend to $0.23 per share from $0.20 per share next quarter a 15% increase for shareholders.
We are also moving ahead with plans to repurchase common shares that will total up to $3.2 billion to shareholders during remainder of this year to total of $4 billion in 2013 and up to an additional $1 billion in the first quarter of 2014.
Next slide is Slide 19 our liquidity snapshot.
Our objective is to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities.
As you can see we have $20.9 billion in excess cash compared to funding maturities of $17 billion for next year thereby meeting our objective.
Next is Slide 20.
So this is our U.S.
retail deposit program and it shows you the deposits by type.
As you can see on the right the deposits increased by $1.1 billion in the quarter with direct deposits increasing by $2.5 billion and you can see that on the left side of the chart.
We remain committed to increasing direct deposits over time.
So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.
We continue to feel positive about our performance especially given the slow growth economic environment.
In the quarter spend growth continue to be healthy and was relatively consistent with the past several quarters despite the negative impact of having an extra billing day in the first quarter 2012 because of Leap Year.
We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpace the industry.
Moderate loan growth and slightly higher net yields led to a 10% increase in net interest income.
At the same time lending loss rates remained near all-time lows.
Revenue growth was 5% on an FX adjusted basis consistent with last quarter.
This reflects the sluggish economic environment and the negative impact of having one less day in the quarter versus the prior year.
In the quarter operating expense increased only 1% versus the prior year as we continue to focus on controlling expenses.
Our expense performance is consistent with our aim to have operating expense growth at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next two years.
We’re also continuing to invest in the business and expect full year marketing and promotion expense to be approximately 9% of total revenues in line with our historical average.
EPS growth of 7% outpaced revenue growth reflecting the progress we have made on controlling operating expense and our strong capital position.
We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks while maintaining strong capital ratios.
The results of the recent Fed stress test underscore our capital strength and our ability to remain profitable even under severe stress assumptions.
Risk flow in capital position provides flexibility we are planning to afford 15% increase in our dividend during the second quarter and allow us to balance the capital needs of our business with the potential for significant share buybacks.
We recognized that our business is not immune to the economic environment but we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to shareholders even in an extended slow growth environment.
Thanks for listening and I’m now ready to take your questions.
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Ryan Nash representing Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead.
Hi thanks hi Dan.
When you think about your outlook for revenue growth that came in about 5% on FX-adjusted basis quarter below when you’re factoring the FX.
So if you’d assume that the revenue trends remain consistent over the next few quarters how should we think about OpEx growth for the remainder of the year? I know you’re staying less than 3% but assuming revenues were to stay at the 5% level do you think we should end up on the low end of that range? So as we talked about staying having growth of less than 3% we really haven’t factored in exactly where revenue growth is going to come in.
So I don’t think that’s the factor in terms of our commitment to keep OpEx growth at less than 3%.
Got it and… So at the FCA we’re trying to give a variety of scenarios in there in terms of what the potential outcomes could be when you vary both revenue growth and operating expense growth and share repurchases to give you a sense of how each of those items could affect EPS in the several different scenarios.
Okay and in terms of the spend volumes can you give us a sense of how they progressed during the quarter end? At this point have you seen anything that points a pull back on the part of consumers from higher tax rates? So our spending levels our FX-adjusted basis have been pretty consistent over two quarters and we didn’t see any historic trends within the quarter.
So whether the change in the tax rate is having a impact that was something that we could concern within our numbers.
Great thanks.
Question today comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Please go ahead.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</strong> Yeah thank you.
I was hoping if I can get like some specifics around the gain that you guys had from the sale of the ICB shares as well as kind of those benefitted from the reversal of the reserve for cardmember reimbursements? And then secondly I was just wondering how far we were into the restructuring that you guys have undertaken and at what point during the year will we hit a level of operating expense ex-marketing without that overhead? Thank you.
Okay.
So as we relates to the ICBC shares we put a hedge on that in the past and have effectively locked in the gain.
As you have seen over the last several quarters we are taking that over time and the reason we’re doing that is to enable higher levels of investment spending to help generate business momentum.
So it’s a locked in gain we have in sort of time our plan to take it over time.
With respect to your second question about the reversal of our reserve we put up previously related to cardmember reimbursements.
We have come up with an estimate in the fourth quarter upon further refinements we realize that the announcement we’re going to reimburse is actually lower in our estimate.
It’s a relatively small amount but it did have an effect on the increase in spreads.
So I didn’t want people to think that that was a permanent increase that’s really the only reason I spiked it out but it’s not really a large number at all as it relates to our income.
In terms of restructuring we announced restructuring in January; the impact of employees leaving American Express is actually going to take place over all of 2013.
Some have left in March but others will not leave until later in the year.
So we’re only get a portion of the benefit from that actions in 2013 and we’ll get an additional benefit in 2014 as some people would have been here for a portion of 2013.
So it’s going to come to us very gradually over 2013 and 2014.
And I would say most employees the first employees to leave were probably in the March timeframe.
So there is a limited amount of benefit from that in the first quarter.
So we really see it come to us over the next seven quarters I would say.
The very good control of operating expense is just our continued focus on operating expense which we really started last year which is rolling over into this year as we see the proper control of expense as a way of creating resources so that we can invest in the business some of which takes place on marketing portion line other portions of that actually take place on the operating expense line.
So I don’t even know it was only one question.
I hope I got each of the four parts correct.
You there? Question? The next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.
Please go ahead.
Inc.</strong> Thanks.
Good evening.
Dan I had a follow-up question on slide 16 and the detail that you gave on the expenses.
So you’re clearly making progress on reducing expenses but I wanted to kind of make sure that I was thinking about the commentary that you guys have made correctly.
You referred to how in the past that you intended to get debt expense ratio down to historical levels and I thought that you had said in the past that 2007 was kind of a good benchmark so that kind of 67% level and you’re at 69% now in first quarter 2013 and we see the progress you’ve made there.
But should we be thinking is that in fact a fair way to be thinking about it that that 69% over time is going to move towards 67%? And I know you guys don’t want to get locked into a timeframe but let’s call it the next 12 months to 18 months or so kind of a reasonable timeframe to be thinking about.
Yeah.
So I think what we said is we want to move back towards historical levels and 2008 and 2009 are low because it was during the crisis and 2010 to 2011 are higher because we had all the levels of investment.
Soon we’ll lock in exactly on the 67% and certainly want to head back in that direction.
How much we actually think this ratio down to will depend on lot of things including where our revenue growth is what’s in place of provision and what we’re aiming for in terms of what we want to free up for investment capacity.
So all those things work together in terms of the pace and the level that we take this ratio to.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
Thanks.
And finally as a follow-up can you give a little bit more color on what drove some of the weakness in GCS billed business and then should we expect reserve bills for the rest of the year or should we be looking for more releases? And then I guess the last part of that is the travel commissions and fees were little bit lower than what we were expecting.
So I wondered if there is any kind of maybe you could if there is anything behind that and any kind of impact from the restructuring that we should expect to impact this line item? Thanks.
Okay.
So let me talk to GCS so corporate services.
So really across the broad we’ve seen lower spending in T&amp;E categories right and we are seeing better strength outside of the T&amp;E categories.
Corporate services is primarily T&amp;E type of spending and so that’s where you see it come down and that’s relatively broad geographically.
So it’s just lower T&amp;E type of spending as it’s causing them to be lower and that actually ties into travel commissions and fee right.
So if T&amp;E spending is lower then that way it is going to be impacted.
Worldwide sales were down 3% that’s the main driver.
Now business travel was down 4% consumer was actually up 2% but business travel is much larger than consumer travel and so that’s yielding the lower sales so it’s the activity in this particular category.
In terms of reserve what’s going to happen with reserves so we have seen them come down for the last couple of years actually in the fourth quarter we had a slight reserve billed but a return this year to a release but the release was much lower.
The way our models work they use the last 12 months worth of information to do the modeling to the extend we get to a point where the core of it is falling out this is about the same level as the metrics we have in store.
Then you are going to have relatively stable provision so it’s a relationship of what’s kind of pulling out of the model and what the new quarter going into the model is.
So I think most people are anticipating that reserve releases are not going to be in 2013 what they were in prior periods.
Inc.</strong> Okay thank you.
The next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries Barclays.
Please go ahead.
Inc.</strong> Yeah thanks.
Dan could you walk us through your thoughts behind your revised buyback request under the CCAR process.
You only missed the FED’s Tier 1 common buffer by 3 basis points but then when the subsequent request lowered the buyback request by $1.5 billion was it communicated to you that would not be allowed to return in excess of 100% of earnings or alternatively did you just want to make sure that you had a really conservative request around 100% that you were confident that they would approve? Right so they never said to us you can’t be above a 100% I think stage two it’s in fact above 100%.
And it turns out before our submission and subsequently.
So that was not it.
Our initial plan we asked for an increase of dividend to $0.23.
We asked for a share repurchase of $4.7 billion all the remainder of ’13 and $1 billion in the first quarter of next year.
Our revised submission we were asking for the same $0.23 dividend.
We dropped our request from $4.7 billion to $3.2 billion this year in cap.
The request for the first quarter of next year is the same.
So when we prepared our initial submission to the FED under the stress scenario it was based on our own internal analysis and that internal analysis yielded a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 9.2% which was above the 5% minimum threshold that the FED reserve has set.
However when the Federal Reserve did its own modeling it generated a confusion that dropped us below that 5% minimum amount.
Now the good thing is both on our scenarios and their scenarios even in the stress situation we have a hue of the process over the nine quarter period.
However the FED’s projection of the loan loss provision was $3.1 billion higher than ours.
And was actually $4.6 billion higher than the analysis they had done the prior year right? So in 2012 their estimates and ours were relatively close.
Our net estimates for 2013 was similar assumptions were 2013 and 2012 were similar.
Okay what the FED has come out in the report that they published they said that some of the reserve models that the FED was using this year had changed substantially all were newly implemented.
So it was that change that caused us to fall below the 5% minimum.
Now as we thought about our revise submission.
We didn’t want to putting a submission that just eked us barely over the 5% and we said where we go back to the request that we have made in ’12 we thought that was substantial in terms of what we were returning to shareholders and that’s what really drove us at the end of the day.
And based on that when you do that and reduce the share buyback request under the FEDs stress scenario our Tier 1 common ratio comes in at 6.42% a healthy amount of 5%.
So that was really our thinking in how we set our resubmitted request.
Inc.</strong> Okay I got it.
On a separate fact when I look at a year or so back the delta between your billed business growth and loan growth was 10% plus and I understand you are telling us then you would eventually expect lend to follow spend and those would converge but now it’s relatively tied I guess there is only about a 240 basis point difference between your proprietary billed business growth and your loan growth which is actually a little bit tighter than I would expect it given your more spend based model is that relationship in line what you would have expected or is it a sign that you are getting more growth from your revolvers than you are from your transactors here? So given that pre-crisis our loans grew at about the same pace as the growth in billings on lending products okay that’s separated while during the crisis as consumers started to de-leverage.
What we have said I think is that what the growth in loans will be in relation to the business is totally depended on our customers.
Right they are going to decide what amount of leverage that they want to have although intuitively at least in the near term didn’t seen that we moved back to where we were pre-crisis.
In the fourth quarter loan growth came closer to billings growth but in the first quarter the growth in loans was about half the rate of the growth in billed business it is kind of been about that level for several quarters.
Now whether it goes up or down from there as I said depending on the customers we give products to customers we give them the opportunity to revolve if they choose as you know probably the number of customers that we have that have lending products that are actually transactors they are very much in the high 20s right.
But if those customers choose to revolve the products design to allow so it will be driven not by us but by the choice of the customer and we will rely on the credit capabilities we have to properly monitor that and you can see that while we are having loan growth even though really no one else in the industry is at the moment our credit metrics were excellent.
So it’s really be driven by the behavior of the customer.
Inc.</strong> Okay thanks.
Next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with the Citigroup.
Please go ahead.
Dan sort of looking at billed business in the U.S I mean effectively your growth rates you could argue accelerated a bit and you’ve got the banks and JPMorgan sort of coming at the affluent side I mean I guess my question is do you still think you are gaining share how is growth so stable and good.
I mean is there anything specific in terms of sort of a income breakdown where they super affluent is maybe stronger I mean are you just seeing across the board decent numbers? Our customer basis is primarily affluent customer base and as I said before we don’t see any discernible impact of taxes on our base.
As you said in the U.S we had some pretty consistent performance over the last several quarters that we are pleased with given where GDP is and the fact that it’s a sluggish economy.
Now we always have the fact that lots of our competitors want to be in our space and we mean to continue to innovate and provide to as a service to customers to maintain the kind of performance that we have but and we haven’t done analysis to distinguish by income level within our customer base but it’s pretty good performance over of what based of our products that’s giving us this stable growth.
Thank you.
And then in terms of the Chase Visa deal I guess some have suggested that maybe that could be a competitor for us to AmEx because of the closed loop.
I mean is there anything specific that they could do that’s incremental is there any sort of incremental competitive threat from that you see today? Well they’re trying to replicate our closed loop.
I think people realized that that has value.
But the number of customers that actually operate within that space is limited.
Right it has to be a Chase customer and a merchant that uses their merchant-acquiring process.
And we add that all up I don’t think that’s a very large piece of the total universe.
So is it something that will enable them to achieve growth.
I think it likely is but I don’t see it as a large threat as our closed loop covers all our merchants and all of our customers.
Thank you.
Now we’ll go to line of Ken Bruce representing Bank of America.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Good evening.
Firstly I appreciate the commentary in your prepared remarks as it relates to the marketing and promotion expense and expense levels in general.
I do want to make sure I understand some of your comments there and my question will tie in with some of the others.
But firstly you’d mentioned that marketing and promotion expense running at 7.9% in the quarter likely going to go higher just in terms of where you expect to run it on a more stable state basis and I want to make sure that that’s your outlook is for marketing promotion as a percentage of managed revenue to rise.
And then within the context of your marketing and promotion expenses you had pointed out that brand advertising was down and acquisition costs or acquisition spending was up.
And I want to understand maybe you can dimensionalize if there has been any changes in terms of what is the discretionary side of the expense versus what is more cardmember behavior if you have seen any change in the outlook for where you want to invest whether that would be geographically or within products and get a sense as to how you are looking at the investment horizon if you could provide some color on those areas please? So what we have said is our objective is for marketing and promotion on an annual basis to be about 9% it’s not a forecast that that’s our objective.
I was just putting out that last year we had got marketing as a percentage of revenue down in the first quarter.
We’ve done that again.
But again we aren’t changing our objective of being at that 9% level.
The commentary say we took brand down a little bit and acquisition up a little bit was going to say we had a strategy change in terms of the mix which is say during this quarter when we had lower expenses coming more from the brand side and that our acquisition engine to bringing customers was actually at or little above what we have in the past.
So it’s really just to give you a sense of how we allocate within the quarter.
Every year we look at all of the opportunities we have in terms of where we spend our marketing dollars whether it’s on brand or charge in the U.S.
or charge internationally our lending products or co-branded products.
And we have pretty refined models in terms of what the expected economic gain of those investments are and that’s what really drives where we put the dollars.
Obviously it’s a lot easier to measure when you do an acquisition because you can see the actual cards that come in and we have a pretty good idea how they’re going to perform but I guess things like brand advertising if you don’t have that nice mathematical calculation.
We know this is certain amount that you want to do.
And if you do you will have good products and good brand advertising and that’s where you want to be.
Because it’s really driven by which investments give us the greatest economic gain it will drive what geography and what products we put the investments behind.
And as a follow-up are you when you look at brand versus acquisition expenditures it feels that the branding is very discretionary but ultimately as a longer payback window versus you know the acquisition investments that you maybe making which are harder to pullback and trying to get a sense as to how much of this maybe in reaction to meeting some shorter term financial objectives versus any change in the overall outlook for investment in your business? Well I think we need so for the marketing and promotion just about maybe not 100% but very very large it's completely discretionary.
Right Then we can decide to either do or not do so it’s not like a fixed cost of having employees within the company.
So it is just a matter of I think we recognized that we can take marketing and promotion down in any quarter or for a couple of quarters in fact as we did back in ‘08 and ‘09.
And there is really no negative impact to the franchise you couldn’t do that longer-term.
So this is just in recognizing in the first quarter.
We’ve taken it down some.
We’re committed to hit the objective that we set and we chose in this particular quarter to have brand come down and acquisition go up but that can change from quarter-to-quarter depending on what we’re endeavoring to achieve.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Next we’ll go to line of Chris Brendler representing Stifel.
Please go ahead.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</strong> Hi thanks.
Good evening.
Dan if you could gently touch on the lending business one more time.
The margin seems to pop up a little bit in the first quarter.
Anything going on there is it sustainable.
And also just sitting back a little bit the lending business also seems to be going fairly well.
As you mentioned you’re doing receivables better than almost anyone in the industry the margins are healthy credits at all-time lows.
Any change in strategy around lending and given that this the weakness in other parts of the business is there any desire to increase your focus on lending and can you just comment at all on your use of teaser rates currently? Thanks.
All right.
So I’ll start with teaser rates.
So others are using balanced transfers with zero for a certain period of time.
That is not a strategy that we are following.
So we’re not growing loans by putting teaser rates out there.
The growth in our loans is coming by as a result of cardmember spending the business spending on our products which is what we want them to do.
Coming out of the crisis we did have a shift in our lending strategy right.
So we weren’t coming out of the crisis to be focused on premium lending right.
So that was a change.
So that’s really a change that we put in place back in 2009 and we’ve continued to execute against that.
We’ve shared information about what percentage of lending customers actually are transactors and that has increased quite a bit over the last several years and as a result of the premium lending strategy we’re focused on cards that have higher spending on them so we have also shared the percentage of customers who have a tenure of less than 2.5 years with us so there is a lot less than it was again five years because we are bring fewer products right? Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</strong> Right That’s helpful from our credit perspective as well so I think you’re putting a number of metrics out there show that we not only talking about a premium lending strategy but actually executing against it.
We can actually see that average cardmember spending is in the whole base is growing up.
So that has been something of a change because changing some strategy changes that we made a couple of years ago.
Lending products for credit worthy customer our products that have good economics associated with it and so we were grow both charge card and premium lending and as I said before which ones we are actually investing against is based on the return that we think we’ll get out of each investment.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</strong> Any comment on the manager’s margin and then also separately can you also comment on fraud? I heard more and more concerned about fraud but the lack of EMB in the U.S.
and this year plan to start issuing EMB cards in the U.S.
an update there.
Thanks.
So net yield is at 9.5% in the quarter up about 30 basis points from last year I made a comment that a part of that increase had to do with adjusting of our reserves I wouldn’t expect to stay at exactly 9.5%.
Coming out of the crisis or actually coming out of the new regulations that we had.
We had said 9% was about our yield prior to those regulations and our intend was for our yield to be about 9% after those regulations with the changes we have made in our products so we have achieved that and slightly more.
So on our lending products we are getting good growth low credit losses and good yields and that’s a pretty good combination to have right.
So we are very pleased with how our lending products are performing.
As it relates to fraud our fraud losses are less than half of what we see across the industry and I think that’s the benefit of having very good gross proceeds to money growth it’s probably one of the benefits of closed loop and we have not seen any notable tick-up in fraud in our core business.
As it relates to EMV we have started to put EMV chips on some of our premium products or products for customers who travel expensively so that they have the best utilization possible quite frankly outside the U.S.
but I think gradually within the U.S.
we put EMV on to our cards over a number of years.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</strong> No big roll out plan for this year Dan? It’s going to be a very gradual roll out over several years I would say so no big push to do it in 2013 but it’s a gradual undertaking for us.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</strong> Great.
Thank you so much.
Next we will go to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
Hi good evening.
Hi.
Couple of questions; one is just on the travel segment.
Travel segment have been relatively weak thinking about just airline and airline seat capacity and I’m wondering how much of that may have impacted your first quarter in terms of billed business.
Yeah.
So I think I mentioned before the reason that Corporate Services was down in terms of growth rate the growth rate was lower was that we were seeing weakness in T&amp;E spend compared to our average.
So we saw that in all of our products.
It’s a bigger percentage of Corporate Services.
So it had a bigger impact there.
So it was impacting growth in the quarter.
Okay but no sense of degree of impact? It’s hard to tease out exactly.
I guess I would say that was little bit overall we’re very pleased with our aggregate growth rate given the sluggish economy.
Sure.
And then on slide five just looking at the different billed business growth rates per region it’s kind of interesting that they’re somewhat coming together fairly tightly and I’m wondering how you guys are thinking about that is this new normal where distribution of growth rate across the globe is likely to be running more similarly or do you have a different outlook than what you experienced this quarter? Yeah.
I think there have been times when it kind of moves together like it is now and I think to be a time where it performs again.
Let’s say EMEA is slower than the other regions and so kind of figure out exactly all the issues and problems.
It could well be in the EMEA space kind of in the lower part of the chart.
We think JAPA is being impacted by China.
So it’s good growth rates but not the growth rates that they had in recent history that impacts countries like Australia.
So it’s really very much going to be driven by the economies in those regions in large part.
Sure.
Okay.
And then just lastly couple of questions on Bluebird.
I wanted to understand the impact of adding a checking feature and the FDIC insurance on Bluebird and if there has been much in a way of any effort to expand the merchant acceptance to attract more Bluebird spend? So Bluebird products were all reloadable products are accepted across our whole network right.
So you can use any of those products in any location where American Express product is accepted.
The FDIC insurance we put on because it refer some customers that they matter and also to load certain checks like government checks or your tax refund bond it had to be FDIC insured.
And in terms of the check writing we just want to have a full suite of options for customers.
So it’s the best possible product for them.
So have you seen any uptick in growth rate beyond what you were experiencing before post the FDIC announcement? Well they just went on.
So it’s hard to measure but we are seeing healthy in renewable prepaid across that product set.
And then the question on the merchant acceptance.
Again that BlueBird is accepted at any merchant who access AmEx.
So I guess the question is does a reloadable prepaid card user seek a potentially different kind of merchant addition to the merchants that AmEx has today? So we say it’s possible but we do have an initiative to so we’ve always had initiative to expand merchant coverage.
So I think a small merchants is a particular initiative within 2013 and we’re trying to expand it.
So it’s very much in line it will be good for customers who use reloadable prepaid will be good for our customers who use our corporate card as well.
So let’s do the next question if you could.
Thanks.
This will be the last question.
Well two more questions.
Two more questions.
Okay.
All right.
Next we’ll go to line of Brad Ball with Evercore.
Please go ahead.
Thanks Dan.
A lot of my questions have been asked.
Just you mentioned that you were experiencing higher cash back rewards.
Is that a contra-revenue item and how many of your – what proportion of your customers are using cash back? but it’s still a reasonably healthy product within our suite of products.
And is it a product that resembles the products that are in the market 1% type cash back on all outstanding that kind of product? Well these products is a little different but it’s basically a percentage of spend you get and sometimes there is higher rewards in particular categories either on a product feature basis or on a promotion basis.
Okay.
And then one other.
You had mentioned that other revenue were helped by higher loyalty partner revenues.
Yeah.
Can you give us a sense as to the magnitude of the contribution there and just broadly how are you tracking to the $3 billion target for fee revenues? So we’ll be partnered as a substantial business.
However it’s one business in a very large company but they are performing nicely very much in line with our expectations and it’s the one spot that we think is going to help us achieve our $3 billion target.
As we said we are kind of halfway through the timeframe of achieving that target which we still think is appropriate.
It will be different fee businesses like certified royalty edge royalty partner revolver prepaid that we’re looking forward to get us there.
And as of 2012 we stood at $1.5 billion that was up 15% from the prior year.
We recognized $3 billion an ambitious target particularly in a sluggish economy and we had a fair amount of work to do as we go forward.
Our royalty partner reloadable prepaid are two examples of how we’re diversifying our base and we expect those to ramp up as we hit towards the end of 2014 which is when we’re shooting to be at a run rate of $3 billion.
That’s great.
Thanks.
Last question.
Our final question today will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead.
Great thanks.
Just to comment about the bank stock gain could you just tell us how much is left in that that you’re releasing kind of overtime when you said you needed the earnings for marketing purposes? And I’ve got a follow-up? So we’ve taken gains I think over the past six quarters or so seven quarters the hedge still runs for into next year sometime probably towards the middle of next year.
So I would expect we’re going to take gains pretty evenly over the next six or seven quarters.
All right.
And just on the reserving I mean if you kind of take the analysis that you described and look at what kind of forward 12 months would have been at the end of this quarter versus at the beginning you're kind of down 3% or 4% in terms of charge-offs.
But I guess given that…? Could you start the sentence again because I didn’t catch up with you? Yeah sure.
Basically you had said that with respect to reserving that you kind of look at the forward kind of 12 month losses and if a quarter drops out that had higher losses and in that exact analysis I mean taken literally your losses are down 3% or 4%.
So kind of with the reserve drop we saw seems reasonable.
How do you factor in the idea of growth because you've gone from 14 months of coverage at the current rate to 13 which kind of implies that you're not leaving as much room for either growth or any kind of deterioration in the existing rate.
We actually use 12 months looking back.
All right so we use historical information to seat our models.
That’s striving the reserve.
Okay.
So the growth has nothing to do with it expected loan growth? No we’re looking at the behavior of our portfolio right? And if you have loan growth we’re assuming I guess apparently that loan growth will have a similar loss aspect to it as our existing book of business.
And we’re not putting reserves on our books today for loans that we put on in the future.
So this is what is the reserve you need for the loans that are already booked at this moment.
Got you.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay so thanks everybody for joining the call.
Take care.
Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and using the AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference Service.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.
Later there will be an opportunity for questions.
(Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded.
And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Senior Vice President Investor Relations Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Welcome and thank you for joining us for today’s call.
The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
The words believe expect anticipate estimate optimistic intend plan aim will should could likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the Company’s financial and other goals are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company’s 2012 10-K and Q1 2013 10-Q already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2013 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Dan Henry Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some key points related to the quarter’s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Before I turn the discussion over to Dan I did want to acknowledge that this will be Dan’s last earnings call as our CFO.
He will be leaving Amex after a distinguished 23 year career including the past six years as CFO where he has played an important role in building relationships with the investment community.
On behalf of all of my colleagues throughout the finance organization I want to sincerely thank Dan for his many contributions and to wish him the best of luck on his retirement.
I also want to recognize that Jeff Campbell is joining us on the call today.
Jeff joined Amex from McKesson Corporation where he was Executive Vice President and CFO of the largest healthcare services company in the U.S.
Jeff will be assuming CFO duties in early August after we file our second quarter financial results and are we are excited to have him as part of American Express.
And with that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Okay.
Thanks Rick.
So I’ll start on slide two the second quarter 2013 summary of financial performance slide.
Total revenues came in at $8.2 billion.
That’s 4% higher than a year ago.
On an FX adjusted basis it’s also 4%.
In the first quarter the growth rates were 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX adjusted basis.
I will speak about the impact of cardmember reimbursements on revenue growth a little later.
Net income came in at $1.4 billion 5% higher; EPS is $1.27 10% higher as you can see the benefit of our share buyback program.
And on the last line you can see that shares outstanding are declining.
Return on average equity was 24% in the second quarter.
Without the three adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2012 as this is a 12-month rolling calculation ROE in the second quarter of 2013 would be 27%.
Moving to slide three our metric performance; billed business came in at $237 billion.
That’s 7% higher or 8% higher on an FX adjusted basis.
That compares to the first quarter when we grew at 6% reported and 7% FX adjusted.
So this quarter it’s about 100 basis points better growth rate than the first quarter.
Total cards in force are $104 million.
That’s a growth of 4%.
Proprietary cards grew 2% which is comparable to what we’ve seen in recent quarters.
Average basic cardmember spending is $4 097 in the quarter.
That’s up about 4% and reflects the continued strong cardmember engagement that we have seen.
Cardmember loans are $63 billion.
That’s an increase of 3% 4% on an FX adjusted basis and reflects continued modest growth in loans.
Moving to slide four this is billed business growth by segment on an FX adjusted basis.
So total billed business the red line you can see the growth rate increased from 7% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter.
Both ICS which is International Consumer the light blue line and GCS Global Corporate Services the green line increased by about 100 basis points.
GNS the yellow line increased from 12% in the first quarter growth rate to 17% growth in the second quarter driven by continued strong growth in Japan and accelerated growth in China and Korea due to new partners and product launches.
Markets like China have high growth and are strategically important.
Moving to slide five so this is billed business growth by region.
So the U.S.
the dark blue line growth is 7% consistent with the first quarter.
EMEA the light blue line and LACC the yellow line both have increased their growth rate compared to the first quarter.
EMEA is growing at 6% and LACC at 10%.
JAPA the green line increased from 9% growth to 13% growth driven by Japan China and Korea.
So before I leave this regional section let me just comment on EC draft proposal that has been in the news today.
We put out a press release earlier today based on how the preliminary report has been characterized to us and we made a number of points.
First the publication of the formal proposal by the commission will start a lengthy legislative process and review period.
We expect these proposals to prompt extensive debate among many market participants.
The proposals focus primarily on and cap interchange fees charged by four-party payment systems such as Visa and MasterCard.
The discount rate that American Express charges to merchants would not be regulated.
Our proprietary consumer and corporate card businesses are not covered by the pricing caps.
Three-party systems such as American Express would only be covered when they license other institutions to issue cards as in our Global Network Services business.
GNS represents a relatively small percentage of our European business.
The provisions that focus on separating the payment network and processing functions do not appear to impact proprietary networks like ours.
Given the potential impact on consumers and competition within the European payments sector American Express has been in touch with senior policy makers at the Commission and will continue to represent its positions vigorously throughout the process.
Now let me be more specific what we mean by GNS represents a relatively small percentage of our European business.
EMEA represents about $100 billion of billed business in 2012.
GNS billed business in European Union markets are less than 15% of total EMEA billed business.
On page 110 in our Annual Report in footnote number 25 EMEA pre-tax income for 2012 was $505 million.
GNS European Union pre-tax income was approximately 12% of EMEA pre-tax income in 2012.
So I just wanted to dimensionalize that further for you.
There are many aspects to the EC draft proposal.
They will play out over time.
Some will impact us directly some will impact us indirectly.
We are accustomed to changing business environments and reacting to them in an appropriate manner and we will do the same in this situation.
So let me go to slide six.
So this is U.S.
Consumer Card loans.
So the bar represents U.S.
cardmember loans and they totaled $54.6 billion in the second quarter of this year.
We have a growth rate of 4% and that’s the same as the past two quarters.
As I mentioned before worldwide loans grew 3% and 4% on an FX adjusted basis.
The 4% loan growth is driven by growth in billed business.
Loan growth is about half the rate of growth in billings on our lending products.
Net interest yield which is at the bottom of this chart is up 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012.
It is down sequentially from the first quarter of 2013 which included a reserve reversal for cardmember reimbursements that have been set up in prior periods.
As you’ll see in a minute our credit performance continues to be excellent.
But let me comment on interest rates which have been the focus area in the industry before I move to the next slide.
As disclosed in our 10-K 100 basis point immediate increase in all interest rates would reduce the Company’s net interest income by approximately $220 million over a one-year period.
Historically an increase in long-term rates generally has a minimal impact on our business.
However movements in short-term rates impact earnings.
The impact is primarily driven by the fact that we fund a portion of charge card receivables and transacting loan balances which should not have interest rate revenue streams with variable rate debt.
However historically in rising interest rate environments has also coincided with strong billings and revenue growth.
So let me move to slide seven revenue performance.
But before I go do a review of the individual P&amp;L line items I want to touch on cardmember reimbursements which is driven by our continuing commitment to proactively review card practices identify any issue and remediate them quickly.
In both the second quarter of 2013 and second quarter of 2012 these efforts resulted in costs that impacted year-over-year variances on some of our P&amp;L lines.
The overall cost related to this work was similar in both this quarter and the second quarter of 2012.
However in the current quarter most of the reimbursements were recorded in revenue reducing revenue.
Therefore the revenue growth rate in the second quarter of this year which was 4% on both our reported and FX adjusted basis would have been 5% on an FX adjusted basis excluding the impacts of the cardmember reimbursements same as the first quarter of 2013.
A year ago most of the costs were reported in operating expense.
The operating expense growth rate in the second quarter of this year is lower due to the reimbursement costs incurred in the prior year.
And I’ll provide more detail on adjusted operating expense on slide 13.
We’ve also included a reconciliation of the adjustments in Annex 9.
We continue to place a premium on self identifying and resolving any customer related issue and we clearly believe that this is the right thing to do for our customers.
Now let me go through the specific line items on slide 7.
Discount revenue increased 6% reflecting 7% growth in billed business partially offset by a decrease in discount rate and faster growth in GNS billings than the overall Company billings growth rate.
The discount rate is 2.52% in the second quarter of this year down 2 basis points from the second quarter of 2012 and flat with the first quarter of 2013.
Net card fees increased 5% as we had higher average fees per card due to fee increases also due to the increase in the number of proprietary Cards-in-force and a greater mix of premium products.
Travel commissions and fees decreased 5% driven by a 1% decrease in worldwide travel sales and lower supplier revenues due to the timing of certain contracts.
Other commissions and fees are up 5% due to slightly higher late fees and foreign currency conversion revenues.
Other revenue is lower by 13% due to cardmember reimbursements in the second quarter of this year which I discussed a minute ago as well as the benefit in second quarter of 2012 related to a revised estimate of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques.
The second quarter of 2013 includes a gain of $36 million related to the sale of ICBC shares.
The second quarter of 2012 had a gain of $30 million related to the sale of ICBC shares.
Net interest income increased 7% compared to the second quarter of 2012 reflecting a 3% increase in average cardmember loans.
Lower funding costs on the charge card portfolio and an increase in the worldwide net interest yield to 9.1% from 9% a year ago.
In the second quarter of 2013 our international consumer segment included the impact of some cardmember reimbursements.
Moving to slide eight provisions for losses the Charge Card provision is $38 million or 23% higher than the second quarter of 2012 and this reflects the fact that we have higher receivables up about 6% year-over-year slightly higher write-offs and a slightly lower reserve release which was $24 million this year compared to $32 million last year.
Cardmember loan provision increased $78 million or 31% reflecting lower reserve releases this year it was $25 million and last year it was $133 million.
So this is the primary driver of the higher provision expense.
That was somehow offset by lower write-offs in the second quarter of this year which were $348 million and that compares to the second quarter of 2012 write-offs of $370 million.
So provision is increasing while credit metrics remain stable or improved slightly as we’ll see on the next slide.
So slide nine our lending credit metrics on the left side of the chart you can see that we continue to have excellent write-off rates at historically low levels of 2%.
On the right side is the 30-day past due which is also stable or slightly improving and again these are historically low numbers.
As I say each quarter our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate but to achieve the best economic gains when we invest.
Moving to slide 10 so these are our lending reserve coverage metrics and you can see that reserves as a percentage of loans and principal months coverage are lower in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2012 as our credit metrics continue to either be stable or improving.
Reserves as a percentage of past due are slightly higher than the first quarter as delinquency rate has improved this quarter compared to the first quarter.
Our reserves in these metrics are appropriate to the risk in our portfolio.
So I’ll move to slide 11 which is expense performance.
So total expenses improved or grew rather 1% year-over-year.
Marketing and promotion increased 2% compared to last year and represents 9.5% of revenues and I'll cover this in more detail on the following slide.
Cardmember rewards reflect higher spending volumes on co-brand and membership reward products.
The membership reward ultimate redemption rate is 94% and that's comparable to the ultimate redemption rate that we had in the first quarter.
Cardmember services reflect enhanced benefits on our premium card products.
Total operating expense decreased 4% reflecting strong expense control as well as cardmembers reimbursement costs in Q2 2012.
And I’ll cover this on another slide as well.
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2013 was 29.6% reflecting the resolution of certain prior year tax items while discrete tax items lowered the tax rate in both the second quarter of 2013 and 2012 to be below 30%.
Over the past three quarters our tax rate has been 32% or 33% in each of those quarters.
So I’ll move to slide 12 so this is marketing and promotion expense as a percentage of managed revenues.
So marketing expense in the second quarter of this year was $786 million compared to $773 million in the second quarter of 2012.
As you can see on the right side of the chart the second quarter was 9.5% of revenues and on track to achieve 9% growth for the year or potentially slightly higher.
We continue to invest in our business despite the slow growth economy.
Moving to slide 13 so this is operating expense performance so total operating expense is 4% lower year-over-year salaries and benefit is flat year-over-year and this reflects some of the benefits from the restructuring that we announced in January.
Employee count is 1 300 lower than in the second quarter of 2012.
Employee count in the first quarter decreased to 1 100 compared to year-end 2012 but picked up slightly by 200 in the second quarter.
We estimate employee count at year-end 2013 will be 4% to 6% lower than the year end 2012.
Professional services increased reflecting higher technology development and other net decreased 48% reflecting 89 million more in cardmember reimbursements in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2013.
And you can see this on Annex 9.
The second quarter of 2012 also included an asset impairment.
The second quarter of this year includes the Canadian value added tax benefit that lowered other net expenses.
So moving to slide 14 – so this chart shows the adjusted operating expense growth over the past three years.
In 2013 and 2014 our target is to grow operating expense at less than 3% each year.
You can see the first quarter grew at 1% and while the second quarter decreased 4% after adjusting for the cardmember reimbursements I just discussed the second quarter of 2013 would have been a reduction in year-over-year expense of 1%.
So we were on track to achieve our target of less than 3% annual growth in operating expense for this year.
Moving to slide 15 so this is adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenue and this excludes credit provision.
In 2012 we committed to migrate this ratio over time back towards historical levels in two ways; first through revenue growth; and second controlling operating expense while continue to invest in the business.
In 2012 in those bars the dotted line is excluding the restructuring charge in cardmember reimbursements that we have had in the fourth quarter of 2012.
As you can see on the chart we are making substantial progress in reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenue.
Well both the first quarter and the second quarter of 2013 round to 69% the second quarter ratio is actually slightly lower than the first quarter if you carry without one more decimal point.
Slide 16 so these are our capital ratios.
In the second quarter of 2013 our Tier 1 common ratio is 12.5%.
In the quarter we generated $1.7 billion of capital $1.4 billion from net income and $300 million from employee plans.
We also distributed $1.7 billion in capital $1.4 billion through share buybacks and $300 million in dividends.
Risk weighted assets increased slightly due to higher receivables.
The Basel III implementation from Basel I would have reduced Tier 1 common by 30 basis points but I would remind you that we have not yet implemented Basel III advanced approach.
So there has been much conversation about the new supplemental leverage calculation.
So the Tier 1 leverage calculation for us as you can see on the chart is 10.5%.
If it is the calculation in the second quarter on a leverage supplementary level basis it would be 8% well above the required level of 3%.
So our Tier 1 common ratio and leverage ratio provides the Company with a strong capital position.
So moving to slide 17 so this is our payout ratio.
So our share repurchases are governed by our performance and our CCAR submission in January 2013.
Our plan for 2013 is to repurchase $4 billion.
The $1.4 billion in repurchases in the second quarter is consistent with our CCAR submission in January.
Moving to slide 18 so this is our U.S.
retail deposit balances.
So the U.S.
retail deposit activity in the quarter you can see decreased slightly.
Our overall funding strategy is to utilize unsecured securitizations and deposits.
In the second quarter we issued $2 billion of unsecured debt.
Therefore we did not need to increase deposits.
Therefore we decreased deposits slightly.
However within deposits we continue to grow direct deposits by $1.2 billion to $23.1 billion while third-party CDs and sweeps decreased slightly.
On the liquidity front we continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities.
As of June 30 we had $15.4 billion in excess cash compared to funding maturities of $14.4 billion over the next 12 months thereby meeting our objective.
So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.
We continue to feel positive about our performance especially given the relatively slow growth in the economic environment.
In the quarter our spending growth continued to be healthy and was relatively consistent with the past several quarters.
In addition we did see some improvements in our growth rate internationally.
We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpace the industry.
Loan growth and slightly lower funding costs led to a 7% increase in net interest income.
At the same time lending loss rates remain near all-time lows.
Revenue growth was 4%.
We continue to consistently grow revenues despite the slow growth environment and in this quarter the negative impact of cardmember reimbursements.
In the quarter operating expense decreased by 4% first year reflecting the strong expense control as well as higher cardmember reimbursements cost in the prior year.
We are clearly off to an excellent start with our aim of having operating expense growth at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next two years.
We’re also continuing to invest in the business as marketing and promotion and technology development spending both increased versus prior years.
These investments are driving higher average spend and growth in our cardmember base while continuing to build capabilities for the future.
Second quarter EPS were $1.27 represents an all-time high but this benefit from a lower tax rate than recent quarters.
EPS growth rate of 10% outpaced revenue growth reflecting the progress we have made on improving operating leverage and our strong capital position.
We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks while maintaining strong capital ratios.
We’ve recognized that our business is not immune to the economic environment but we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders even in a slow growth environment.
So with that let me turn it over to Jeff Campbell for a few remarks.
Well thank you Dan and good afternoon everyone.
I am excited to have joined American Express this week and I will look forward in the coming months to spending time with many of you on the call and to continuing the strong legacy of performance that Dan’s leadership has helped to create here at American Express.
So with that Rick? Thanks Jeff.
Okay so we are going to start the Q&amp;A just before we kick it off I do want to ask everybody as a courtesy to all those who do want to ask a question that we strongly encourage you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so we can get as many folks on the call as possible.
And with that let’s open up the lines for questions.
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of CLSA.
Please go ahead.
Yeah good afternoon.
Dan first let me congratulate you on your ride off into the sunset it’s been a pleasure.
Okay thank you.
A question regarding the GNS business in Europe and the 12% of the $505 million you discussed I am not sure I don’t think any of us know in terms of the breakdown of GNS revenue is there any component of that that would be susceptible to the cap that they are placing on interchange or is that strictly network and acquiring fees or is there some level of interchange split with the issuer? And as a follow-up is there any guidance going forward on cardmember reimbursements that we can think about in terms of suppression of revenue or help on expenses.
Thanks.
So yes the draft is not even out yet so getting very specific in terms of answering all the elements of your question is really not possible.
I think the main point that we wanted to make is that the cap relates to four party systems and from our understanding does not relate to three party systems which is our system therefore our proprietary business the proprietary consumer business and our corporate card business is not impacted.
However in our GNS business we think the cap will apply as a result of that we’ll have an impact directly on that business exactly how it’s going to play out will depend on exactly what the draft says and the debate that will take place between now and the time that the final rules are issued which will be several quarters in the future.
So it’s hard to be more specific at this point and it is our intent once we have a chance to read the draft to touch on this topic at the Financial Community Meeting which will take place on August 8.
In terms of cardmember reimbursements as we identify items we look for root [causes] [ph] and if there is a need for us to modify our procedures going forward we’ll do that and if it’s appropriate to have reimbursements for customers we’ll do that as well as I said in the second quarter of last year and this year the numbers are at a similar level.
It has varied from quarter-to-quarter in terms of how much it is.
Forecasting what might happen in the future is difficult because certainly anything we know about we have addressed at this juncture but certainly in the course of our work of reviewing our policies and our practices it’s potential we could identify other items and if they do we will remediate those and if appropriate have reimbursements but there is really no way to forecast what that might be.
Okay.
And the next question from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.
Please go ahead.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</strong> Thank you good evening and congrats Dan.
Just two questions; one on Europe I was just hoping if you could just talk about how you would deal with the competitive pressure of lower rates from Visa and MasterCard when domestic interchange rates go down and kind of how you would offset any potential impact to the extent that you have to take your pricing down.
And also I just wanted to get a sense of how much of your volume is commercial as well.
And then just second that Canadian VAT benefit you mentioned I just want to know how much that was.
Thank you.
Okay.
So certainly as I said there’s going to be a direct impact as it relates to GNS and the business we do with GNS partners.
And then there will be an indirect impact but that’s something again that will be very dependent on what the final rules actually say and how we need to react in the marketplace.
Certainly we have faced these types of challenges in other markets and I think we have reacted in a way that's been beneficial in terms of our overall business.
It’s hard to really specifically say what's going to happen because we don’t even know what the draft rules are exactly nor what the final rules will be.
A whole lot will take place in the marketplace.
This is something that I think will play out honestly not only over a couple of quarters but likely over a couple of years but we will be very thoughtful about how we approach that.
In terms of the commercial piece of the European business that’s not disclosure that we’ve historically made at this juncture.
I thought the most useful information that was to actually share what percentage the GNS billings were of the total billings in Europe.
So hopefully that was helpful.
Canadian benefit kind of falls in this category of an amount we thought was large enough that we should mention but not large enough to give the dollar amount which is kind of in our practice on a fair number of items like this but to let you know that there is something in there that is affecting the line item and therefore the growth rate.
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</strong> All right thank you.
Okay the next question from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities.
Please go ahead.
Inc.</strong> Thanks good evening and Dan I will also add my congratulations and it’s been a pleasure working with you.
I had a follow-up question on the comments that you made.
You made it clear that the proprietary business is not covered by the proposed caps.
Does that suggest that you will be able to generate premium economics and be able to offer greater rewards and therefore you have greater value for your customers and I guess that the logical thought process then does that put you in a position where you can experience similar results to what you saw in Australia? And I have a follow-up.
Yeah so I mean currently we have a premium position right? And that’s what enables us to provide the value in our products that we provide to our customers.
And certainly initially the gap between what our discount rates are and the cap will probably widen that gap somewhat.
But realistically we know we’ll have to react to a second place in the marketplace.
I don’t want to analogize this exactly to Australia because every market is different but what we did in Australia actually demonstrates the fact that we have a flexible business model and are thoughtful in terms of how we do react when the environment changes.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
And to address some of the concerns that are out there around regulators focusing on the three-party system can you just talk – your comments today were very helpful in the release and what you’ve said so far in the call but can you just give us I guess more broadly a perspective on whether you’ve ever heard of any regulator you have any experience with any regulator anywhere around the world really talk about bifurcating the negotiated merchant discount rate in your proprietary business with the goal of regulating it.
I think that's kind of where some people were going and it just seems I remember from past meetings that we've had with your Head of Global Merchant Services it seems pretty clear that regulators around the world kind of get your models different because your rates are negotiated.
I wonder if that's still a fair a reasonable way of thinking about it if you can just comment on that.
Thank you.
So I just said we negotiate our rates with the merchants around the world.
Certainly in Australia that regulation didn't address our rates specifically.
That was a four-party systems and your understanding of this draft as it was characterized us we don't believe addresses three-party system such as ours.
So that seems to be the course of action that happens historically and our understanding of the same plays here.
What may happen elsewhere always time will tell but that has been the focus historically when it's come to a change of regulation.
Okay.
And the next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous.
Please go ahead.
I guess maybe switching gears to capital as these Basel III rules firm up two things one is there any reason to think the advanced approach would be a meaningful change from the 12.2% Basel III you kind of implied by the 30 basis point hit; and is there any reason to think the liquidity coverage ratio is a hurdle that would be an issue in terms of the way you manage the excess liquidity? So the 30 basis points is when we go from Basel I over to Basel III kind of skipping the Basel II piece right.
It’s hard for me to say what the impact will be until we actually complete the work on the advanced Basel III methodology.
It requires the gathering of an enormous amount of information that we have to process with systems.
That work is actually underway currently.
We actually have scheduled to enter a parallel run in the beginning of 2014 at that juncture we will have a better sense of what the impact would be on capital ratios.
So I don’t have an estimate for you at this juncture.
In terms of liquidity rules I guess we don’t have final liquidity rules at this point although from what we understand so far we think we have a strong liquidity position and don’t at this moment based on our understanding think that the new ratios that will phase in over time would have a substantial impact on us.
So therefore I would say it wouldn’t necessarily have an impact on kind of how we think about liquidity at the moment.
One follow-up I guess on the other expense.
All the dimensions you gave are very helpful.
But if I just think about it simplistically I mean is the $219 million kind of a good run rate for that number or is it better to think about since the Visa and MasterCard benefit rolled off and excluding the quarters where you had the big reimbursements it’s tended to be more in the kind of $260 million to $270 million range? Well the $219 million as I said includes the Canadian item.
So I don’t know that I used that number in the first quarter.
So in the first quarter of this year we didn’t have any items that we spiked out and it was $246 million.
Perfect.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
Okay.
And next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan.
Please go ahead.
Hey.
Thank you guys for taking my questions.
And Dan I will miss these conversations and wish you all the best.
Thank you.
I’d love to talk a little bit about the nuance of your conversations with the regulators.
We’re in a situation now where it appears that the press has seen the documents and what you guys have indicated is you had conversations it doesn’t sound per se like you’ve actually seen the draft at this point.
You guys are very deliberate in your communications you’re very cautious and you come out with a strong interpretation of how this is going to play out for your guys.
I’d love to understand what the dialog was like when it started and make sure that we understand the subtlety of this because it is pretty significant as you can see from how the stock traded around all those today? Yeah.
Well I haven’t said that.
I mean we’re not necessarily intimating that the conversations of the people who have characterized this to us are the regulators right? So it is based on our understanding previously to this leak of the drafts where we would come out and based on the characterizations of those people who have seen the draft and discussed it with us our sense is that in fact notably different than what we have been thinking about before.
However we actually see the draft and get a chance to read it and digest it then we’ll all even be in a better position but as you indicated there were certainly notable discussion in the press and activity in our stocks and so we wanted our press release to share our understanding of where we are even though we haven't read the complete document.
And so that's the state of play at the moment.
After it is issued on the 24<sup>th</sup> we will read it and if there is anything – any refinements we can make we will do that at the financial committee meeting on August 8.
Great I guess we look forward to reading it at the same time you guys do.
Thanks guys.
Okay.
Okay thank you.
Next question from the line of Ken Bruce of Bank of America.
Please go ahead.
Thank you and good evening gentlemen and Dan wish you good fortune in your retirement.
So thank you very much for the help over the years.
My question I’ll stay around Europe for the moment.
Looking at the average cardmember spend that has been decelerating really for the last several quarters and that has always been one of the metrics that you all have really focused on in terms of the health of the business and obviously there has been a change in strategy at least there has been some additional products that maybe impacting the numbers but I guess what I’d like to understand is or get some response from you is how you’re seeing the deceleration in the average cardmember spend growth? What ultimately will turn that if it’s just purely the weak economy strengthening or if there is something specifically within your strategy set that will drive that or if you expect that to be less going forward just given the nature where you are adding new cards and the like? Yes so I think historically our growth in billed business has come from both the combination of the growth in Cards-in-force as well as growth in average spend.
The growth in average spend comes from really two things in recent history that is just greater engagement on the part of our current customers who are spending at higher levels but it’s also coming from our premium strategy.
So we’re bringing on higher spending customers compared to what we were doing several years ago and I think that shift to a more premium mix is influencing as well.
However well first off the broader economy has an impact here as well and certainly just consumer confidence is the fact in terms of how much people spend.
That’s been shifting a little bit recently certainly things like housing prices firming stock market doing better are all things that can influence that.
But as we have talked about a fair number of times there is pretty good correlation between billed business for us and GDP and I think the average cardmember spend numbers we see now are being impacted by the fact that GDP is below the average rate that we’ve seen over the last 10 years.
And if history is any barometer and if GDP picks up you would think it would have a positive impact on average spend.
There is obviously also totally contingent on us having the best value propositions in the marketplace and providing the best service and that’s what we are focused on.
So it’s hard to spike out exactly how each of those things impact average spend but certainly the general slow growth in the economy I think is a factor here.
Okay thank you.
And just on a clarification or maybe just if you could provide some senses to what the differences are in the cardmember reimbursements that will either determine whether it’s a revenue item or an expense can you give us some examples as to what the cause of that change please? So we think it’s each items to talk one item this quarter it’s a number of items in each quarter and each item is unique.
So each quarter we evaluate the items that are in front of us and make the judgment based on our view at that quarter of how it should be categorized so you can have different types of items in different quarters.
That’s really the thing that is the primary driver.
Okay thank you and best of luck.
Thank you.
Okay.
The next question is from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead.
Hey thanks.
Just as a follow-up on Ken’s question related to spend growth outside the acceleration we saw in GNS from new business wins.
Do you think particularly here in the U.S.
do you think the current run rates are good proxy for what we should see for spend over the next few quarters? Should we expect it to remain stable or just given the fact that we are seeing improvement from the [welfare] fact whether it’s higher home prices and higher markets should we start seeing that manifesting into higher spend? So as you know me I don’t want to forecast here I guess one of the factors is the grow over later in the year although a lot of steeper thing were earlier in the year.
But clearly I think where the economy goes and consumer confidence will also be significant factors about whether it accelerates from here or not.
Okay and then just a question on expenses so Europe 69% as a percentage of managed revenues and I know you’ve talked about migrating towards 67% over time so I guess should we expect to stay at these levels in near-term and if revenue growth does have to accelerate and we could see a pickup in expenses from here? So we say we went migrate back towards historical levels okay.
We are having to have 2007 on there which is 67% but we went and migrate back to the historical levels.
If we are successful and it’s our plan to be successful of growing operating expense at less than 3% that’s going to create leverage and should enable us to continue to improve that number over the next 18 months.
Great.
Thanks for taking my questions and congrats.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Next question is from the line of Dan Fandetti of Citigroup.
Please go ahead.
Hi Dan.
Just a conceptual question I was looking back in your merchant discount rate it’s down a couple of basis points over the last 2.5 years.
And you just had very strong GNS growth which I would think would naturally bring that down more and so.
I guess my question is do you really have any sort of core change in your merchant discount rate when should we think about that as more flattish going forward the mix? Okay so first GNS is not in the discount rate calculations it’s really a calculation based on our proprietary business so that’s not in there.
So we have said in the absence of increasing price anywhere because of our strategies drive further into everyday spend categories in the normal course we’d expect the discount rate to drop by two or three basis points a year.
We in fact have not seen that over the last several years as there have been opportunities where we are bringing greater value to merchants and then obviously we’ve been able to increase price in certain situations so that the drop in discount rate has been probably more in the 1% or 2% level over the past several years.
So if we can drive sufficient volume by moving into new categories and driving volumes up then I would expect to see some drop in discount rate as we go forward.
But that's very much on strategy for what we want to accomplish over the long-term.
Okay.
And then quickly any updates on Bluebird in terms of transaction over fees.
So I think we're going to do some updates of the data that we shared at the FCM in February at the August FCM.
So we'll update that information on August 8.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you.
And the next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna.
Please go ahead.
LLP</strong> Hi.
Thanks and let me echo the congratulations.
I want to ask about cards in force Dan.
It was one of the faster growing numbers in the past year up 1.2 million.
I guess question in two parts.
One is should that continue to be the emphasis going forward in terms of driving billed business? And two it looked like about 700 000 of that 1.2 million came from GNS.
Should we anticipate going forward that GNS will be the driver of cards in force? It sounded like in your introductory comments it suggests that some of the growth may have come from China.
Is that a correct interpretation? So cards in force number which is 4% was 2% on proprietary cards.
So that’s pretty consistent.
We’ve kind of been at the 2% 3% growth rate over the last five or six quarters.
So the growth rate there is very consistent with the last few quarters.
The growth rate in the GNS cards at 7% is somewhat lower than what we’ve seen over the last several quarters.
It had been kind of in the low-single digits right.
So the lower growth rate is driven by fewer GNS cards in out there.
So the growth in our business is going to come as I said before from both higher average spend as well as higher number of cards and the fact that cards are growing at 2% and 3% compared to maybe proprietary cards compared to higher levels historically is due to the change in strategy more focused on the premium cards as opposed to just being cards in.
In terms of new cards in China part of what drove the strong performance in GNS and in JAPA the answer to that is yes right.
So both in China and Korea we’ve had some new partners signed and some new product launches in those countries both by new partners and existing partners.
So that is part of what’s driving the GNS and JAPA growth rates that we see.
LLP</strong> Hi.
And just as a follow-up housekeeping.
So Bluebird is not included in that cards in force type of zone imagine that’s a pretty big number but… It’s not included in cards in force no.
LLP</strong> Okay okay.
And at some point will you start to decompose the cards in force at that level? Thank you.
So I mean currently we share information in terms of what the GNS piece is.
I think we can do some geographic splits for you.
So I think that I don’t know that we are going to give more detail on that it wasn’t in our thinking but certainly as we move forward we’ll provide information as it relates to new products like Bluebird but we think it’s appropriate.
Okay.
Thank you.
And the next question is from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.
Please go ahead.
Inc.</strong> Yeah thanks.
Dan just help me if you could provide a little more color on what we can expect on the GNS growth in Asia you referenced.
Is it realistic to think that at least for the next three quarters you’ve got some fairly positive year-over-year comps on that should we continue to expect to see that kind of robust mid-high teens billed business growth from Asia? So I don’t want to forecast.
In China it is an important market for us and we’re focused on the partners that we have and the [biologics] that will take place.
So my sense is that will be a good growth market but I don’t want to forecast exactly where our GNS growth is going to be over the next couple of quarters.
And also potentially it will be impacted by the economy in China.
But right now our growth rates are being driven there by new partner signings and new product launches.
Inc.</strong> Okay got it.
And then just a follow-up with marketing and promotion expense kind of leveling off on a year-over-year basis is it reasonable to expect or continue to see kind of the 4% to 5% cards in force growth that you had over the last year or so? Well we have come up with this 9% number out there.
And I don’t want it be a target or a guideline but I think it’s recognition of the fact that on an annual basis right we have fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter.
On an annual basis we need to increase investments at the rate they were growing the business if we’re going to continue to have the type of business momentum that we want.
So my view is we are very committed to investing in the growth of business.
You have seen us do that historically and we will continue to do that.
So our view is we want to make sure that there are sufficient investment dollars to sustain the business momentum as we go forward.
Certainly the whole focus on reengineering that we announced in January is designed to grow operating expense at a slower rate so that it provides additional resources for investment in the growth of the business.
Inc.</strong> Got it.
Thanks best of luck to you Dan.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Next question is from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel.
Please go ahead.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</strong> Hi thanks good afternoon.
A quick follow-up on the cards in force it’s my understanding that you had some minor annual fee increases in some of your proprietary products this year and some – did you see that in the net cards in force is there any pricing activity across your portfolio I guess any (inaudible) but it’s significant is that a contributing factor and is that something you continue to squeeze higher over the years given the strength of your products and the consumers attraction and loyalty to your products? As we said there were selected price increases on certain products.
We never tried to squeeze out higher fees we don’t want to increase fees without improving the value proposition for customers so our practice has been where we increase fees to also avail that increase the value propositions to our customers and we have been very successful at that and when we have had fee increases we have not seen a notable attrition as a result of that.
So it’s all tied into – we’re delivering value we’ve increased the value part of the increase in the fee and probably of course it goes into the bottom line what portions goes back into increasing the value to the cardmember.
That has been our strategy and I think it will be our strategy going forward.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</strong> Okay great and then my follow-up question enterprise growth and your initiatives there the $3 billion target I guess and possible with your Bloomberg update for the community meeting in early August so ultimately feel an update there I am just curious as to the investments you made over the past several years serving particular are we starting to see any meaningful contributions from those new initiatives yet? Any color there would be helpful.
Yeah so we set a $3 billion target couple of years ago to exit 2014 at that rate.
Simply when we set that target we didn’t necessarily contemplate the economy being as slow as it has been over that period that number as we’ve disclosed last year was $1.5 billion.
So we have a lot of work to do between now and then but we continue to think that it’s an appropriate target for us to inform.
I don’t anticipate us updating that until we update what I just gave now.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</strong> And what about the Serve? So I think one of topics at the meeting will be Dan Schulman and he will talk about what’s taking place both in Serve as well as Bloomberg in particular.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</strong> Excellent.
Congratulations Dan.
Thanks a lot.
Okay so we’ll just take one more question.
Okay and our final question then comes from the line of Brad Ball of Evercore.
Please go ahead.
Thanks and congratulations Dan and good luck in your future endeavors.
Thank you.
I wonder if you can give us a sense for the progression of billings over the course of the quarter month to months was it stronger late in the quarter and would you give us an update for July to-date? So the earnings growth over the month-by-month was relatively consistent.
There is no sharp upward trend or downward trend.
I would say it’s relatively consistent.
And we don’t really plan to give an update about what has taken place in July.
When you tend to give even a quarter is a short period of time you try to do it for a couple of weeks.
We’ve found the side note necessarily indicative of what’s going to happen to the quarter.
But within the quarter month-by-month it was relatively consistent.
Okay fair enough.
And then one follow-up on the EC proposal you said in your press release earlier today that separating the payment network and processing functions did not appear to impact proprietary networks like AMX’s.
Could you explain what you mean by that and what’s the basis for making that statement? So I am not going to say I am an expert here.
But I think there is some language in there about what you need to split the merchant core processor and the merchant acquirer I guess in the network.
In that case in our case we do all those functions so it doesn’t appear to us that that was the applicable in our situation.
But again once you get a chance to read the draft we can address that more specifically.
So it would apply to a four party system but not to the three party system is that… That’s our understanding.
Okay.
That’s helpful.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
Thanks everybody for joining the call and thank you very much for your congratulations.
From my perspective it has been a pleasure dealing with each of you as well and we are highly confident that Jeff will do a terrific job as we go forward.
So thanks very much.
Okay thank you.
And ladies and gentlemen this conference will be made available for replay after 7 PM this evening through July 24 at midnight.

Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time.
(Operator Instructions) As a reminder today’s conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you.
Welcome.
We appreciate all of you joining us for today’s call.
The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company’s 2012 10-K already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2013 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed.
All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter’s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Once Jeff completes his remarks we will move to a Q&amp;A session.
With that let me turn it over to Jeff.
Well thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone.
I am excited to be here on my first quarterly earnings call with American Express since joining the company on July 15 and listening as Dan Henry managed the Q2 earnings call later that week.
I am also excited to have my first earnings call be one where we have such solid results to discuss.
Our performance during the quarter produced strong EPS growth built upon improved billed business and revenue growth trends a continuation of excellent credit performance and disciplined control over operating expenses.
During the quarter we also made a number of strategic announcements which I’ll discuss later on the call.
To begin with the summary you can see on slide 2 FX adjusted growth in billed business of 9% is the primary driver of our FX adjusted revenue growth rate of 7%.
This FX adjusted revenue growth rate is the highest we have seen this year and helped us grow net income by 9%.
Our strong capital position allowed us to continue our share repurchase efforts which cumulatively resulted in our average shares outstanding declining by 5% versus the prior year.
The combination of our solid operating performance and strong capital position drove our earnings per share to a $1.25 which was up 15% versus the prior year.
These results helped to bring our ROE for the period ending September 30 to 24%.
As a reminder ROE is calculated on a rolling full year basis.
So this quarter will be the last one to include the impact of the three previously announced items we experienced in Q4 2012.
Excluding these items the adjusted ROE for Q3 ’13 is 27%.
We feel good about this improved performance especially considering the continued moderate pace of the economic recovery.
Now focusing first on our billed business loan and revenue performance.
You can see on slide 3 that billed business growth remained healthy across all of our segments as it increased sequentially from 8% to 9% overall on an FX adjusted basis we continue to see particularly strong performance in GNS which grew by 16% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis.
GNS volume growth in Asia including China and Japan remained particularly strong.
Also worth noting was that corporate card billings growth improved to 7% on an FX adjusted basis from 5% in Q2 as we lapped the slowdown in corporate spending that we saw beginning with the second half of 2012.
Looking at billed business growth by geographical region on slide 4 you see the growth rates accelerated slightly across all regions sequentially versus the second quarter.
Of particular note here is that EMEA FX adjusted growth improved to 8% during Q3 which is the highest growth we have seen in that region since 2011.
Turning to loans we continue to see modest growth in loan balances as shown on slide 5.
Worldwide loans grew by 2% versus the prior year.
Our growth rate in loans in the U.S.
was 3% which continues to outpace the industry average.
Now I would remind you that our loan growth is really an outcome of our continued focus on and growth in our spend-centric customer base and it's not necessarily an objective in itself.
Putting it all together on the revenue side you see on slide 6 that overall revenue growth was 6% on a reported basis and on an FX adjusted basis accelerated from 4% in Q2 to 7% in Q3.
Consistent with our spend-centric model this revenue growth was driven primarily by higher discount revenue from increased spending volumes.
Secondarily revenue growth was aided by net interest income increasing by 9% versus the prior year as we experienced lower funding costs along with the increase in average loan balances.
Probably also worth calling out that the 5% increase in travel commissions in fees growth looks like a significant uptick from Q2 where we saw a 5% decline.
Both of these year-over-year changes however where impacted by the timing around the re-signing of certain supplier contracts.
Turning to the provision overall our credit performance remains excellent and helped provide us the financial resources we need to continue to grow the business.
Looking at the metrics highlighted on slide 7 you see that worldwide lending write-off rates which were already at historically low levels declined further during the third quarter and also remained best-in-class.
Our strategy to focus our lending acquisition efforts on premium lending products continues to help attract lower risk card members into our franchise.
While we would expect that lending write-off rates will eventually increase from today’s historically low levels we will also see on Slide 7 that we have not yet seen any signs of credit deterioration overall as total delinquency rates remained consistent with the prior quarter.
Slide 8 shows that our lending reserve coverage levels also remained relatively consistent with the prior quarter.
We believe that our coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Finally as you can see on Slide 9 despite the improvement in write-off rates our provision was slightly higher than prior year as decreased write-offs in the current year were more than offset by higher volumes and a lower level of reserve releases.
Turning now from the revenue side to the expense side as you can see on Slide 10 total expenses grew by 5% versus the prior year.
As you would expect growth rates differed across the various expense lines as we prioritized our spending across the business.
At a high level you see a few things in these lines.
The year-over-year growth in rewards expense was relatively consistent with our billed business growth during the quarter while card member services was relatively flat.
We continue to show good control over operating expense which I will come back to in a minute.
All of this is aimed at providing the ability to invest in growth which primarily though not completely flows through the marketing and promotion line while still seeking to achieve our financial targets.
And as I mentioned we do remain very focused on controlling operating expenses to make our business more efficient and provide additional resources for growth initiatives.
Slide 11 shows you some of the detail of our operating expenses for the quarter.
Most importantly from a recurring perspective salaries and employee benefits expenses were up only 2% versus the prior year demonstrating our strong controls in this area.
While total operating expense growth of 4% was higher than what we have seen earlier this year this was due in part to some choices we made to increase investments in technology as well as some costs we incurred associated with the two transactions we announced during the quarter the potential Business Travel joint venture and the sale of our Publishing business.
So while growth rates can fluctuate in any given quarter our year-to-date operating expense performance is flat versus the prior year and remains well below our annual target as shown on Slide 12.
We remain confident in our ability to have operating expenses grow by less than our 3% target for the full year.
It is also important to point out that these results reflected many of the benefits of the reengineering actions we announced earlier this year which has helped us continue to proactively adapt and strengthen every aspect of our business as well as allowing us to address changes in customer preferences towards online and mobile servicing in particular.
In my first month at American Express I would further say that one of the things that I have been particularly impressed with is the company’s ability to achieve our reengineering and cost targets while not just maintaining but actually improving the level of service provided to our customers.
In addition we have been able to achieve these results while funding growing investments in our critical control and compliance efforts.
As a result of all these improvements customer service remains a key competitive differentiator for American Express as evidenced by the announcement last month from our winning our seventh consecutive J.D.
Power award for achieving the highest customer satisfaction in the U.S.
credit card industry.
So to come back to the prioritization we do across all our expenses during the third quarter we were able to deliver excellent financial results while still funding substantial investment opportunities.
As we think about these investment opportunities we balance our mix of spend between shorter and longer term horizons as well as between traditional versus newer opportunities.
As you would expect the largest portion of our investment dollars targets the significant opportunities we see in our existing card businesses.
In the U.S.
as well as around the world given our focus on international growth for the past several years.
These initiatives include card and merchant acquisition building loyalty with the existing card members and the expansion of our GNS business.
Many of these initiatives were the drivers of our marketing and promotion expense growing by 8% versus the prior year which put us at a higher level than we have seen in recent quarters as you can see on slide 13.
We continue to see many attractive opportunities in the marketplace including those for new customer acquisitions.
In particular we believe that there continue to be significant opportunities to grow our volumes around the world by acquiring new charge and premium lending prospects on our products.
Our solid control over operating expenses is helping us to fund these efforts.
But I also want to remind you that while a significant amount of our investments are still included within the marketing and promotion line overtime an increasing percentage of our key investments are occurring within operating expenses including expansion of our merchant and corporate sales force technology development and enhancements to our control and compliance activities.
It's also worth noting that we continue to invest in and see great progress in expanding our network business around the world.
Our new partnership with Wells Fargo which we announced in August clearly illustrates the value that other see in our global network as well as the potential opportunities we have to grow the network business both internationally and in the U.S.
As I said earlier we also target a portion of our investments for longer term opportunities including many initiatives in the digital space that we believe are attractive opportunities but that will take longer to pay back.
Two of our larger efforts in this area are around reloadable prepaid our products that help you move and manage your money which we extensively discussed at our recent financial community meeting as well as our loyalty partner rewards coalition program.
On the former we were pleased last week to announce the relaunch of the certain product.
And on the latter we continue to see the number of customers in our loyalty partner rewards coalition programs growing nicely.
Both of these efforts along with our many other digital initiatives we believe provide potential new opportunities for growth over the longer term.
So turning now to capital our strong capital position and the sizeable amount of new capital we generate through net income each quarter provide significant flexibility.
This allows us to balance the capital needs in our businesses our desire to maintain strong capital ratios and the potential for significant capital returns to our shareholders.
The benefits of our strong capital position were on display this quarter as we returned 86% capital generated to shareholders while still maintaining the capital ratios you can see on slide 14.
We’re of course working hard on the planning for our 2014 CCAR submission and are continuously improving and evolving our process.
We remain committed to maintaining our strong capital position while also leveraging that strength to create value for our shareholders part of our commitment to maintain strong capital position has been working to evolve the mix of our funding sources which you can see on slide 15.
We have worked hard to improve the diversity of our funding sources by driving a significant increase and the contribution from deposits.
We have seen excellent traction in the growth of our personal savings direct deposit program and deposits now makeup over 40% of our total funding.
Overall our liquidity position remained strong and we continue to hold enough cash to cover our next 12 months of funding maturities.
Given today’s political climate as I will come back to it at the end.
It's probably also worth noting that the majority of our cash is held on deposit with the Fed and our direct holdings of treasuries constitutes less than 1% of our liquid assets.
Turning to other events of the last quarter let me make just a few comments on the two other announcements we made.
First in September we announced plans to create a joint venture designed to accelerate the transformation of our Global Business Travel division.
American Express has a long history in business travel.
And we believe this proposed joint venture would create greater investment capacity for the business allowing it to further enhance its suite of products and services attract new customers and grow internationally to deliver additional value to customers.
This should all serve to strengthen the linkages with our corporate card and other businesses.
We will plan to update you with more information about the proposed transaction and its financial impact as we progress towards a potential closing date which we currently estimate will be Q2 2014.
On a much smaller scale we also announced in September the sale of our Publishing business to Time Inc.
and this transaction closed in early October.
Publishing constitute a relatively small percentage of our revenues and earnings during the past several years.
It did however provide a valued benefit to our customers card members.
So while banking regulations will limit our ability to engage in non-financial activities our operating agreement with Time will help ensure a seamless transition.
From a financial perspective the Publishing business will no longer be reflective in our financial statements beginning in Q4.
Before I conclude I feel it’s only prudent to add a few comments regarding the government shutdown and debt ceiling as we all watch by the hour what is happening in DC.
We have not yet seen any direct impact on our business here at American Express but we are not immune from the broader economies in which we operate no one is.
Now as we started this call it looks like our leaders in DC are finally coming to an agreement in both the Senate and the House.
Resolving the stalemate is critically important.
The alternative is now come that would erode consumer confidence and jeopardize a still uncertain economic recovery.
So in summary coming back to our results we feel very good about our overall performance in the current economic environment.
During the quarter we saw modest improvements in billings growth across all regions.
We also saw improved revenue growth which then combined with best-in-class credit metrics discipline on controlling operating expenses and a strong capital position to generate healthy earnings growth.
Our financial strength allowed us to achieve this growth while still investing in the growth opportunities we currently see in the marketplace.
Looking forward we continued to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders.
With that I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate.
Operator?   (Operator Instructions) We’ll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I had a quick question on billed business volumes.
When we look at the acceleration even on FX adjusted basis it’s fairly modest year-over-year.
Could you just talk about how you guys feel about that and what might be some of the constraining factors that are leading to some temporary growth year-over-year? And then secondly just on prepaid I know you guys talked a lot about it this quarter I was just wondering if you could just discuss its contribution to profitability and how you guys think about its contribution maybe over time? Thank you.
Great.
Well I would say given the continued moderate pace of economic recovery both in the U.S.
and the other – most of the other significant economies we serve around the globe we actually feel pretty good about the sequential acceleration we saw from 8% to 9% in FX adjusted billing growth.
And I think we would really not necessarily expect to see dramatic uptick until we saw something different happening in the economy that also brings it back I think to the importance of nothing happening in DC tonight or tomorrow that further disrupts the pace of economic recovery in the U.S.
and elsewhere.
On the prepaid point we did spend quite a bit of time at the August financial community meeting having Dan talk about our enterprise growth efforts and in particular about our efforts in the reloadable prepaid market.
You also heard me in my comments talk a little bit about how we tried to as we think about where we are investing we like to create a mix of investments some of which are targeted at producing short-term results to help us achieve our financial targets next year and some of which have much longer term time horizons and certainly we would put what we’re trying to achieve in the reloadable prepaid market in the latter category.
We’re very excited about that market and we see a very significant market potential in the longer term as I think Dan did a very nice job of taking people through in August and also Jim has showed you a number of metrics at that meeting that we think are very early very positive indicators about the potential that we see in the market longer-term but it is a longer-term prospect and certainly in the near term the revenue and earnings contributions from the prepaid market will be fairly modest but we think it's really important part of the broader investment portfolio and we think it's really important part of what a company of our size and scale that manages itself for the long term needs to do and that is having a mixture of both initiatives targeted at short-term growth as well as those targeted at the long-term.
Thank you and next we will go to the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup.
Please go ahead.
Jeff I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about historically I think one of the concerns that AMEX has been when the top line starts to accelerate that there is a propensity to boost expenses and I was just curious you know you think there is a strong commitment still to keeping expenses under control as we look like we’re turning the corner on top line growth?  Well I think that's a very good question Don and as I said in my comments one of the things I have been most impressed by in my first three months here is the commitment of the company and the extent of the reengineering efforts going on across this entire company all aimed at hitting the expense targets that we set for this year and for next and in fact we have done much better than we set out to do in 2013 we’re flat year-to-date and we’re certainly very confident that we will come in for the full year below our target of 3% operating expense growth.
When we launched those initiatives we did talk about 2014 as well and it's certainly too early to give you a forecast for 2014 but what I would tell you is that many of the initiatives many of the things that we’re doing in the reengineering area are only in midflight and there are many aspects of the program that we’ll still continue to play out next year.
And so I certainly feel very comfortable saying it's an appropriate target for us in 2014 to continue to see the kind of great control on operating expenses that you see in 2013.
Now I would say as you go beyond 2014 we’re very committed to our financial targets and we've have had the same long-term financial targets since 1993 but we're also very committed to managing the company for the long term and to using our financial strength to continually invest in growth opportunities both in our traditional businesses and some of the things that we think are a little longer-term as Sanjay just asked about in the prior question.
So some of those investments at times are going to drive operating expense in the longer-term so as the near-term benefits of the reengineering start to become more distant as we move beyond 2014 I think we will be thoughtful about how we manage expenses across the company but our larger goal will be to continue to achieve the kind of growth we have over a much longer time period historically that is consistent with our long-term financial targets.
We will go next to the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.
Please go ahead.
Yes hi.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Regarding marketing 9% of total revenue was that still – is that still an appropriate target for the year? And to follow up on other revenue excluding ICBC gains which I believe were in the numbers last year that line was up nearly 10%.
Is the growth there being driven by loyalty partner above everything else? Thanks.
Well let me take those one at a time.
On the marketing I think as I have on the history Craig at one point we said if you take a historical average view our marketing and promotional expenses have on average been about 9% of revenue through different parts of the cycle.
Certainly if you just even look at the slide that’s in the deck today you see that there is quite a bit of quarterly volatility to that number.
And I think the more important way to think about the target is we are very committed to achieving the financial goals we have around earnings growth in particular.
And we see the marketing and promotional line as one of the most important levers we have to help us achieve those targets while still funding a significant number of growth initiatives to allow us to continue to grow into the future.
So at times that’s going to drive us above 9%.
If you look at this quarter we actually are at about 10% of revenue this quarter in terms of marketing and promotion.
So I guess that historical average is an okay reasonable guideline but our real goal is to continue to drive towards the long-term financial targets on the bottom line.
In terms of other revenue I would tell you the ICBC gains were fairly similar both last year and this year in the results.
And I don’t know if there is any other particular drivers in that other revenue line as you would imagine there is a number of things that make that lineup and that can produce a little bit of quarterly volatility but there is nothing reflective of any longer term trend.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We will go next to the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Good evening.
Just a follow-up on with your comments pertaining to the government shutdown I guess first can you give us a sense of how spend volumes progressed during the quarter and while you haven’t seen a direct impact did you see corporate spend slowing as the shutdown approached?  Well couple of comments Ryan.
One thing even in three months here I have learned to be a little cautious about is attaching too much significance to daily or weekly trends because they are volatile.
With that caveat what I would tell you is that we are certainly pleased with the modest sequential improvement in our billed business - it went from 8% to 9% on an FX adjusted basis and really if I take the time period from the beginning of the quarter on July 1 really to the most recent days there is no particular trends within that period between the beginning of the quarter and a couple of days ago that show any meaningful variance from that overall sequential trend.
So there is just nothing in our data that would support any particular impact amongst our customer base in what they spend money on from the economic turmoil but boy I don’t want to in anyway draw a conclusion that the uncertainty being created in DC if it continues isn’t eventually going to cause a real challenge economically for us and for many people.
Got it.
And then just on an unrelated note on the NII growth you noted that loan balances were up 2% I think you said NII growth was up 9% and I know some of that’s coming from lower funding costs but it seems like a lot of that is actually coming from the yield side any – is there anything seasonal component to that or is there any changes in the underlying portfolio dynamics that drove such a large year-over-year increase?  Well the short answer is no.
So it’s really as simple as the loan balance being up a little bit and the funding costs are really the larger driver not so much the yield we are getting on loans but our funding costs are down nicely year-over-year and that’s what drove the 9%.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Thank you.
We will go next to line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Hi just a follow-up on the last question so what is the opportunity for continuing to reduce funding cost going forward deposit pricing or makeshift?  Well excellent question so you're correct in terms of the underlying premise of the question which is if you think about the past year you have both frankly a little bit rate environment based on the part of the interest rate curve that drives our funding along with the steady improvement in the mix in particular the larger mix that power the larger portion the deposits or the mix.
I would say that we have multiple goals when we think about our overall funding and while minimizing the cost is one of those goals so is having a diverse group or diverse set of sources of funds so it's regularly accessing the various markets from which we get funds so that we maintain a good visibility in the marketplace and so is thinking about the structure of the company both at the parent level as well as the two U.S.
banks that are part of American Express and so when you put all of those things together I would say that the steady growth in deposits that you've seen over the last couple of years is probably at least in the near term and a bit of a standstill and so where we’re today we're pretty comfortable and we probably won't be driving that much increase in deposits going forward.
So that really leaves our funding costs a function of where interest rates goes if you think about the near-term.
Okay and then the flip side of them obviously is the yields can you give us some color on how you’re thinking about positioning AMEX as a competitor in the marketplace it feels like there's been at the margin more competitive actions taking place on yield trying to attract incremental balances how do you guys think about that?  Well of course there are many different answers to that which market but the U.S.
market is certainly the most important market for us financially and to touch on that one a little bit I guess you know our goal is to continue to use a variety of products and initiatives all targeted at trying to grow the franchise with the demographics if you like which are the more affluent spend centric consumers that value the brand and service and that really is our goal as we think about the design of products as we think about competitive responses.
And we use lots of different attributes of our products and lots of different marketing approaches to try to get at that demographic but trying to out compete people on just offering lower yields or rates does not really rate very highly on our list.
And while the competitive environment is certainly a challenging one it's always challenging.
You know we feel pretty good about our retention of customers one of the things we talked about if you go back to the August Financial Community Meeting was the fact that if you look at our attrition rates so these are customers or card members in the U.S.
who leave us voluntarily.
Those attrition rates have steadily declined over the last five years and continue to steadily decline and so when we look at that statistic it makes us feel pretty good about the fact that we remain very competitive in the marketplace and our card members are not being lured away by our competitors in various offers that they have in the marketplace.
Thank you will go next to the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead.
Couple of questions about marketing Jeff could you just talk about whether you think just near term are your marketing efforts kind of accelerating or decelerating going as we go into the fourth quarter into 2014?  Well I suppose it's a broad it's hard to broadly generalize about our marketing efforts because of course we do lots of things and lots of different areas that said with the caveat if you just look at the marketing and promotion expense slide in our slides today you will see that into third quarter we had the highest spend we have had in quite a number of quarters but I would say there is really a couple of factors that drive that.
One is what we are really focused on is trying to balance our near-term financial performance with the many strong investment and growth opportunities that we see across this company.
I would tell you one of the things that perhaps has been one of the more positive surprises as I joined the company – as I joined the company because I saw lots of great growth opportunities in lots of ways for a company to create value for its shareholders in the coming years.
I would say since I got here I have been even more surprised at the breadth and depth of the opportunities we have which are very financially sound financially positive to grow our franchise.
And in fact our challenge in many ways Moshe is to think about how we balance all of those opportunities with the fact that we also need to continue to achieve the steady strong financial performance that we are known for.
So in many ways we never have a shortage of financially sound profitable marketing initiatives to pursue.
We have to be thoughtful and prioritize which ones we can afford given our financial targets.
What that means is when we are having a financially strong quarter when we did this quarter it allow us to invest a little bit more in the future.
And that’s really what you see I think as you look at that marketing and promotions line.
Got you.
There is a follow-up.
Can you talk about your approach towards the credit card enhancement products? I mean have you started to remarket those and what’s best to take after what went on with the CFPB?  Well obviously another thing I have come to appreciate since I joined the company is the full complexity of the regulatory environment.
And we remain incredibly committed as a company to continuing to improve all of our control and compliance efforts and to ensure that our customers always know exactly what they are getting and we deliver exactly what we told them we were going to deliver.
And we think we have made significant improvements and we think we still have further to go in many areas.
That certainly has had some impact on the full range of products that we offer.
And those impacts will probably lessen over time as we continue to strengthen our control and compliance efforts but we want to be a little bit cautious to make sure that we pace all of our efforts in a way that allows us to be very consistent with what the regulators would like us to do and very consistent what is really in the best interest of our customers and that does mean going a little slower times.
Over time we are quite confident we will be back being as nimble as we have ever been.
Thanks so much.
Thank you.
And next we will go to the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.
Yes thanks for taking my call.
I am wondering if you could expand on what you said about the billed business trends over the course of the quarter I think you said there was no meaningful variance but I wonder how that relates to the change in loan growth from month-to-month because it seems through the first two months of this quarter your loans were growing faster than the industry and it’s kind of consistent with high rate of spending growth but then in September there seemed to be a reversal of that trend? And I had follow-up.
Well I will say David well when we look at that data we don’t see a lot other than what maybe noise and not necessarily yet indicative of any trends.
And certainly we would believe that we are still outpacing the overall industry with our loan growth.
There are also at times there are seasonal fluctuations I don’t know if there is fluctuations around when holidays occur around Labor Day and when schools start and back-to-school spending all those kinds of things can influence just a little bit.
So as we stare at the data we really have not drawn any conclusions from that month-to-month volatility.
So we could expect some increase as we head into the fourth quarter again do you think?  Well that’s…  With that forecast.
I would see with what tonight brings in D.C.
and what the fourth quarter overall brings.
Okay.
And then I am sorry if I missed it but did you say what the gain would be from Publishing from the sale and what the impact on income would be going forward?  So the financial results of the sale of publishing are actually in the third quarter results because while the transaction closed right at the beginning of October because most of the impacts of the sale broadly speaking were known and correct accounting was to go ahead and approve them in the results that we just published today.
Now I would point out to you that this was a sale driven by the reality of banking regulations and in fact in the quarter the net of all the costs associated with the sale and the sale itself is very modest loss or very modest negative for the company.
I was wondering could you tell us how modest the losses in the negative?  No but it was more than modest I would have bothered to call it out I guess part of what you see when you look at some of that professional fee line in the slide and you have a big professional fees there is some cost associated with the sale as well as the business travel transaction and some other items but it was a loss.
Okay and then going forward should there be any noticeable impact on other income?  So there will be a modest impact on revenues and it was a profitable business for us and as we go forward into Q4 we will help make sure we call out to people what the impact year-over-year was so we don't distort any of the trends but it was a very important business to our card members and customers.
It is a great management team and a great business and we’re sorry to see it go but it will not be a meaningful financial event.
Right -- I know I used up my call but if you just clarify what you said about professional services that's crept up a lot over the last year? How much of that is control and compliance spending and how much is kind of one-time items like the sales and the joint ventures and other investments do you think?  Well there is a couple of things remember the way we run our technology today a tremendous amount percentage of our development efforts on technology are actually outsourced and run through that professional services lines and so as I mentioned earlier in my remarks it's also true that increasingly many of our growth initiatives are technology oriented which drives more technology application development expense.
So that is certainly one and probably the largest significant contributor to the growth in that line.
Now you’re correct though that as have all large financial institutions we have significantly increased our spending in the area of control and compliance and there is a significant portion of that spent that also runs through the professional fees line and in addition to rank through the salaries and benefits line.
So that is a second component that is not one-time in nature and it will be ongoing and is a very important and will continue to do it.
I would say when you look at this quarter's results which have that line of 15% that is not run rate we would expect to be a normal run rate and there were some one-time anomalies including the costs related to the business travel transaction and the publishing sale amongst few others that created a little bit of spike this quarter.
Thank you and we will go next to the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities.
Please go ahead.
You’re supplement says that the URR was unchanged this quarter versus last at 98% can you give us a sense for how it's been trending over the last few quarters if you were to go out an extra decimal point?  Well you give me a heart attack there for a second Bill because if it was 98% we would-  Sorry I meant 94%.
Hopefully it says the supplement says 94% which is a good number and that number varies a little bit by a basis point to each quarter because of course there is a very complex set of calculations based on the behavior patterns that we see across tens and millions of members but unbalanced since we last made a methodology update which would have been in Q4 of 2012 the number has been reasonably flat at 94%.
Okay.
And switching gears as a follow-up on credit we have seen peak losses evolve quite a bit post the crisis do you think that there is still room for peak losses on the loans that you are originating today to continue to move lower based on the credit quality at which you are underwriting loans currently?  Boy we are at such a historical low.
And as I have learned in the history I think we have had quite a number or strain of calls like this where you said we are at the historical low it’s great but eventually things have to go up and then we have another quarter as we do this time where they have gone down.
I would be hesitant to speculate but Rick you may want to add some comments if you like a more history.
Yes I think what you said is exactly what we said a couple of times probably not just as for the number of players in the industry.
We continue to see good trends in delinquency.
So it’s hard to see any deterioration there but we continue to enjoy where we are now and haven’t really put in place goals to change the risk profile of the company at this point.
Okay thanks very much.
Thank you.
We will go next to the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital.
Please go ahead.
Great.
Thank you for taking my questions.
I just had a couple.
Number one just touching on the expenses again we are hearing over the last couple of quarters that the American Express has been investing quite a bit on – in big data projects large data analytics projects and the like and if that’s true then where are lot of those expenses are those in part of marketing because they are analytical in nature or in professional services? And should we expect the high level of expenses that continue or would the mix shift more to traditional what we think of is traditional marketing? And the other unrelated question was in terms of the expected or proposed sale of the Business Travel business and the cash of $700 million to $1 billion it seems like that business was not generating a lot of bottom line profit.
So it seems like the bottom line impact should be relatively modest and I say relative compared to the $700 million to $1 billion in cash that you expect to receive.
So when you give the cash do you expect that to be additive to your current run rate for buybacks and dividends or how should we think about that? Thank you.
Well let me take those one at a time.
So as I said a few minutes ago our strategy historically in our technology development area has been to outsource a lot of that work and therefore the costs run through the professional services line.
And certainly you have heard us talk a lot about some of the really interesting things we are doing around big data and a portion of that involves some very complex IT work and that is some of what is driving up our technology costs in a very positive way right.
I mean these are – we would love these into the kinds of growth oriented initiatives than spending that we are really pleased.
We have the financial strength to do and still hit our financial targets but that does run through the professional fees line.
It’s part of what’s driving it up.
I do want to keep coming back to a 15% year-over-year increase is not what we would expect as an ongoing run rate but that is part of what’s going on this quarter.
To go to the Business Travel transaction let me just step back for a second.
So this is what we are creating here will be a 50:50 joint venture.
And we are very excited about this transaction because we think the influx of the capital from the other partners will really help the joint venture to do a better job.
And frankly it’s been able to do for the last few years at growth and investing in technology because to some of the points I made earlier we have so many great investment alternatives here at American Express that it had at times been difficult for travel to compete for our investment dollars.
So because if there is a joint venture that’s $700 million to $1 billion goes into the joint venture it does not go into the coffers of American Express and the full expectation is that that joint venture will use that capital over time to grow and expand as a business and we will benefit from that growth and expansion as a 50% owner of the joint venture.
Along those lines so if you think about the creation of the joint venture we are contributing the business and a partner is contributing that portion of the capital that will drive some gain which we haven't have yet to quantify until we get closer because the valuation on the joint venture will be based on the capital they are putting in for 50% and that will certainly exceed our current basis.
On a go forward basis the joint venture we will account for on an equity method so you won't see the revenues and expenses of the joint venture what you will see will be the earnings and then the last point I would make is you’re correct that the historical contributions of our business travel business to profits have been fairly modest and volatile in times.
It's been a very important and will remain a very important strategic part of the company.
Certainly part of the logic and appeal of creating this joint venture is we expect with the resources that the joint venture will have and with the focus that it will have it will become a very profitable and high-growth enterprise and will be pleased to have 50% of it.
Thank you.
We will go next to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.
In the press release Ken just mentions that the strength and earnings that you have had this year is going to give you the flexibility to make substantial investments in the fourth quarter.
I know there has been a lot of talk around expenses and many times you've reiterated the importance of the growth targets but I'm just wondering if you could with that kind of a call out in the press release what you were thinking I mean the earnings in 2012 were 440 if you look at your 12% to 15% are you looking at it that way in some regards and the minimum of 12% of earnings growth this year and maybe just quantify a little bit or give us a little more color on that call out in the press release.
Well I think Bob we’re always balancing making sure we achieve the financial targets that we’re known for achieving on a consistent basis with investing to sustain the future and long-term growth of the company.
And you saw this quarter our financial strength allowed us to get to a 15% EPS growth number year over year while spending more in the marketing and promotions areas than we spent in many quarters and while also doing some of the things like some of the technology spending we talked over the last couple of questioners which is also very growth oriented and so when you look at what Ken said in the press release today he talks about the flexibility that our financial strength gives us flexibility that gave us to make substantial investment this quarter in marketing and other initiatives.
The fourth quarter is another quarter and if you’ve seen one quarter you’ve seen one quarter and we'll as we always do as we get into the fourth quarter make sure we balance what we need to do to achieve our financial targets with what we need to do in the short term with what we need to do to achieve our 2014 but I don't think we intended to make any particular call out on our actions that we would be taking in the fourth quarter in the press release.
Okay follow up on the prepaid on the relaunch prepaid and trying to understand a little bit more time you’re expanding the distribution you call out certain retailers and American Express has had a prepaid card on the [indiscernible] several of those retailers is the difference that you're rolling out you’re going to be getting more space in those new retailers and they will be offering a Bluebird like card but not under the Bluebird name?  Well I would say it's a good question and when you look at a new launch or the relaunch of serve [ph] it involves a range of new product features that makes it a much more comprehensive tool for managing all of your financial affairs.
As part of those broader capabilities we’re including a number of new partners and retailers that will help people with a card do cash load and in particular we called out CVS and 7/11.
So the combination of the broader more complete array of features based on what we've learned from Bluebird and other efforts that customers really value and want in these products along with the broader distribution network we think makes this a very attractive product and we are very excited about the re-launch.
Great thank you.
So operator I think we have time for one last question.
Great.
That will come from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.
Thank you.
First question is on GNS how long can that segment continue to grow at the double-digit plus rate on billed businesses? And is any Wells Fargo business in that yet and how big can the Wells Fargo business get for you?   Well a couple of questions.
Our GNS business as you really pointed out is both active in the U.S.
marketplace as well as internationally.
And I might almost take your questions in turn certainly or split it into two parts.
In the U.S.
we are very excited about the Wells Fargo partnership.
You wouldn’t have seen any results from the Wells Fargo partnership in the third quarter results.
They are going to begin to do a few pilots in the fourth quarter and the larger rollouts will occur in 2014 but as you know Wells is very focused on growing its credit card business.
They have a tremendous customer base.
They are very excited I think about what we are bringing to the partnership and we are very excited about their focus on trying to build broader royalty across their current customer base.
We think that’s the model that can be replicated in many other places in the U.S.
and we are hopeful that over time you will see more announcements in that arena.
When you go outside the U.S.
in the GNS business I guess I would point out the obvious which is our – we are still a modestly sized player in many markets around the globe particularly relative to the too dominant networks.
We see tremendous opportunity to continue to grow at the kind of reach you have seen for a very long time because if you just do the math we could grow at these rates for very long time and still be the scrappy third competitor trying to bring innovation to the markets and focus on strong customer service and focus on delivering real value to the merchants we have to negotiate with every day.
So this is a business that we launched in the late 90s 1999 I believe.
It’s interesting as a newcomer to look at the historical charts on this business because it took a while to begin to get contraction perhaps like some of our early efforts today may take a while to get traction but we believe it has tremendous momentum right now and we are very very excited about the business.
So on that note I would like to thank everyone for your time and say I am very excited and pleased to be here at American Express.
I think we had a tremendous quarter and I look forward to doing many other calls.
With that I am going to turn it back to the operator.
Thank you.

I’d now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead.
Thanks and welcome.
We appreciate everyone joining us for today’s call.
The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company’s other reports already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2013 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed.
All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some key points related to the quarter’s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed.
Once Jeff completes his remarks we will move to a Q&amp;A session.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.
Well thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone.
I am pleased to be here this afternoon to discuss the solid results across our businesses that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2013.
Our performance in the quarter reflected healthy billed business intense revenue growth a continuation of credit metrics being at historic lows disciplined controlled operating expenses and as a result solid earnings performance.
Since this quarter does mark the end of the full year I will be discussing our full year results which we are also pleased with as they help illustrate some important trends.
During the quarter we made several significant announcements in particular around signing new GNS partnerships and reaching separate settlement agreements with our merchants and regulators.
In addition we helped support small business entity for the fourth consecutive year.
I will discuss some of these initiatives in more detail later on the call.
I would say that there was some complexity to understanding our financial results this quarter.
While the merchant settlement is the most significant new item we also have a number of previously disclosed items that make the year-over-year comparisons more complex including last year’s fourth quarter items the sale of our publishing business at the beginning of October and the few other specific items which I will walk you through as I discuss our results.
To begin with the summary of our Q4 results you can see on Slide 2 that FX adjusted billed business growth was 9%.
Given our spend centric business model this was in the primary driver of our FX adjusted revenue growth of 6%.
Both of these rates of growth are modestly above our full year growth levels reflecting the uptick in the economy and our business that we saw as 2013 progressed.
This level of revenue growth combined with our continued strong operating expense control this year drove net income to $1.3 billion in the quarter.
This was up sharply from the prior year of course due to the items we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Our strong capital position allowed us to continue our share repurchase efforts over the last four quarters we have spend $4 billion buying back shares which cumulatively resulted in our average shares outstanding declining by 4% versus the prior year.
To more meaningfully review the impact of these solid operating results and our share repurchase efforts on EPS it’s important to realize that year-over-year comparisons are impacted by the three items recorded during the fourth quarter of last year as well as this year’s merchant settlement.
Regarding the settlement which we announced in late December it resulted in expenses that lowered fourth quarter EPS this year by approximately $0.04 adjusted for this merchant settlement this year and the three items from the prior year adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter increased from a $1.09 to $1.25.
These solid results helped bring ROE for the period ending -- for the period ending December 31st to 28%.
Overall we feel good about our performance in the quarter especially considering the continued moderate pace of the economic recovery.
Turning now to the full year results for 2013 on slide three.
For context as we enter 2013 there are number questions about our ability to grow revenues and earnings per share in a slow growth environment.
As you recall billings and revenue growth have slowed over the second half of 2012 and there were concerns about the impact of tax increases and the microeconomic environment on our card that were base.
In fact 2013 did turn out to be a year of only modest economic growth.
While we are encouraged by the recent strong sequential increase seen in the U.S.
GDP growth rates it is important to remember that the year-over-year increase in U.S.
GDPs are in the first three quarters of 2013 was just 1.3% 1.6% and 2.0%.
It is this year-over-year increase that relates historically to our billed business growths.
Given this challenging economic environment we were please to be able to generate FX adjusted billings growth of 8% over the full year and FX adjusted revenue growth of 5%.
Importantly both of these metrics exhibited improving trends over the second half of 2013.
Another key focus of our organization during 2013 was on disciplined control of our operating expenses.
On our fourth quarter earnings call last year we disclosed our goal of growing operating expenses excluding the Q4 ‘12 restructuring charge at less than 3% annually during 2013 and 2014.
We more than met this goal during 2013.
The strong control over operating expenses has enabled us to fund greater investments to grow our business and resources to meet our growing compliance demands and to have increased financial flexibility in the face of a slow growth environment.
You will recall that at our financial community meeting in February of last year we laid out several scenarios illustrating our ability to achieve our on average and overtime earnings targets in a variety of economic environment.
Given the slow growth GDP environment we experienced this year our strong capital position and disciplined control of operating expenses were particularly important contributors to our financial performance.
We were able to drive full year EPS of $4.88 which was 25% higher than last year.
Our EPS has now grown at a 13% to compound annual growth rate since 2010 in line with our on average and overtime target to grow earnings per share by 12% to 15%.
Over the same multi-year time period our revenue CAGR has been 6% well below our on average and overtime target of 8% we generally feel positive about this performance given the slow growth economic environment.
I would also remind you that back in 2010 there were concerns about the growth potential of our existing card businesses particularly in an environment with lower levels of consumer spending and borrowing.
Since that time however our performance has given us greater confidence in the continued growth prospects of our card businesses.
Let’s turn now to the more detailed trends starting with billed business on Slide 4.
Our billings growth rate remained healthy given the economy and improved slightly on a reported basis from 7% in Q3 to 8% in the current quarter.
Billed business overall grew by 9% on an FX adjusted basis so it’s consistent with the prior quarter.
The USCS segment which constituted about half of worldwide billed business saw growth increased from 8% during Q3 to 9% in Q4.
Open small business volumes have been a particularly fast growing part of our U.S.
business and ended the year having achieved four consecutive quarters of double digit growth.
As many of you know we will be featuring a discussion on our open business as one of the topics at our upcoming financial community meeting.
We were also pleased to see a modest uptick in growth rate in our GCS segment from 7% to 8% on an FX adjusted basis.
We continue to see particularly strong volumes in GNS which grew by 16% year over year on an FX adjusted basis.
GNS volume growth continues to be highest in the JAPA region powered by strong growth in China and Japan.
Looking at billed business by geographic region on Slide 5.
Consistent with our focus on expanding our business globally total international volumes continued to grow at a faster pace than the total company and were up 11% year over year on an FX adjusted basis.
Billed business growth within the U.S.
region also improved from 8% to 9% during the current quarter.
EMEA continues to be our slowest growth region given the lower rates of economic growth within Europe.
Moving on to loans the other key revenue driver.
We continue to see steady growth in loan balances as shown on Slide 6.
Worldwide loans grew by 3% versus the prior year up from 2% last quarter.
Our growth rate in the U.S.
was 4% which is up slightly from Q3 and continues to outpace the industry average.
Putting it all together down in the revenue slide you see on Slide 7 that overall revenue growth was 5% on a reported basis and on an FX adjusted basis was 6%.
Consistent with our spend-metric model this revenue growth was primarily driven by higher discount revenue from increased spending volumes.
Secondarily revenue growth was aided by net interest income increasing 11% versus the prior year as we experienced lower funding cost year over year along with the increase in average loan balances.
The sale of our publishing business depressed the growth rate of other revenue and impacted total revenue growth by approximately 1% during the fourth quarter.
For this quarter this impact on total revenue was largely offset by the greater amount of card member reimbursements recorded in the prior year.
Going forward the loss of publishing revenue in and of itself will depress total revenue growth by a similar percentage point or a little less over each of the next three quarters.
You see on Slide 7 that the two biggest components of our revenues -- discount revenue and net interest income as well as total revenues were all stronger in the fourth quarter than in the full year reflecting the modest sequential strengthening we saw in the economy and our business.
Turning now to provision where overall our credit metrics remained at all time low levels.
Looking at the metrics highlighted on Slide 8 you can see that worldwide lending write-off rates which were already at historically low levels declined further during the fourth quarter and remained best in class.
The delinquency rates remained consistent with the prior quarter.
Now as a reminder our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best economics when we make investments.
Therefore at some point we would expect that lending write-off rates will increase from today’s historically low levels.
Slide 9 shows that our lending reserve coverage levels also remained relatively consistent with the prior quarter after considering the normal seasonal increase in loan balances.
We believe that our coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Finally as you can see on slide 10 for the full year provision increased by 6% as the benefits from reserve releases were smaller during 2013 than they were in 2012.
While write-off rates have continued to improve and are at historic lows the rate of improvement in 2013 was slower than what we experienced during the prior year.
In the fourth quarter provision was lower by 17% this year which is somewhat out of pattern with the full year results as we benefited from a modest reserve release in this year’s Q4 which is a modest reserve build than in a prior year Q4.
Turning now from the revenue side to the expense side on slide 11 story gets a bit more complex because of the three items we recorded in Q4 2012 and the merchant settlement this quarter.
As of this I will walk you through each individual line item in subsequent slides.
I would make the overall comment that a key to our 2013 results was maintaining disciplined control of our expenses particularly within operating expenses.
This allowed us to achieve solid financial results while continuing to invest for both our current and future customers.
One item I would like to talk about while still on slide 11 is the tax rate.
You see that our tax rate during the quarter was 34% a bit higher than we’ve been trending and expecting.
As we closed the year the final geographic mix of where we generate income came in a little less favorable than we’ve been expecting and drove the higher rate for the quarter.
This brought the full year effective tax rate to 32.1%.
Let me now start the more detailed expense discussion with operating expense since controlling operating expenses to make our business more efficient has been key to providing additional resources for growth initiatives and by any measure our teams did a great job this year of more than meeting our ambitious operating expense goals.
Slide 12 shows you some of the details of our operating expenses during both the quarter and the full year.
And clearly a number of individual lines here were impacted by specific items both this year and last.
So I won’t take the time to go in all of those details but I do want to call out two items.
First other net expense in the quarter includes approximately $66 million of expenses related to the merchant settlement I discussed earlier in which we announced on December 19th.
As part of the settlement we agreed to pay a reasonable attorney fees up to a maximum total of $75 million plus up to $4 million to notify merchants of the settlement terms.
A small portion of these costs were accrued for in prior periods resulting in a net impact of $66 million in the fourth quarter.
Second I would note that sale of our publishing business depressed operating expense growth by little more than 1% in the quarter.
So putting it all together on slide 13 you see that excluding the Q4 ‘12 restructuring charge full year 2013 adjusted operating expenses were flat versus the prior year and remained well below our commitment to grow operating costs at less than 3% annually during 2013.
Looking ahead we remain committed to achieving our goal of having operating expenses grow by less than 3% again during 2014.
So moving to rewards expense a key source of value for our card members.
After excluding the cost of the enhancements to the URR or ultimate redemption rate estimation process for U.S.
card members in the fourth quarter of 2012 adjusted rewards expense were like 13% during the quarter as illustrated on slide 14.
This 13% growth rate in adjusted rewards expense is somewhat higher than the volume growth in our MR and co-brand products due predominantly to two items a benefit in the prior year due to a decline in the weighted average cost per point and an increase in current year quarter due to an enhancement in the URR estimate process in our largest countries outside the U.S.
With this enhancement the global URR will remain at 94%.
As a reminder loyalty and reward programs are one of our major competitive advantages.
Based on their success we have expanded them during the last few years to offer broader opportunities for cardmembers to earn and redeem points.
Turning then to Slide 14 in our marketing and promotion line where significant amount of our investments in growth are.
You see expenses up 12% in Q4 as we took advantage of opportunities to invest in the business while still delivering solid EPS growth.
We were pleased to be able to invest more in this area as the economy and the business strengthened as the year progressed.
We continue to see many attractive opportunities in the marketplace including those for new customer acquisitions.
During the fourth quarter we were particularly pleased to support the Fourth Annual Small Business Saturday.
Momentum for this event continues to grow led by local businesses around the world.
During the current year we supported Small Business Saturday in six countries including the launch of the event in Australia Israel and South Africa.
Importantly this event helps us build relationships with all businesses across both our merchant network and our cardmember base.
This is critical to both the continued strength we see with small business cardmembers and our continual efforts to expand small business merchant coverage.
So more broadly we believe that we continue to have a number of attractive investment opportunities across both our card businesses and from newer initiative.
These opportunities exist across our existing card business -- these opportunities excuse me across our existing card businesses include increasing our penetration of B2B middle market and small business spending continuing to deepen our relationships amongst affluent customers continuing to expand our reach to a broader segment of consumers and expanding our merchant network particularly among smaller merchants.
While all of these areas represent sizable opportunities within the U.S.
market we believe that the long-term potential of these opportunities is even greater internationally where our relative share position today is still significantly lower than it is in the U.S.
As I mentioned on last quarter’s earnings call we also target a portion of our investments for longer-term opportunities including many initiatives in the digital space.
Over the past several years we have increasingly focused our efforts on two large initiatives: reloadable prepaid our products that help you move and manage your money as well as our Loyalty Partner rewards coalition program.
Both of these efforts continue to ramp up and we believe that they provide significant opportunities for growth.
This growth however will occur over a longer period.
Last a common theme across all of these new initiatives is that they improve our ability to reach new customer segments and help make our brand more inclusive.
So given the breadth and depth of opportunities that we have which are financially sound one of the challenges we have is how to balance our investments with our performance against our on average and over time financial targets.
As I mentioned earlier you did see us increase our investment spending in the latter half of 2013 as the economy and our business improved.
Historically this approach has led to fluctuations in our investment levels over time.
For example during 2010 and 2011 our operating and marketing expenses increased as a result of our strategy to re-invest a portion of the Visa MasterCard settlement gains and the benefits from improving credit performance back into growing the business.
We are completing our planning process for 2014 currently and well as always be thoughtful and prioritized which investments we will fund.
Of relevance here are our plans to create a joint-venture to accelerate the transformation of our global business travel division.
As an update the negotiations for the joint venture continue to advance as we had planned.
Our best estimate for closing date remains the second quarter 2014.
Upon closing it is expected that our partners will infuse a $700 million to $1 billion capital contribution into the new joint venture.
American Express would contribute the assets of our business - travel business.
As a result we would expect to realize a meaningful P&amp;L gain upon the close of the transaction.
This could offer us some additional financial flexibility during 2014.
So turning now to capital our strong capital position and the sizeable amount of new capital we generate through net income each quarter provide significant flexibility.
This allows us to balance the capital needs in our businesses our desire to remain strong capital ratios and the potential for significant capital returns to our shareholders.
The benefits of our strong capital position were on display all year as we returned 81% capital generated in the year to shareholders.
We did this while modestly strengthening our already strong capital ratio year-over-year as you can see on slide 16.
As usual you do our capital ratios decline slightly sequentially during the fourth quarter due to the seasonal increase in our loan and receivable balances.
We did of course complete our submission for the 2014 CCAR process earlier this month and we will expect to hear back from the Fed about our submission in March.
Like the rest of the industry we have worked hard to continue to strengthen aspects of our capital planning processes which supports this critical effort.
While it is too early to know how this process will play out for 2014 I will say personally that going through this planning process for the first time has furthered my own confidence and the strength of our business model and capital structure.
Part of the strength has been our continuing efforts to evolve the mix of our funding sources which you can see on slide 17.
We have worked hard to improve the diversity of our funding sources by driving a significant increase in the contribution from deposits over the last several years.
At this point we believe our funding mix should be relatively stable going forward.
Overall our liquidity position remained strong and we continue to hold enough cash to cover our next 12 months of funding maturities.
Turning to other events of the last quarter let me first make just a few more general comments on the two settlement announcements we made the financial aspects of which I have already touched on.
During the quarter we announced that we agreed to settle two antitrust class actions filed by U.S.
merchants that challenged specific provisions in the company’s card acceptance agreements.
The settlement agreement if approved will address certain merchant concerns while helping to ensure that American Express card members are treated fairly at point of sale.
We also expected to limit the company’s exposure to future legal claims and ensure that any credit and charge surcharge on American Express card transactions would be no more than the surcharge charge on competing credit for charge card products.
The settlement is presently under-review by the court.
Some of the merchants that have cases pending against the company have objected to the settlement.
Any objections or concerns will be considered by the court as it determines whether to approve the settlement.
During the quarter we’ve also announced that we had reached settlements to resolve previously disclosed reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several discontinued products that were previously offered to card members.
Marketing of the products included in these settlement was discontinued more than a year ago.
Most of the card member reimbursements have already taken place and most of the cost associated with those reimbursements as well as the fines were provided for in prior periods.
The regulatory environment has evolved significantly and has heightened the focus that all the financial companies must have on their controls and processes.
We take our regulatory obligations very seriously.
As we have discussed we continue to scrutinize and improve our card practices regulators wants companies to be clear transparent and fair to their customers a goal that is very consistent with our own objective.
As previously reported American Express continues to conduct internal reviews designed to identify issues correct them and ensure that our products and practices need a high standard of quality.
Before I conclude I wanted to touch on one other item that has been getting a lot of attention.
The recent data breach at Target.
We continue to work closely with Target and law reinforcement on the investigations and we are closely monitoring the situation as it evolves.
We have sophisticated monitoring systems and internal safeguards in place to protect cardmember accounts and to detect fraudulent activities.
We have the appropriate broad controls in place on affected accounts and are continuing to take targeted actions as needed.
We have seen minimal exposure thus far.
The closed loop is a big advantage for us especially in situations like this.
Our relationships with cardmembers and merchants represent one of the reasons why our fraud rates are the lowest in the industry.
So in summary coming back to our financial results we feel very good about our overall performance in the current economic environment.
During the quarter we saw healthy billings growth and modest growth in loan balances which drove FX adjusted revenue growth of 6%.
This revenue growth combined with historically low credit metrics disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong capital position allowed us to generate a healthy growth in EPS while still investing in the growth opportunities we see in the marketplace.
Looking forward we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders.
With that I’ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate.
Operator?  (Operator Instructions) First we’ll go to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.
So with the stock having traded up a fair amount recently and also revenue growth still kind of below target does this increase your interest in all and using excess capital to do acquisitions versus buying back stock here? Well I think when you look at the company’s history we have selectively used acquisitions over the years when we see an opportunity to either enhance our capabilities or build upon an existing strength of the company in an area.
And certainly as we think about our long-term strategies we are always looking for opportunities to do that.
All that said when you think about our policies on using our capital while on average and over time we’ve said we will return about 50% of our capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and use the other 50% for other growth initiatives or acquisitions.
Acquisitions are the kinds of things that you can’t really predict and you really need to be very thoughtful about when you find the right opportunity.
And when we don’t have those opportunities we’re very committed to returning capital to shareholder and that’s what you saw us do in 2013.
And so when you think about the future it’s very hard to predict and I think our commitment is to be thoughtful about anything we do on the acquisition side and be very consistent in returning capital to shareholders when they’re are not opportunities that we think are great opportunities on the acquisition side.
And then just to follow up I was hoping I can get you to quantify what you meant by meaningful P&amp;L gain from the closing of the JV and comment on whether you included that in your capital plan submission? So two separate questions.
So the size of the gain -- I will tell you beyond saying it will be a material gain there are still so many moving pieces as we work through the last part of this that I am probably not comfortable giving you a number.
I would point out that if you think about the math it’s pretty simple.
If the partner puts in $700 million to $1 billion we’ve got 50% ownership and re-contribute our assets that will define the value if you will of what the joint venture will be worth and then what gain will drop out will be a function of what is on our books as we contribute the business travel enterprise to the joint venture.
So it will be a material gain.
I can’t really give you a range today.
As we thought about our CCAR submission what I would say to you is that what we convinced ourselves though and made the point of to the Fed in the submission is that in any circumstance even though there is still a range of outcomes here we would see that the transaction will be accretive or positive to our capital ratios.
And so while we can’t quantify it’s all upside and then we built our CCAR submission on an assumption that it would be neutral to positive.
But we didn’t -- the way these things work we want to build a share repurchase plan based on the certainty that it would happen.
Yeah.
Thank you.
And next we will go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Yeah.
Following-up on that last comment I guess when we think about your CCAR submission are you anticipating just keep a -- targeting a flat capital ratio and basically paying out consistent with what you did in 2013? And then could you have built in a contingency that upon the sale if that were to happen you would use that excess capital towards capital management activities? And then I guess secondly just on the tax rate could you just tell us how we should think about the level going forward? Thank you.
So on CCAR I would say we certainly did not build in a contingency.
I don’t think that really fits with the way the CCAR process have evolved to thus far as run by the fed.
More broadly when we think about our CCAR submission we clearly do a tremendous amount of work internally and have a tremendous amount of discussion and debate amongst the management team and with our Board of Directors.
And it is really all aims are trying to balance the views of our regulators the views of our shareholders and our own views about the strength of our capital structure and our future performance.
I think that leads you to what we submitted and I don’t want to get into the details of what we submitted.
But I think our history would show that we are pretty committed to consistently being shareholder friendly.
We believe that our capital structure is strong and within that set of thoughts we submitted what we thought was a very balanced submission and we’ll see how it goes.
On the tax rate geographic mix does vary a little bit.
If you look over the last few years our tax rate has consistently been in the low 30s but it’s varied a little bit between about 30% to 32% on a full annual basis.
And we don’t necessarily see anything that we learned this year that suggest we will be outside that historical range.
Beyond that probably is a little hard to predict exactly what will happen in terms of the mix and other items next year.
All right.
Great.
Thank you.
Next we’ll go to the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
All right.
Good evening.
Thank you.
Could you spend a little time and may be discuss some of the seasonal factors that impact the discount rate.
You’ve had several fourth quarters where you have a significant reduction in discount rate.
It tends to snap back in the first quarter.
Can you just remind us what those seasonal factors are if you can quantify them that would be helpful as well? Yeah.
It is probably tough to specifically quantify but the basic trend is pretty simple.
If you think about the fourth quarter you have a little spurred upwards in retail spend and a little decline in some of the more business-oriented spend.
And that mix shift is quite consistent each year and drives the discount rate down very very modestly and that’s why you see it pop back up in Q1.
And are there are any other just either pricing or deal related factors that are more first quarter seasonal or fourth quarter seasonal that impact then? No.
No it’s really just that simple mix shift..
Okay.
And maybe just lastly you had mentioned that you’re going to balance out essentially the gain that may be taken from the sale of the Business Travel.
I just want to make sure I understand this right.
So basically you’re going to look to keep your investments at an elevated level in terms of just driving future growth.
But you’re possibly going to have some of that fall of the bottom line is that the way to think about the balancing act that you have got to look out there? Well I want to be a little careful because this is a potential joint venture.
I think the point I was trying to make in my prepared remarks is we have a long track record of being very thoughtful about how we balance our on average and over time financial targets with steadily investing in the many growth opportunities that we see.
And it is certainly possible that as we get into 2014 and as we execute on the business travel joint venture you may see an elevated level of investments depending on how all the final economics work out.
And we will be as we always are thoughtful about making those investments in things that are going to produce very good returns for our shareholders and we will be very transparent about what we are doing and why.
And next we’ll go to the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.
A couple of questions.
First the Target breach.
Do you think this is a potential accelerator to EMV adoption and could you see regulatory involvement pushing that along? Well I think it’s early for anyone to know exactly what all of the impacts of the Target breach will be.
Although there is obviously already a line of regulators and other oversight authorities who have expressed interest and understanding what’s going on.
I think from our perspective we have a tremendous dedication to the security of everything that goes on between our merchants and our cardmembers.
We have the lowest fraud rates in the industry.
Our closed loop gives us some real advantages here in helping to manage things.
And there are many things we can do with our merchant partners frankly that help lower fraud rates.
Moving towards new technologies like EMV is one of those things.
But frankly there are many others and they all have different costs and difference trade-offs.
Certainly it has long been our goal to work ever more closely with our merchant partners to lower rates of fraud.
We think that this may spur greater interest in doing that.
The exact form it takes I think is probably anyone’s guess at this point.
Secondly thinking about the cardmember services expense line it’s been in the press that the American Airlines lounge relationship has left American Express.
I was wondering if we’re going to see any type of either adjustment lower for that the end of that relationship or a ratchet-up in spending to account for replacing that service whether that’s through Centurion Lounge construction or other things? Well I think we probably start by thinking about this from the customer or cardmembers’ perspective.
And we have a long track record of doing lots of things that make all of our products valuable propositions for the customer.
In the specific case of the Platinum Card that is a card really targeted to people who travel a lot.
There is a wide range of benefits that people get from the Platinum Card including I would point out even post once the American Airlines announcement goes into effect which I believe is March we will have access to three different sets of lounges - Delta as well as two others Priority Pass and Airspace.
We have a variety of credits that we offer to customers on cost of global entry and other airline fees.
You are correct that we are experimenting with building our own lounges and they’ve met quite a rousing reception thus far in the two that we’ve opened in Las Vegas and Dallas.
And we’ve announced plans already to open a couple others at LaGuardia in New York and in San Francisco.
So we see and we also feel that we remain very competitive because if you think about it with the consolidation in the airline industry and I would remind you as someone who was the CFO of American Airlines 12 years ago there were a lot more airlines when I was the CFO there.
As the airlines have consolidated you’re really left today with sort of no card is going to give you access to any broader set of lounges than what our Platinum Card does and that’s sort of what airline consolidation has done.
So we feel very good about the customer proposition and we think we have a long track record of being innovative about how we continually evolve that proposition.
So it is a great value to customers and that is that will drive all of I think ultimately yes that will fall into our P&amp;L and have an impact on the cardmember services line.
But I think frankly the best way to think about that is I would not expect this to have any material impact one way or the other as we continually find ways to provide value to our customers.
Thank you.
Next we’ll go through line of James Friedman with SIG.
Hi.
Thanks.
I want to ask about an update on the Wells and U.S.
Bank partnership.
Jeff how should we think about sizing that say in the year ahead in terms of cards-in-force? Well so we are very excited about both the Wells Fargo and U.S.
Bank relationships and we see it as a really great commentary and the many things we can bring to our partners in this kinds of relationships.
Now it is a long and complex thing for large institutions to launch new products.
The first thing I do want to point out as well.
Wells has begun to launch a few small test markets.
These deals will actually take several years to fully rollout and reach some level of maturity.
We’re clearly very excited about the longer term potential of both of these partnerships and we think for both of those institutions we can really help them achieve any of the business goals they have and further their penetration particularly amongst their own customer basis and help them grow their card businesses to be more commensurate frankly with the broader size of those two institutions.
But this will play out over a longer time period and so I probably don’t want to size it beyond those general comments.
Okay.
And then if I could a follow-up on with regard to Serve and Bluebird if you could talk in general terms about what we should expect with the revenue mix between fee and transaction revenue overtime how does the company think about the revenue generation from those products? Well clearly on the prepaid products you have both a range of fee revenue.
Although I would point out to you that we have worked very hard going back to some ways my comments about the Platinum Card.
We have worked very hard to start with the customer proposition and I think you would find that we have two of the lowest fee products in the market with the widest range of functionality and features for the consumer and that’s exactly where we want to be on the continuum here.
When you think about the economics you have a range of both revenues from fees as well as of course the point-of-sale or discount revenue.
And you also have to think about it in the broader context of the family of products in the many different customer segments that American Express targets reaches.
So we look at all those things as we look at the economic model for Serve and for Bluebird and we are still in early stages I would point out to you we just re-launched the Serve product for example a few months ago.
But we’re encouraged by the early signs and we think this is a market that over the years will grow to be a very significant market.
Thank you so much.
Next we will go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities.
Thank you.
For my first question I was hoping to revisit the points that were raised regarding the closing of the JV.
So just to put balance around the potential magnitude of gain if hypothetically there was a zero book value to the assets on AmEx’s book spend since this is a 50-50 JV and the partners contribution is valued at somewhere between $700 million to $1 billion and presumably AmEx’s contribution would be valued at the same level.
So at zero book value then the maximum theoretical gain would be between $700 million to $1 billion? And then I guess if we looked at that in terms of let’s say the book value was not zero but if the book value was $500 million then would that suggest the maximum gain is $200 million to $500 million am I thinking about that the right way? Yeah.
You’re thinking about it exactly the right way.
The two things I’d remind you about are these kinds of quite complex transactions do not come without a tremendous amount of effort and cost by both internal and external resources.
And then I’d also remind you that our Business Travel business is a highly global business which produces a very complex structure and will produce a very complex tax outcome which is part of what we are still working through.
But with those two editions yes it really is as simple as what you just took us through.
Great.
Thank you.
And then for my follow-up question if I may it has two parts the first part on revenues the second part on expenses.
So on the revenue part I was hoping that you could touch on the 4.5 times multiplier effect that AmEx has historically enjoyed relative to GDP and billings growth relative to that relationship is that something you still believe in? In other words I guess I’m just wondering if there’s any reason to believe that that’s 4.5 times multiplier effect will continue to hold? And then finally on the expense portion of that it was good to hear you guys reaffirmed your commitment to keeping operating expense growth below 3% I guess separate from that I was wondering your expense ratio I believe was at 70% this quarter should we still expect that ratio to continue to work its way down towards the more normal 2007 levels that you guys have talked about of 67%? Yeah.
So on the 4.5 the interesting thing is if you look actually at the data we have this year we don’t have GDP data of course for Q4.
The 4.5 historical relationships still seems like a pretty good metric when you look at the most recent quarters and just to make sure everyone on the call is clear that’s applying that 4.5 ratio to year-over-year real GDP.
I had to train myself a little bit since I joined American Express six months ago much of the media talks about sequential rates of GDP growth but what we’re talking is the year-over-year number.
And I would say we’re not saying -- we are not necessarily actually trying to make any commentary on correlation but we are saying when you just look at the math that historical relationship has existed.
To go to the operating expense ratio you’re right I think it’s for the full year of 2013 we ended at 70% I believe we were at 71% last year if you exclude the restructuring and other charges.
The point I would make is we are very committed to the operating expense goals that we have laid out very publicly for over a year now and that is keeping our operating expense growth in 2014 to less than 3% as we did in 2013.
Beyond that I would say we want to be a little cautious about driving to other expense ratios because what we are always trying to do is meet our bottom line on average over time targets particularly around EPS while still being really thoughtful about how we can most productively and with the highest returns invest in growth opportunities for our shareholders.
And those growth opportunities come in different forms.
Sometimes it takes just traditional advertising and promotional spend other times it means hiring sales people who runs our operation expense.
And you get different impacts depending on which ratio you want to manage.
And so and I would say our real commitment is to working towards continuing to meet our on-average and over time bottom line targets and for 2014 meeting that operating expense target.
Next we’ll go to the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O’Neill.
Thanks for taking my call or my question.
I wanted to just explore one other point on the JV and I respect the complexity here.
But trying to understand the cost basis is it safe to think about this as parts of the cost basis have really been in place for decades and so it would come in a pretty low book value but other parts like newer technology are much more modern? Is that sort of wide parameters for thinking about it? I’ll tell you the complexity of this is great because you are correct.
There are some parts of this business that are quite old.
I would also tell you they’re very very intertwined.
We have for most of our long history in the travel business run it in a pretty integrated fashion with other parts of our company that we’ll retain.
I’d remind you that over the years we have done a number of acquisitions which adds complexity.
It is a highly global business.
So maybe this goes a little bit to the point I made in response to the earlier question about there are deal costs there are transaction costs.
And part of them go to just sorting through how do we really cleanly create a separate entity and how do we make sure that we understand all of the financial and legal and tax implications.
And I’ll stop there because I don’t want to sound overly apologetic.
But for all of those reasons it’s just difficult to give you a better estimate at this point.
Understood.
Just to kind of appreciate what all is involved here.
And then to shift gears on to the settlement announced on December 19 I was a little surprised that the word “surcharge” appeared as frequently as it did in the summary of the terms and is the right way to look at this as sort of an abundance of legal caution for an outcome in the United States that has more [surcharging or is this] saying that we are going to be in a world where surcharging is more common? I am just trying to put this in the right context.
Well I certainly would quickly say we do not expect the outcome you had at the end of your statement there.
So let me step back for a minute.
So I’ll make a few points.
And I might almost start with look we are out there every single day working to build relationships with our merchant partners.
And we are really all about helping them grow their businesses we’re not about being in litigation with them.
And so part of what we are trying to do here is find a way to put this litigation behind us and begin to work more productively with all of our merchant partners.
What we get out of the agreement is a clear commitment that our card members will be treated fairly relative to other credit and charge card customers of any other institution.
That is very important to us.
We think there is tremendous value there.
We also believe and we are long on public record about this that surcharging is a very consumer and customer unfriendly practice.
I’d remind you that surcharging is outlawed in a number of states in the U.S.
And I’d also remind you that there are many countries all around the globe of course where we do business which have all many different regulatory regimes.
And In those where surcharging has been allowed it has not become a rampant practice we think because merchants recognize that it is just not a customer-friendly practice.
So when all is said and done we thought this settlement was a good think for our shareholders was a good thing for our merchant partners and allow us to get back to running the business and building relationships.
Got it.
Thank you.
Next we will go to the line of Don Fandetti with Citi.
Jeff you would mentioned in your commentary about China benefiting your G&amp;S business? I was just curious if that’s just normal growth or if you are gaining market share that would seem like that could be a good opportunity to sign up other banks? I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and just confirm that the economics are generally the same from region to region at G&amp;S.
Yeah.
Well I do think it is important to be very clear about what I said about China.
So our China growth in billings has been tremendous and has been a significant though not the only part of why you see particularly high growth rates when we breakout billed business for you either by segment it’s in the GNS segment or by region where you see it in the JAPA region and we’re very pleased by that billings growth.
But I would remind you that in China as you would really see for all foreign payments players today we earn very little revenue on the domestic spend within China and then we do much better on what we would call the outbound spend and that’s just due to the regulatory environment in China.
So longer term we think it’s really important that we establish as larger presence as we can in China and we have a number of different business things that we’re doing in China.
One of which is reflected in the great growth in billed business that you see I just want to be a little cautious in saying that that billed business does not today generate particularly material amounts of revenue or earnings.
I understand that I was just curious if on your cross-border out of China if you feel like there’s room to sign up for other banks to grow that business and are the economics similar to what you’d see in another region even though knowing it’s a small contribution to revenue? Well we are continually exploring different opportunities in China.
I certainly don’t want to get into exactly who we are talking to and what our strategies are in China.
Let me just say that we see it as a very exciting long-term market.
We think our brand carries into China very well.
I think the billing growth that you are seeing demonstrates that and we think that it is creating a number of interesting opportunities for us but I really don’t want to comment beyond that.
Okay.
Thanks.
We probably have time for about one more question operator.
Okay.
And that will come from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Thank you and good afternoon.
The spending growth accelerated nicely in the U.S.
in the fourth quarter.
It had a small acceleration but important and I was wondering if you could give a little more color on that if the online spending growth which I think is about 20% of your spend if that there was an outsized acceleration in online spend.
And then just related to that I mean you seem to think that the economy was helpful how does -- what is American Express’s view on how the economy going into 2014? Well so let me -- maybe answer those in reverse.
Certainly in terms of the economy we don’t profess to have any greater insights our business is not necessary a leading indicator.
So I would tell you we build our internal plans around a consensus economists forecast of what GDP in the U.S.
and many other markets around the globe is going to be.
And I think we are pretty transparent about our sensitivity to what economic growth actually ends up to be and so we hope that it turns out to be frankly as strong as sum of the consensus economists are saying.
When you look at Q4 certainly like all payment forms we see tremendously high growth rates in online spend.
We’re not going to provide today any specific numbers about Q4 I would just make the obvious point that like other players the growth rates in online spend are quite high.
It still remains a more modest piece of the total.
I think the most important thing though for us as we think about trends and what we saw over the course of 2013 does come back to the point I made earlier that we are pleased by the fact that when you look at the back half of the year you saw an acceleration across billings and across revenues versus what you saw in the first half.
So we think that’s a good trend as we head into 2014 whatever the economic environment may be.
Great.
Thank you.
Great.
So I’d like to thank you all for your time and Operator I think we’re done.
Thanks for your interest in American Express.
Thank you.
And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.
Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.
(Operator Instructions) And also as a reminder today's teleconference is being recorded.
At this time I'll turn the conference call over to your host Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you Tony.
Welcome we appreciate all of you joining us for today's call.
The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company's other reports already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2014 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed.
All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed.
Once Jeff completes his remarks we will move to a Q&amp;A session.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.
Well thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone.
Our performance this quarter showed strong earnings per share growth driven by disciplined controlled of operating expenses another quarter of write-off rates near historical lows and a strong balance sheet that has allowed us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over the past year.
We delivered 16% EPS growth despite having modestly lower revenue growth sequentially.
And these results highlighted once again the flexibility of our business model.
During the quarter we took several important strategic steps including rolling out our OptBlue program to expand the coverage amongst smaller merchants launching a new credit Amex EveryDay designed to capture a greater share of everyday consumer spending; and expanding Loyalty Partner by introducing the program in Italy.
All of these steps are part of our broader strategy to reach new segments of the market and make the American Express brand more welcoming and more inclusive.
Additionally in the quarter we were pleased that the Fed did not object to the capital plan included in our 2014 CCAR submission.
And we were also pleased to sign the formal agreement for the Business Travel joint venture that we announced last year.
I'll discuss each of these items in more detail later on the call.
To begin now with our financial results for Q1.
As you can see on Slide 2 FX adjusted billed business growth was 7%.
This increase was the primary driver of FX adjusted revenue growth of 5%.
Both of these growth rates represent a modest deceleration versus Q4 levels which occurred predominantly in the U.S.
market and was more pronounced among our U.S.
small business and corporate card members.
Net income of $1.4 billion was up 12%.
The increase was driven by a combination of greater revenues continued tight control of operating expense.
Over the last four quarters we repurchased more than $4 billion of our common shares that translated into a 4% decline in average shares outstanding versus the prior year.
This then allowed us to grow our diluted EPS by 16%.
These results call to mind the presentation we made at our Investor Day in February of last year when we laid out several scenarios illustrating our ability to achieve our on average and over time earnings targets in a variety of economic environments.
Given the slower revenue growth we experienced during the first quarter our strong capital position and disciplined control of operating expenses were particularly important contributors to our financial performance and helped to drive 16% increase in earnings per share to $1.33.
These results also brought our ROE for the period ending March 31 to 28% above our on average and over time target of 25%.
Let's turn now to a more detailed look at several trends that will give you a better sense of the quarter starting with billed business on Slide 3.
Overall billings remained solid with an FX adjusted increase of 7% versus 9% last quarter.
The sequentially slower growth was primarily in the U.S.
where billings rose 6% in Q1 compared to 9% during Q4.
I said a minute ago this decline was more evident among our small business and corporate card members.
Additionally volume growth rate appeared to be influenced in part by the severe winter weather.
I would add that while we are always cautious about drawing conclusions from intra-period trends we were encouraged to see that U.S.
billing growth increased over the second half of the quarter as the weather improved.
Outside the U.S.
where volumes continue to growth at a faster pace than the total company billed business was up 10% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis.
Overall growth rates across international regions were generally consistent with the prior quarter and we did see a small uptick in EMEA from 6% in Q4 to 7% in the current quarter.
Turning to billed business by segment on Slide 4 volumes continue to be particularly strong in GNS up 15% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis.
GNS growth continues to be highest in the JAPA region powered largely by China and Japan.
You do see across both the regional and segment view of our billings that the stronger U.S.
dollar continued to put downward pressure on our billings and hence revenue growth as has been the case for the last five quarters.
To give you a better sense of the drivers here we have provided on Slide 5 some background on the major concentrations of our billed business by international currency.
The first row shows the approximate range of billed business in each market as the percentage of total billed business.
While the bottom row shows the year-over-year change in that foreign currency compared to the U.S.
dollar.
Overall in Q1 this mix translated into approximately one percentage point reduction in both billings and revenue growth.
Moving on now to loans the other key revenue driver.
We see on Slide 6 that loan balances grew 3% globally.
U.S.
loans were up 4% from a year ago.
Both of these growth rates are consistent with what we saw in Q4.
I’ll also note that the total level of loans declined $3.2 billion versus Q4 which is in line with normal seasonal trends.
We are pleased that our loan growth in the U.S.
continues to outpace the industry average.
Putting all the pieces of revenue together you see on Slide 7 the total revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX adjusted basis.
Consistent with our spend-centric model this growth was primarily driven by the discount revenue growth that was generated by increased spending volumes.
The other primary driver of revenue growth was an 8% increase in net interest income as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding cost and an increase in average loan balances.
Another point I would make about our revenues was that the sale of our publishing business last year continues to depress the growth rate of other revenue and impacted total revenue growth this quarter by a little less than 1%.
Turning now to provision.
You can see on Slide 8 that our credit metrics remain near all time lows.
Worldwide lending write-off and delinquency rates increased slightly in the quarter consistent with seasonal trends.
As a reminder our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best economics on our portfolio.
Therefore at some point we would expect that lending write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels.
Slide 9 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels.
We believe that our coverage levels remain appropriate even the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
The fact that our delinquency rates have become more stable and our loan portfolio was growing resulted in a smaller reserve release in the first quarter and a year ago.
The smaller reserve release more than offset the benefit from lower write-offs this year and grow total provision up 17% compared to a year ago as you can see on Slide 10.
The increase in the charge card provision in particular is primarily due to a reserve billed in the current year versus a reserve release in the prior year along with higher card member receivables.
I'll also note that beginning this quarter we have reclassified fraud losses from provision for losses to operating expenses in order to be more consistent with industry practices.
This had the effect of lowering provision and increasing operating expense so we have reclassified prior periods for this change to keep everything comparable.
Turning now to expenses.
On Slide 11 you can see the total expenses were down 1% versus the prior year.
Clearly maintaining disciplined control of expenses particularly our operating expenses was the key driver behind our strong earnings performance during the quarter.
To comment on a few specifics you see that while marketing and promotion was relatively flat in this quarter going forward we do anticipate that investment levels will increase as we move into Q2.
For rewards expense you see growth that was relatively consistent with our billed business growth during the quarter.
The key story around expenses is obviously operating expenses.
And we provide more detail on these on Slide 12 which shows a 4% decline in total operating expenses versus the prior year with lower expenses seen across every line.
We did benefit from the timing of certain items this quarter.
But also remind you that the sale of our publishing business continues to suppress operating expense growth by a little more than one percentage point.
That said our operating expense decline this quarter went well beyond our goal for the full year of keeping growth to less than 3% as you can see on Slide 13.
Of course we remain committed to our annual target.
But we would not expect to see similar declines in the remaining quarters of the year.
To turn more broadly now to our marketing and promotion efforts to grow our business Slide 14 shows that these expenses were relatively flat versus a year ago in Q1.
As you can see on the chart marketing and promotion is typically lower during Q1 and ramps up beginning in Q2.
We continue to see many attractive opportunities in the market place including those for new customer and merchant acquisitions.
To be specific during the quarter we launched Amex EveryDay a new credit card that rewards card members for how often they use the card not just how much they spend.
The reward structure intends card member to use the card for everyday purchases at the places they frequent most.
We are excited about the potential of the product to attract new customer segments to our franchise.
At our Investor Day in February we introduced OptBlue the next step in the evolution of our merchant acquiring program in the U.S.
OptBlue give small merchants the convenience of working with our network of third party merchant acquirers who have the flexibility to give them one pricing construct one monthly statement one settlement process and one contract that covers all of the major card brands the merchant chooses to accept.
In February we reported that we had signed six merchant acquirers to the program.
Since then we have continued to add partners and believe OptBlue will provide a significant lift to our small merchant acquisition efforts as it is rolled out.
And we continue to target a portion of our investment for longer term opportunities in particular focusing on two large initiatives.
Reloadable Prepaid a product that help you move and manage your money and Loyalty Partner our rewards coalition program.
These initiatives continue to ramp up as evidenced by this quarter's launch of our Loyalty Partner program in Italy where we now have over 3.5 million collectors as of the end of March.
A common theme across all of these new initiatives is to have the American Express brand be more welcoming and inclusive; to be meaningful to more people and more merchants.
To return now to the financial.
Turning to Slide 15 you see that during the first quarter our effective tax rate was 35.1%.
This is the second quarter in a row that our tax rate has been somewhat higher than the recent past.
Tax rate as you know often fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to a variety of discreet items.
More importantly over the longer term we have seen modest increase in our average effective tax rate primarily because of the changes in the geographic mix of where we generate income.
Additionally in 2014 we are being impacted by certain changes in tax laws including the delay in the renewal of the active financing exemption and the loss of the R&amp;D tax credit.
In the past we've mentioned that we expected our average effective tax rate to be in the low 30s range.
When you look at the trend we now believe that our rate for the full year could be closer to the mid 30s.
And a last note on tax I would point out that our tax rate at Q2 2013 was just 29.6%.
It was unusually low and was driven by certain discreet tax items.
A challenge we will face in this year second quarter where will be growing over the impact of this lower rate.
Now let's turn to capital.
The substantial amount of new capital regenerate provides us with significant degrees of flexibility as shown on Slide 16.
This quarter we were able to return 73% of capital to shareholders while also strengthening our already strong capital operations.
And we have worked hard to continue to strengthen all aspects of our capital planning processes.
In last month we were pleased that the Fed did not object to capital plan included in 2014 CCAR submission.
The good news from the Fed underscore both our balance sheet's strength and our ability to remain profitable under hypothetical severe stress scenario while also reflecting the strength of our overall planning processes.
In fact in the Fed severe scenario we have the highest pretax income as a percentage of assets among all bank holding companies and our Tier 1 common ratio both before and after capital actions were in the top quartile as you can see on Slide 17.
These results give us a leeway to increase our dividend by 13% beginning in the second quarter and to repurchase up to $3.4 billion of shares during the last three quarters of 2014 with up to an additional $1 billion during Q1 2015.
That represents a payout ratio that would be among the highest of all the CCAR participants.
Our capital plan focused on three important priorities.
Supporting our growth strategy maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning a significant amount of the capital regenerate to our shareholders.
One aspect of a strong balance sheet is maintaining a good mix of funding sources.
And as you can see on Slide 18 we have improved the diversity of funding sources by building a significantly larger deposit base over the last several years.
At this point we believe our funding mix should be relatively stable going forward.
Before concluding I want to provide an update on the plans for our business travel joint venture.
It's a reminder; our global business travel organization provides corporate customers with 24x7 support for travel in more than 135 countries.
The agreement we signed this quarter entails our partners investing $900 million and the company contributing the assets of our business travel business to the joint venture.
The new structure should provide greater resources to grow the business as a separate entity while maintaining important linkages with American Express.
We still plan for the transaction to close by the end of the second quarter.
However as is the case with most sizable transactions there are regulatory aspects that could delay the transaction closing date.
That we could receive regulatory approval very late in the second quarter which due to the complexity of the closing process could push back or second quarter earnings release date.
We will keep you posted on the timing as we progress through the second quarter.
More importantly we expect to realize a sizable pretax gain which we currently estimate to be between $600 million to $700 million prior to considering any cost related to the transaction.
As we have said before we plan to use a substantial portion of any gain net of transaction cost to position the company for the future.
This will include supporting some of our newer growth initiatives including Amex EveryDay and Serve as well initiative to increase the efficiency of the organization among other efforts.
When we release Q2 results we plan to provide additional detail to give you a clear understanding of our underline performance the resulting gain on the transaction and associated cost incremental spending and growth in other initiatives as well as the expected impact the JV will have as we present our results in the future.
So in summary coming back to our first quarter result.
Our strong earnings performance makes us feel good about the flexibility of our business model.
We generated EPS growth above our on average and over time target driven by disciplined control of operating expenses our strong capital position and continued low write-off rate.
While billings and revenue growth slowed modestly from the first quarter our financial performance was solid.
Looking forward we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enabled us to deliver significant value to our shareholders.
With that I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with only one follow up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate.
Operator? (Operator Instructions).
Our first question will come from Craig Maurer with CLSA.
Please go ahead.
Yes good evening guys thanks.
I wanted to understand your thought process on the spending trend in the quarter and how the shift of Easter into April affected the year-over-year comparison?  Well I guess I would say couple things about the spending trend.
As I said the sequential decline was clearly stronger amongst the small business and corporate card member segment.
I think it is also important to point out that the sequential trend across the quarter and well that's something we are always very cautious as you know Craig to draw too much attention to because there is inherent volatility when you look at any short term period.
But we did see the second half being stronger than the first.
And I would say in the first few days of April we haven't seen anything that contradicts that general trend.
We do lots of internal analysis where we make a number of adjustments to how we look at our spending considering exactly what the days are or the week are in this period trying to use historical patterns around holidays to make adjustments so when I make comments about trends they are considering all of those adjustments.
All that said there is clearly some art to doing something like an adjustment for a holiday like Easter that moves around quite a bit from year-to-year.
So we take what we think is a fairly sophisticated approach to those adjustments but there are some subjectivity to it.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.
Please go ahead Yes good evening.
Jeff it looked like the March data suggest some slight uptick in year-over-year loan growth in the U.S.? Are you seeing any signs of increase consumer appetite for debt or are we just still in a holding pattern? Well when you look at our loan growth Don it is actually been pretty consistent for the last few quarters at around 3% to 4% globally it was 3% this quarter little higher in the U.S.
4%.
And when you look as you know at the industry data the industry has been bouncing around flat sometimes down little bit.
I think the February year-to-date numbers were up about half a point in the U.S.
So we have certainly been pleased by the fact that our loan growth was holding steady at a little bit above that industry average.
But frankly you don't see anything in our first quarter result that suggest any particular acceleration of that trend or do we see it yet in the industry data we’ve looked at.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Mark DeVries from Barclays.
Please go ahead.
Yes thanks.
Jeff I know you indicated that we shouldn't expect to see OpEx remain at this kind of down 4% year-over-year level going forward.
But if you don't see a meaningful acceleration of billed business growth particularly with the modest headwind we have now from kind of higher tax rate is it reasonable to think you’ll have to remain kind of well below the cap of 3% growth if you want the hit the on average over time targets for EPS growth this year? Well I think Mark that's a very good question really goes to the flexibility of our business model.
As I said in my earlier comments I would actually take you and other folks back to the February FCM when we showed that we have a quite a number of levers that we can pull and have a history of pulling.
So certainly I would stick to the remarks I made a few minutes ago that the 4% decline year-over-year you see in the first quarter is not indicative of what you would expect -- should expect the next couple of quarters there were some timing items.
But we are very committed to using the flexibility of our business model to achieve our earnings targets.
I think we have a pretty strong track record pulling various levers and how much we let operating expenses and other expenses grow over the remainder of this year will certainly be heavily influenced by the economic environment we see.
We don't try to out-guess the economic forecasters and we build plans based on consensus GDP forecast.
The consensus has actually come down slightly in the last 90 days but we certainly hope that that’s wrong and we hope the economy shows strong acceleration from here but we think we have the flexibility in our business to react to whatever environment we face.
Okay that's helpful.
In the earnings supplement there was comment that indicated U.S.
consumer travel sales declined 7% year-over-year.
The question I have is is that trend you expect to continue? Were there any signs that weather affected that? And do you generate higher fees on the consumer side than you do on business travel? You have very sharp eyes for somebody who has only had an hour or two to stare at the voluminous amount of material we put out so yes you are correct.
The consumer travel business shows a decline of about 7%.
That's actually driven by the fact that we’ve sold a small part of that business that provided the packaged vacation it was such a small transaction not particularly material so we didn't bother to call it out last year but that actually is what the loss of the revenue associated with that business or what drove the 7% decline.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
I guess just focusing on the volume trends going forward.
I mean when we think about and maybe even revenue growth when we think about the trends going forward are there any investments that you are making that might start paying their dividend sometime from second quarter onwards? And I guess broadly speaking when I look back in time it seems like that 8% target hasn't been hit for a while and I guess over the past several years if not more it is probably only been hit once.
So can you just talk about conceptually how you guys think about that revenue growth target going forward? Thanks.
Well we continue Sanjay to think that the 8% revenue target is an appropriate target on average over time and a non-average and over time economic environment.
You are quite factually correct but if you look at the last few years our revenue has -- tends to be a little bit below that level.
I would point out that despite that we have shown much better performance on the EPS side due to the flexibility of the business model I just talked about.
We certainly have an economic environment over the last year that has not gotten to the global economies or in particular the U.S.
economy’s long term average trend.
Certainly when you look at the original GDP consensus forecast for this year there is target to approach those long term averages.
It appears based on what economic data is out there so far that's probably not going to be the case the first quarter.
And that is probably reflected somewhat in our results.
But we would not in any way want to back off from the appropriateness of that 8% target and we continue to believe that as the economy returns to more normal growth rates you will see us head towards that.
The other part of your question we certainly are always balancing across our investment portfolio things that are going to help us in the near term to medium term and the long term.
And we have made a number of incremental investments and did some stepped up investing towards the latter part of last year and those are things that as you – if we follow normal patterns will help us as we get further into 2014 and beyond.
You also as I mentioned in our remarks saw us launch a few – a new product in the U.S.
market EveryDay just at the end of the last quarter.
We just re-launched Serve at the end of last year those are things that again as you get later into 2014 and beyond you will begin to see meaningful contributions.
Thank you.
Our next in queue will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura.
Please go ahead Hi thank you.
I had a question follow up on the JV thing.
I believe that your reported expenses were decreased significantly once you deconsolidate that business travel segment and started accounted for it under the equity method.
So I guess my first question is that right? And then more broadly how would that JV gain impact? How we should think about your commitment to that operating expense growth below 3% through the end of this year? Those are both very good questions Bill.
So first just may be to it sounds like you got and may be I should be making clear for everyone.
So as we execute on the joint venture transaction that will shift our accounting to the equity method which means that all you will see in our P&amp;L will be are proportionate 50% share of the joint venture's earnings each quarter.
We won't report any revenues we won't report any expenses.
So that means you will see the travel and other commissions revenue line come down significantly into that line predominant thing within that line today is our revenues from the business travel joint venture.
And then most of the expenses of business travel appear in the operating expense category.
So both of those assuming we hit our current timeline beginning in the third quarter you will no longer see the business travel amount in those rows.
We will as we get close as we get to in actual close give you the real specifics on that.
But that's the structure or the methodology if you will but everyone should keep in mind as they think about what our finance statements will look like going forward.
Okay thank you.
If I may with one follow up.
Can you talk about whether it is reasonable to expect that you are fully complete buybacks up to the full amount that was in your capital submission and then along those lines can you talk about how are you thinking about the stock at these levels? I think in the past you guys have thought about capital return as capital return haven't I believe in a so much focused on the price.
But I wanted to see if may be you could update us on the thought process.
So let me those two questions.
So certainly we are committed to the amount that the Fed did not object to in our CCAR submission.
There is a very small portion of the total each year that is a little tricky at the end because what the Fed actually approves not to get too in the details here is a net repurchase amount net of the proceeds we get from option exercises.
So as we go through the year and we get to the fourth quarter of CCAR year which is really the first quarter of the calendar year we make an estimate of what we think the option exercise is going to be that year and then we conservatively size our share repurchase in that last quarter to match that so if you did all the math you do see we grew about $60 million or so below for the fourth quarter period what was approved in our 2014 CCAR.
That's just sort of not to get into detail too much as I said.
That's the mechanics of the process we do our best to estimate what's going to happen but option exercises are not always the easiest thing to exercise.
More importantly and more broadly you are correct and we do very much remained committed to the philosophy that we believe we should have a well capitalized and strong balance sheet.
We believe we should pursue all the internal capital spending and external opportunity that we think are prudent and offer good return to our shareholders once we are done with those two things we don't believe we should sit on excess capital and so we will return capital once we have hit those first two objectives to our shareholders through a mixture of dividends and our dividend for the factoring for our profile we think is a competitive dividend and then we use share repurchase to return the remaining capital.
We think we have a tremendous track record of growth over many many years as a company.
We continue to believe we have many growth opportunities going forward.
And so we believe that is a good financial proposition for our shareholders to continue to return capital to our shareholders and we are not therefore very indifferent to modest swings in the price.
I would also just make the observation that our stock in a normal economy environment is not a particularly volatile stock.
And so just not figure greatly in our repurchase efforts I guess is the last comment I just remind you that mechanically as a public company these all kinds of constrains under which we buyback shares so practically you end up with more of an averaging in approach when you are returning a large amounts of capital that we return to our shareholders.
Thank you.
Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Please go ahead.
Good afternoon.
Question at the GNS business continues to show very strong spent growth 15% then trending is at that level but the revenue growth is only showing this quarter at 5% in that segment and I just like I mean do you think that GNS can continue to grow with those types of rates? And shouldn't revenue why is not revenue growth matching the spend growth?  Well couple of comments.
First just a mechanical comment.
Remember what you actually see in our statements is what we refer to as GNMS which is a mixture of our GNS business and the proportionate share of the little over 20 countries where we do the proprietary acquiring of the merchant portion of the economics.
So it's really the GNS growth rate are not the same as the GNMS growth rate.
All that said and we don't break the GNS growth rate out publicly separately.
All that said when you look at that GNS billings number I try to always remind people that while we are really pleased with that 15% number a portion of that high growth is driven by China.
And China as you know is a market where because of the regulatory environment; it is very difficult for any player to get a lot of economics out of the billings.
We are pleased with what we have been doing in China because we think without any capital expenditure we are building awareness in presence in brand in China that we believe we will find ways to monetize over the longer term.
But in the near term China is the market that produces a significant number o billing in our GNS business and very very little revenue.
So the GNS revenue is below that billing's number but you can't see it when you look at the GNMS number.
Okay then my second question is just on the OptBlue.
And we've heard from some contacts that product is very well received by the market and it is only handful of merchant acquirers offering it today.
But can you comment on what's your expectations are for OptBlue? Do you expect to have that in the hands of most merchant acquirers? At some point and then it does offer lower discount rate and are you comfortable with the economics and the strategic value of OptBlue as you seen operate now for a few months? Yes good question.
So the first let me start on the facts so when we first talked about this in February we talked about the fact we had six merchant acquirers on board and we have been very pleased since then to add several more and we think we are on a track to really get most of the industry on board and we are very excited about that.
It is very very early in the process.
So we all need to watch and see how this plays out in the coming quarters and couple of years but I would say all of our early experiences are positive and very reinforcing of the plans we set out at that February financial community meeting.
And you are correct that there are some trade-offs here but what we also pointed out that we are in a fact offering a sort of my term a wholesale discount rate to the acquirer.
There are also certain incentives that we have traditional paid to acquirer that go away so that helps on portion of that wholesale rate that will just show up in a different place from financial perspective but helps offset it.
Here the much more important thing is that we believe this program has the potential in the U.S.
over the next several years to make very very material dent in the coverage gap that we have in the U.S.
And we think that is very powerful for our issuing businesses and can drive incremental volumes that will make this a very positive trade off for the company and for our shareholders.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
Hi.
Just a follow-up on the topic we were just talking about.
You indicated the discount rate is a little bit lower but I'm just wondering lower than what because when we look at your all-in discount rate obviously you would skew -- I would expect to some larger merchants.
So are you suggesting the overall company discount rate is negatively impacted by this or just the like for like small merchant? Yes that's a good question Betsy.
So to be very precise my comments are really directed at the economics with the very small merchants who are part of the OptBlue program.
Now obviously any change with any merchant does affect the company's overall rate.
But it is important to realize that while in merchants that we believe we will gain through this program are very important from a coverage and a perception of coverage perspective.
In terms of the percentage of our total billing that these very small merchants generate that is very very modest portion overall of our whole billings and therefore the impact on the company's overall discount rate is changes is very much moderated by that mathematical reality if you will.
Okay and then separately you indicated earlier in the call that the US billings growth rate was negatively impacted by weather and you ended the quarter better than the first couple of weeks of the quarter.
Could you tell us what January February March was in terms of the year and your growth in billing year? Well if you will we don't like to break it out that specifically by month.
I would just stick to the comments that the second half of the quarter was certainly stronger than the first half and we haven't seen anything in the early part of April that contradicts that trend.
I'll also just make the observation that partly because of the closed loop we have a tremendous amount of information by merchant by type of merchant by industry by city by day that allows us to do quite a detailed analysis of the impact of some of the most severe weather by city by day that you saw in a country and that's what makes us quite comfortable in my commentary that there certainly was weather impact in January and February.
Okay and lastly on the expenses you indicated that there was some timing issue there and we shouldn't expect obviously to have this sub zero 4% shrinkage in OpEx on go-forward basis.
Is there anything that you have planning now to do that would be incenting incremental billings growth for Q2 and 3Q or really to get into that the kind of activity we have to wait for the closing of the global trouble business? Well I guess I would say we generally are not targeting our spend decision in terms of the benefit of spending we do quite is precisely as you just suggested by so that we know the benefits and how they're going to appear by quarter.
We generally are making investment choices that we think will help us over longer time period.
Certainly as I pointed out in my remarks as you get into Q2 you would expect to see some incremental spending in a number of areas supported by the business travel.
We did just launch the EveryDay card at the end of March so we are really just in the introduction phase of that.
The Serve product is in its very early days since we just re-launched with vastly improved functionality towards the latter part of last year.
And there are probably a few steps you will see us taking that are just another step on our journey of the coming days and ever more efficient company with a really good solid cost structure and some of the things would drive some one time charges.
So all of those things are targeted at helping us as we move into the latter part of 2014 and beyond.
But I wouldn't want to suggest that there was precise thing help us in any specific quarter.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.
Please go ahead Thanks.
I had a follow-up to Betsy and Craig' question again about the trends in the first quarter of spending.
And can you tell us the recovery in the second half of the quarter bring you back to sort of fourth quarter growth rates in the USCS or -- is there any other comments you have in terms of where the spending was weak in the first half aside from geography? Well certainly so couple of comments.
I gosh I don't want to get so specific that I am calling out specific numbers based on a few weeks.
To step back for just a second and try a little bit context I mean if you look over the last several years and our billing rates and our revenues rates you will find some modest volatility quarter-to-quarter where we go up or down a point or two and it is not necessarily indicative of a long term trend so that's why we are cautious about even now talking about within a quarter or within a couple of weeks trends that overly specific.
In terms of the specific geographies and industries I think it is all the things you would expect so if you pull out a weather database you will see specific days in Europe and Boston and Chicago in St.
Louis of extreme weather and when we look at what happened in those places you see some pretty extreme results in those cities on those days when you look at things like airline billings it is lots of lots of public commentary about the massive in fact that we record number of flights that might whole industry manage to cancel in January and February that's lost revenue to the airlines which is why they are talking a lot about how much revenue they lost frankly it is also lost business to us.
So those are the couple things I probably call out that are in these specific things we looked at.
And the travel aspect of that would be the reason you call out small business and corporate spend as opposed to consumer in the quarter? Well that certainly a logical connection I mean at some point all of that start we can't understand the psychology of everyone of our card members so at some point I want to be careful here because it gets to us making some educated judgments and we can't prove that to you but those have -- that fact pattern would appear to fit together to us.
My basic question was I just wonder if you could share any incremental thoughts about the European regulation and given that we have been through now the parliament process what is your thinking in terms of vulnerability of GNS business in Euro zone or UK? Well certainly the -- those discussions are something that we are following closely.
We are very engaged in and we spend a lot of time trying to help all of the players involved there understand the real economics and the real competitive dynamics of that market place.
Just to level set for everyone I would remind people that we are somewhere to use -- may be I use a cricket term but yeah we are in somewhere in the middle innings right because they first the commission published their draft proposal the parliament came out just a few weeks ago with their version of the recommendations the next thing is that the European Council recommendations and then there is sort of the equivalent of a conference committee in the U.S.
where they all come together.
We are very engaged and certainly there are some things we think in the regulation that are -- have the potential to have some real untended consequences and achieve results that are probably not what the regulators intended.
Those are the kinds of things we have a lot of dialogue with them amount.
All that said we do business in many many countries around the globe with many different types of regulatory regimes.
And frankly our business model varies from country to country.
So we are used to and a little experienced that dealing with evolving environment and evolving our business models.
This is the situation that is very important to us.
We are watching it very closely.
We are going to just have to see how this all plays out which we think will continue to take some time.
You don't expect final resolution this by summer or something? No not to go out on limb and guess politics but we don't.
We would say at this point and you are correct that originally they were trying to get this done by April or May that is clearly not going to happen.
Our view would be the earliest you could get to a resolution is probably much later this year and certainly could extend beyond that.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue comes from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Jeff I do understand the cricket terminology so just stop over to -- Well you'll have to educate me on what I just said.
Well I do have a couple of questions.
So first one was just to clarify the re-class of fraud losses out of provisions into operating expenses looking at I don't know if you disclose a specific number for this quarter but looked like the run rate was $70 million or so a quarter.
Is that correct? Or maybe you disclosed the actual number for this quarter and I just missed it.
Well you are correct that the run rate tends to be $70 million to $80 million a quarter.
I think we often talk about fraud on a basis point level because our fraud rate when you just look at industry data or as you know about half the industry were just for 70 to 80 is good run rate.
I don't know did we disclose a specific number more specific; it doesn't vary that much from quarter-to-quarter usually.
Okay.
That's helpful.
Then just the other question was in terms of the amexoffers.com there was the program where you can basically just go online check for offer save them to your card and be able to redeem them.
It looks like AMEX offers are basically ranked on individual relevant.
So I'm kind of curious if there was anything that from a timing perspective or technology perspective that resulted this in kind of coming together relatively recently.
I mean is this tied into your big data projects and trying to mine some of your consumer data to make more relevant offers? That was one question.
The second part of it is how big do you see this program becoming potentially? Well certainly we think that our ability to put together an offer eco system is particularly strong because of our close loop and a particular source of value both for our merchants and for our card members and of course card members value at the more we can customize for them what we offer them and of course we are getting better that every month including using your location to be very specific to what we offer you.
And we have seen growing interest on the part of merchants in using that eco system to help them drive business.
So we are I think quite excited about our ability to continue to expand our efforts in this area and our ability to use it is one of the many key tenets we have to create value across our entire network of both card members and merchants.
Okay and then I'm getting a little bit specific here but just on a different note here with your EveryDay preferred credit card you're referred to this program.
And I was looking at some of the rewards associated with the preferred card and they do seem somewhat rich depending on how you use them.
But is this a sign because I think some other card issuers also have been ramping up the rewards if you will and some of the card offer Wells Fargo is clearly indicated they want to grow their card business.
So I mean Is this a sign that we are seeing competition at this point now that is going to eventually just reduce the profitability the products across the board or do you see these are just very specific to certain target demographic and so as a result of that we shouldn't read into this more broadly that there will be rational competition? Well certainly I guess I made the couple of points.
One remember that our goal is to engage our card members in the reward program because that is really how we generate the most loyalty the most spend and the best bottom line result.
So feel an irony here is as a general statement it can be a very positive thing for us when our rewards expand goes up.
We've also done a lot of work over the last years and you continue to see as every quarter really expand the range of redemption offers because people have lots of different preferences and lots of different likes and dislikes and we have found great receptivity amongst our card members to that growing range of offers which I think someone may trying to do the kind of comparison you just described.
A little trickier because you don't necessarily know the redemption pattern and some ways you can look at our rewards cost each quarter.
And that does give you a macro view of how it is trending relative to billings.
On EveryDay preferred clearly we think we have a proposition here that is going to be very attractive to a segment of the market that fits our long standing risk profile that we are after but frankly a segment of the market we probably didn't have the right product for it.
And certainly offering the right product to that demographic has to include having a competitive set of rewards but I guess I will be a little cautious about extrapolating from that one data point anything overly broad about rewards in general.
I think operator we probably have time for one last question.
Thank you.
Our question will come from Daniel Furtado with Jefferies.
Please go ahead Great.
Thank you for the opportunity here.
Earlier in the prepared remarks you said you were working on products that are more welcoming and more inclusive.
And focusing on new customer segments.
The way a layman should read this is simply that you're looking to move slightly down the credit spectrum as the economy has improved or how should we read those comments? Well I don't if I used focus on the word credit.
I like to think as I said if you look at this company over the last 30-40 years we started out with a credit card with target our charge card that was targeted in a very very small group of customers who travel a lot in State at certain types of hotel.
And there has been a steady evolution over decade of us moving beyond that initial very narrow customer demographic moving beyond the very narrow merchant demographic and moving towards EveryDay spend moving towards the broader customer base we added lend products etcetera.
And so when we look at things like the EveryDay card the prepaid products and the OptBlue program to expand merchant coverage all of those things to us a part of long running trend in this company to extend the franchise and the brand which we think is so powerful.
But that doesn't mean that we are changing the risk profile or the credit profile of the company.
We think it means having the right product for different parts of the market.
And matching that with ways that we provide value and merchant.
So I -- yes we feel real opportunity here to continue to expand the footprint of our brand but this is not about changing our risk profile.
For the EveryDay card this is for people who already would have qualified for other products.
And frankly we didn't really have a product that they thought was relevant for them.
That's what we are trying to do.
Okay great.
Thank you for the opportunity.
That was my only question.
So thank you all for your time and your interest in American Express.
Have a good evening.
Thank you.
And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference call for today.
We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference.
You may now disconnect.
[Starts in Progress] (Operator instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead.
Thank you and welcome everybody.
Thanks for joining us for today’s call.
Today’s discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company’s other reports already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2014 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed.
All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter’s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed.
Once Jeff completes his remarks we will move to a Q&amp;A session.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.
Well thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone.
I’m pleased to be on the call this afternoon to discuss another good quarterly performance by American Express.
As you know we are holding this call a little later than usual this quarter due to the complexity of the Business Travel joint venture transaction which closed on the last day of the second quarter.
The gain resulting from the creation of the joint venture and the related incremental investments impacted our reported results across a number of P&amp;L lines this quarter.
We’ll walk you through these impacts in just a few minutes to provide a better understanding of our underlying performance.
Overall we are pleased with this quarter’s performance as the momentum seen at the end of the first quarter continued into Q2.
We believe that our underlying operating performance continues to demonstrate the strength and flexibility of our business model and you will recognize some familiar themes in the quarter including higher spending by our card members modest growth in the long portfolio credit indicators at or near historical lows disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends over the past year.
You will also see some significant and largely offsetting items related to our Business Travel joint venture.
I’ll come back to each of the moving pieces in a moment but our bottom line came to $1.43 earnings per share on a fully diluted basis.
To begin I’ll read the financial results for Q2.
As you can see on Slide 2 card members spending build business growth up 9% on both the reported and FX adjusted basis year-over-year.
These growth rates represent a modest acceleration versus Q1 with the improvement seen predominantly in the U.S.
While volume improved 3 points overall versus last quarter we saw a smaller increase in reported revenue growth which increased to 5% during the current quarter from 4% in Q1.
I’ll discuss the drivers of revenue growth in a few minutes.
Pre-tax income rose 16% during the quarter while net income grew 9%.
This net income growth rate was lower than the 16% growth in the pre-tax income due to the unusually low tax rate we benefited from during the second quarter of last year.
Over the last four quarters we have repurchased $3.9 billion of common shares.
That translated into a 4% decrease in average shares outstanding versus the prior year.
This then helped to drive diluted EPS to the $1.43 I mentioned a moment ago which was 13% higher than the prior on a reported basis.
These results also brought our ROE for the period ending June 30th to 29% above our on average and overtime target of 25%.
So now to provide context for these overall results let’s review the gain from the creation of the Business Travel joint venture and the related incremental investments.
As a reminder American Express and an outside investor group each have a 50% ownership interest in the new joint venture.
Our partners invested $900 million of cash into the joint venture while we contributed the assets of our Business Travel operations.
We will continue to have a close working relationship with the joint venture.
We believe that the additional resources provided by the new investor group will supports to develop products create capabilities and attract new customers.
On Slide 3 you can see that the closing of the joint venture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $626 million in line with the estimates we provided you earlier this year.
We incurred associated transaction related cost of $79 million.
And I would note that we will incur a modest amount of transaction related cost in the next several quarters.
As we first began to discuss at the beginning of this year we used a substantial portion of the gain to fund incremental initiatives to better position the company for the future.
First the gain gave us the flexibility to absorb $133 million in restricting costs as we continue to focus on further increasing the overall efficiency of our organization in line with the evolving nature of our customer and business needs.
Second we made an incremental contribution of $40 million to the AXP Foundation to support our future philanthropic activities.
Last and most significantly we step upped our investments in support of many growth initiatives.
There’s obviously some subjectivity involved in determining just what was incremental.
As you can see on the slide it was a significant amount.
These investments were primarily in marketing and promotion although there were smaller amounts in a number of other P&amp;L lines including operating expenses.
These investments primarily consisted of media spending to support some of our newer products such as Amex EveryDay and Serve in the U.S.
as well as incremental customer acquisition activities around the world.
I’ll provide more detail when we review our quarterly expense performance in a few minutes.
Overall we estimate that the total impact of the Business Travel joint venture this quarter after netting out all of these items was a small net benefit of approximately $0.05 to quarterly EPS.
Let’s turn now to a more detailed look at several trends that will give you a better sense of the quarter starting with billed business on Slide 4.
Total company billings growth increased from 6% in Q1 to 9% on Q2 on a reported basis and from 7% to 9% on an FX adjusted basis.
Moving to Slide 5 which shows the billing trends by region you can see that the accelerated growth was seen predominantly in the U.S.
for our consumer small business and corporate volumes all accelerated from the lower levels we saw in the first quarter.
As you might remember we mentioned that U.S.
billings growth improved during the second half of Q1 and we saw that momentum continue during the second quarter.
Overall international billings growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter declining slightly to 9% in Q2 versus 10% in Q 1 on an FX adjusted basis.
We did see a decline in growth rates in the JAPA region driven primarily by slower growth in China as we laughed at the rollout of new partners and products by our GNS partners during the prior year.
We also saw slower growth in Australia consistent with an overall slowdown in industry credit card volumes seen in the country during Q2.
Turning to build business by segment on Slide 6 you can see that the moderation in volume growth in China and Australia also had an impact on GNS performance during the quarter.
Our GNS remained our fastest growth segment in terms of billings up 13% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis.
Moving on to loans the second key revenue driver.
We see on Slide 7 that loan balances grew 5% globally.
U.S.
loans were up 6% from a year ago and continue to outpace the industry.
Both of these growth rates improved by 200 basis points versus the prior quarter.
It’s probably worth noting that our loan growth continues to come primarily from greater spending by our card members and is not due to any significant change in our underwriting strategy.
I’ll also note that the new EveryDay product has performed well relative to our expectation since its launch a few months ago.
But it is of course far too early for the product to have any meaningful impact on our overall levels of loan growth.
Putting it all together then our billings and loan performance helped drive total revenue growth of 5% on both the reported and FX adjusted basis as you can see on Slide 8.
Consistent with prior periods this growth was primarily driven by greater discount revenue from higher build business volumes.
During the quarter discount revenue growth did not accelerate as fast as billings grow due primarily to a 4 basis point year-over-year in the reported discount rate.
Now on this point I would remind you that in any given quarter the year-over-year discount variants can be influenced in part by the timing of certain items.
This can lead to some volatility in the variants from quarter to quarter.
For example as you will recall our discount rate was flat year-over-year during Q1 before being down 4 basis points this quarter.
On a year-to-date basis therefore the discount rate is down 2 basis points which is roughly in line with our expectations.
Moving on from discount revenue the other primary driver of revenue growth was a 9% increase in net interest income.
As we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding cost and an increase in average flow of balances.
Turning now to provision.
You can see on Slide 9 that our credit metrics are near or at historical low levels.
Worldwide lending write-off in delinquency rates decreased in the quarter with our delinquency rate reaching an all-time low at 1%.
As we’ve said previously our goal is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best returns on our portfolio.
Therefore we would continue to expect that lending write-off rates will increase somewhat from these low levels at some point.
Slide 10 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels.
Overall our coverage levels remain relatively consistent with the prior quarter and we believe are appropriate given the risk level inherent to the portfolio.
Finally as you can see on Slide 11 provision was down 6% versus the prior year reflecting lower lending write-offs in the current period.
Charge card provision increased by 14% driven by a larger reserve release in the prior year.
While the charge card delinquency rate declined versus Q1 during both years we saw a larger sequential decline last year.
Turning now to expenses on Slide 12 total reported expenses increased by 2%.
In understanding this increase it’s important to note that both marketing and promotion and operating expenses were significantly impacted by the Business Travel joint venture game and related incremental initiatives.
Turning to marketing and promotion first the vast majority of the incremental costs encourage to support our growth initiatives or within marketing and promotion driving a 25% year-over-year in this line.
There were some incremental costs that hit other lines.
Second as you can see operating expenses were down 8% on a reported basis primarily as a result of the gain from the Business Travel joint venture which was recognized as an expense for adoption.
On the operating expense line this gain was partially offset by transaction related costs the restructuring charge and the incremental contribution to the AXP Foundation.
Turning to rewards expense we saw an 11% increase relatively in line with reported billings growth.
Finally the tax rate in the quarter was 33.9% which was significantly higher than the unusually low 29.6% tax rate that we experienced during the second quarter of 2013.
This quarter’s 33.9% was in line with our prior expectations though that our tax rate could be closer to the mid-30s.
To provide more context now on marketing and promotion expenses which include the majority of the investments to grow our business Slide 13 shows that these expenses were at $985 million this quarter.
We continue to believe that we have a number of attractive investment opportunities across our core business and from newer initiatives.
The gain from the Business Travel joint venture transaction this quarter provided the opportunity to increase our investments in some of our growth initiatives and better position the company for the future.
The incremental investments included some media spending you may have seen in the U.S.
to support the launch of the Amex EveryDay card and the relaunch of Serve.
We also included some less visible investments including incremental card acquisition activities across the U.S.
and international partners.
During Q2 we also made progress on other important strategic initiatives including our OptBlue program with small merchant coverage.
During the current quarter we announced that four new merchant acquirers were added to OptBlue including First Data.
And we continue to add new partners to the program.
We also continue to be at the forefront of connecting consumers and merchants in new and innovative ways through digital capabilities.
Our recent partnership with Uber which creates an elegant seamless experience for U.S.
card members to earn or redeem membership rewards points within the Uber mobile app is the latest example of how we are leverage unique technology to create value for merchants and consumers.
While it is still early days for many of our digital initiatives we are excited about the new capabilities we are developing in this space.
Moving to operating expenses now on Slide 14 let me provide a bit more detail about the impact for the Business Travel joint venture.
On a reported basis total operating expenses decreased by 8% versus the prior year during the quarter.
They were heavily impacted by the Business Travel joint venture transaction and related items including the gain which is recorded in other net expense the restricting charge and the incremental charitable contribution.
After taking into account these impacts adjusted operating expenses increased by 4% versus the prior year.
The higher adjusted growth rate compared to earlier this year is due to a number of smaller items.
I’d also remind you that we are now growing over the second quarter of last year which did experience the lowest levels of operating of any quarter during 2013.
Let’s turn now to the efficiency initiatives which drove the $133 million restructuring charge this quarter.
The actions we are taking here are primarily related to positions that do not directly impact revenue including some actions that will be taking place over the next year.
These initiatives are designed to improve our efficiency better align us with changing customer preferences and behaviors and contain operating expenses moving forward.
More broadly I would also remind you that going forward Business Travel revenues and costs will no longer be embedded in our financial results.
We will report only our share of the joint ventures earnings as we will account for it using the equity method.
To help you with modeling this Business Travel cost constituted approximately 11% of our total operating expenses during full year 2013.
On the revenue side Business Travel revenues constituted approximately 80% of our total travel commissions and fees during full year 2013.
To conclude now with operating expenses on Slide 15 on a year-to-date basis operating expenses remain well-controlled.
After taking into account the specific items this quarter adjusted operating expenses were flat versus the prior year.
We remain committed to our annual target to have the operating expenses grow by less than 3% during 2014.
We will adjust our target for the balance of the year to account for the Business Travel operating expenses that will no longer be reflected in our P&amp;L.
Now let’s turn to capital the substantial amount of new capital we generate provides us with significant degrees of flexibility as shown on Slide 16.
This quarter we were able to return 87% of capital to shareholders while also maintaining our strong ratios.
As you can see on Slide 17 we have also improved the diversity of our funding sources by building a significantly larger deposit base over the last several years.
Our funding mixture in Q2 was consistent with the prior year.
And we believe that the mix should be relatively stable going forward.
Let me now turn to one more topic before I conclude and take your questions.
As you are aware our trial with the DOJ began earlier this month.
The government is currently presenting their case.
We will then present our defense and call witnesses on behalf of American Express.
The trial is expected to end later this quarter and will be followed by the issuance of a decision which could take several months or longer to complete.
There will then likely be a lengthy appeals process.
As much as we might like to I don’t think it’s appropriate or beneficial to offer colored commentary on any of the specific testimony.
We will make our argument were it matters in the court room.
We believe that our legal defense is strong but ultimately it will be up to the courts to decide.
To remind everyone of the context we decided to fight for three key reasons.
First it is unfair to allow merchants who have agreed to honor our cards to then discriminate against American Express and our card members.
Second it is fundamentally unfair to interfere with the consumer’s right to choose how they want to pay at the checkout counter.
And third the result of Justice Departments seeks would provide no benefit to consumers.
Instead it would weaken competition.
So to summarize now on the quarter while there are some complexity in our reported results this quarter from the gain related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and our incremental initiatives we feel good about our underlying performance during the quarter.
Reported EPS was up 13% versus the prior year driven by accelerated billings and loan growth write-off rates that remain at historical lows disciplined control of our operating expenses and our strong capital position.
Looking forward we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders.
With that I’ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate.
Operator?  Certainly.
(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup.
Please go ahead.
Hi good evening.
Jeff I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on loan growth obviously a little bit of an uptick this quarter.
We’re seeing a similar trend with some of the other issuers.
Can you put into some context? Are you seeing a little bit better demand? Or is this something that is more onetime issue? Well it’s good and an important question.
And certainly we have been pleased over the last number of quarters to see loan growth in the 3% to 4% range at a time when the industry numbers were flattish to in some quarter down a little bit.
And when you look at that growth over the last year so it really has been driven by spending of our card members.
And as we look at the sequential acceleration from 4% to 6% this quarter we still see it pretty much just driven by spend levels of our card members that certainly one can speculate goes along with just continued levels or growth and levels of confidence about the economy.
So there’s certainly nothing unusual in terms of timing or accounting or any of those items.
I mean we think that the sequential pickup in growth rates is very solid and assuming the economic environment stays the same we would hope that it continues at that trend.
I think the other thing I really do want to emphasize that I mentioned that I mentioned in the earlier remarks is it just increased spend that has driven the loan growth.
We are very focused and very comfortable with our current risk profile and so you haven’t seen us make any significant changes in the various decisions we’re making around risk.
Thanks.
Okay thank you.
And the next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson.
Please go ahead.
Thanks.
I just wanted to follow up on some of the spending trends understanding everything that you’ve gone through in great detail about how the sale of the – or the formation of the JV influencing the spending trends in the period.
How should we contemplate some of these line items going forward particularly of course the marketing and promotion line and as well as the salaries and employee benefits line as a consequence of some of the restructuring actions you’ve undertaken? So I’d probably break that into two parts Eric.
On things like marketing and promotion as we’ve said for a couple of quarters now we clearly saw the opportunity with the business travel gain to increase spending levels this quarter but I would expect to see them go back towards what I would call more normal or normalized levels beginning next quarter.
There’s some seasonality in that and you see that seasonality quite clearly in the chart on Slide 13 but that’s what I would expect to see next quarter on the marketing and promotion side.
In terms of the restructuring charge that we took you are quite correct in that that will drive some economies for us in the coming quarters.
However you can imagine that given the size of the charge there is some complexity to the changes that we will be making and so it will take us into 2015 before you will see the economic benefit on the operating expense side of the restructuring charge we took and the changes that it will facilitate us making to our operation over the course of the next year or so.
Okay great.
And if I could just also follow up I think in the footnotes it mentioned that you took a charge for a change in the membership rewards alternate redemption rate and is that distinct from the restructuring charges that you called out and if so can you give us a sense of the magnitude of that figure? Yes it’s completely distinct from anything we called out.
And the way I would think about this Eric is you have seen us over the last couple of years make a couple of all-related incremental improvements in the methodology we use for estimating this liability.
This was one of the last remaining pieces of that change.
We made earlier changes in the more material markets.
And so that’s why this was smaller charge but it was still significant enough to call out for you that I believe now brings us globally to where we have adopted a new and we believe a better methodology for how we calculate URR around the globe.
But that is all completely separate from the discussion we had around the incremental investments we chose to affirmatively make in the quarter to help grow the business.
And the magnitude? The magnitude it’s probably worth a couple of pennies.
All right.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
Thank you.
Next question from the line of Vincent Kentek [ph] of Macquarie.
Please go ahead.
Yes thank you.
Just one quick question and one more follow up question.
On the spend growth this quarter it’s very very strong.
I was wondering if you could kind of guide us on to whether to expect that spend growth for the rest of 2014 or if we should be kind of thinking about the first half of ‘14 as the loan growth.
And then kind of on the incremental growth initiatives investments made this quarter and understanding it’s early days but when should we be thinking about say the revenue opportunities that come from those investments? Thank you.
Well on spend growth going forward boy we are always really cautious about trying to project forward because as you know it’s in our – results are tied to a number of things but including what happens economically.
And I would say as we look at the June 4% to 9% billing growth rate we are reasonably pleased with that number given the fact that the economy is with the very very big slow down that we saw in Q1.
When you look at Q2 and you look at year-over-year growth in the economy and I’d remind everyone that’s really what our year-over-year billings growth is more correlated to and not necessarily the sequential trend in GDP but the year-over-year trend.
The latest forecast that I look at for the June quarter and we’ll all see the numbers in the coming weeks make an estimate that the year-over-year growth in GDP is probably down in the 1.2% to 2% range.
So when it’s given – if that in fact turns out to be the case they have 9% billings growth it’s actually something we’re fairly pleased with.
Obviously what happens going forward is going to be heavily impacted by what happens to that year-over-year economic growth number particularly in the US economy which is still the largest chunk of our billing so we’ll have to – have to see where that plays out.
I would just make the observation that as we’ve looked at our June quarter results and billings trend there’s nothing particularly unusual or one time oriented to two of those numbers.
I think they’re reflective of the core underlying run rate of the business in that quarter in the economic environment.
In terms of when the incremental investments pay off as we always do and we think about investments we invest in a range of things that have payoffs from very short to medium term to a few things that have very long-term payoffs.
When you look at the restructuring charges there is a very detailed set of plans for the changes we will make and when we will get the benefits and they will be mostly fully played out or mostly in place by the time you get out 12 months from now.
If you look at the spend on growth initiatives when you think about things like the EveryDay Card launch and our card acquisition efforts those will begin to show more of an impact as you get in to the second third fourth quarters from when we make those investments.
The one long-term thing we did is as we’ve said for quite some time on Serve that is a long-term proposition for us that we believe in.
And this is the first time we’ve ever really done any media on Serve and I’d remind you that that is an area where we really are trying to in some ways create a new category and we have to help our customers understand how to use that product and how it can really help make their financial life better.
That’s a longer-term prospect.
So that’s how I would think about the range of investments from close-in to medium term to longer term.
Great.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
Thank you.
And the next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I don’t want to ask about anything relating specifically to the DOJ case but I had a broad question surrounding the notion of market power.
One of the key points in prior cases involving AMX is that I don’t believe you guys have ever been found to have market power.
And that’s been a key reason why you’ve been able to avoid direct regulation in places like Australia.
But as we look ahead at the investments that you continue to make in the business the share gains that you’ve enjoyed since the Great Recession and the anticipated continued growth that should continue as we look ahead how do you think about the risk that it could just be a matter time before you’re viewed as having market power? And I guess is market power simply an outcome and you’ll deal with it if and when the time comes that you’re found to have it or is it something that you don’t anticipate becoming an issue anytime soon because your biggest network competitors have so much more share than you? Maybe if you can just speak broadly to that notion of market power that’d be great.
I’ll – though I will make just a few very brief comments.
Of course just to be clear as you stated there is no finding anywhere that we have market power around the globe.
Two we work really hard every day because of the unique nature of our closed-loop network to demonstrate the value we provide to the merchants and the value we provide to our card members and none of whom has to have our product or have acceptance of our product and we work at that every single day.
Third I would just make the factual statement that once you leave the US market our market shares are very very small in other countries around the globe.
So I think given as you prefaced your question with the tendency of the DOJ trial though I probably should limit my comments to those but these are all issues we of course feel very strongly about.
I appreciate that completely and understand.
Maybe as a follow up unrelated.
Can you discuss the rationale underlying the Serve initiative at Wal-Mart? I guess I was a little bit confused by just from a high level I thought that the strategy was that the Bluebird product was going to be kind of the primary platform used at Wal-Mart but that Serve would kind of be used elsewhere but it sounds like Serve and Bluebird are both available at Wal-Mart.
Maybe you could speak to that? Well I guess I’d make a couple of comments.
If you draw an analogy to our card or credit business we have many different products in all of the countries around the globe in which we do business because they all serve different target segments and we think there is tremendous value in having the right card for the right customer.
And so I think Wal-Mart as they think about what they want to offer to their customers similarly believes that there should be a range of choices and that different products will provide different sets of capabilities and features to customers and that choice is a good thing.
And so we’re both – our philosophy and Wal-Mart’s philosophy are quite aligned on this.
To us it seems very natural to put in the end the consumer in the drive seat so that they can make a choice.
Thanks very much.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
And the next question is from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.
Please go ahead.
Yes thanks.
My main question is around expenses.
There’s a lot of moving parts here.
And the first part of it relates to the salaries expense.
I think Eric asked about this but I didn’t hear a response to it.
I think you indicated in the supplements that salaries were increased 7% year-over-year predominantly due to restructuring charges.
Were those for the recurring severance-related expenses or are those investments that’ll lead to a continued kind of year-over-year increase in salaries? I mean just the second part of that is your broader 3% – sub 3% annual year-over-year growth target.
I think you indicated Jeff that you’re now kind of lapping some of the best quarters from expense reductions and you’re now kind of growing off of that.
Should we expect some operating expense growth in the back half of the year? So let me take those one at a time.
And Mark your question makes – I think perhaps we weren’t as clear as we should have been.
So when you think about the $133 million restructuring charge that we took that amount will appear in the salaries and benefits line predominantly.
There’s a very small piece that relates to some facilities but most of that charge is for a number of cases around the globe where we will be making changes to our operation and it is for severance for several thousand people as we make those changes and get the right people with the right skill sets and the right places to provide great service for our customers.
So that’s what drove the salaries and benefits line up this quarter.
And that’s where as you go out over the course of the next four quarters and we execute on these plans you will see the savings or benefits if you will of those restructuring in the salaries and benefit line.
So hopefully that clarifies that point.
In terms of operating expense you did see a particular low point in last year’s second quarter and so that’s the only point I was making when I noted that I think in the first quarter our operating expenses were actually down a little bit year-over-year whereas this quarter they were up 4%.
We are very committed and I think have demonstrated a really good track record of controlling operating expenses.
So there is no particular plan in place to sequentially begin to grow operating expenses again as we go in to the back half of the year.
We remain very committed to hitting that less than 3% target for the full year.
Okay.
Great.
And then just one other question if I could.
Could you give us some color on where your pipeline is for potential new GNS partnerships? Is there enough there where you think you might be able to sustain kind of a low-to-mid teens year-over-year growth and billings that you had there? Well I think – I certainly don’t want to comment on specifics of partnership discussions we may be involved in.
But I think the more important point is that when you look at the growth that we have consistently shown in GNS that growth is not necessarily drive by the steady addition of new partners.
It’s driven by the fact that we have a lot of great existing partners who in fact operate in some of the higher growth markets around the globe and/or operate in certain markets like China where our presence is still in – I would call it it’s earlier stages in therefore much higher growth.
And so the sustainability of that higher growth level well one element that help support it is signing new partners; far more important really is the performance of the partners we have around the globe and we feel very good about that performance and about the continue opportunities for growth.
Got it.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
And the next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce of Bank of America.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Good evening.
My question really relates to the incremental growth initiatives and thank you for providing a little bit of color in terms of how you’re using those investments or how you’re making those investments.
And I think one of the challenges that investors have in terms of some of these gains historically that have been used to support growth is that it’s very difficult to really understand where the tangible benefits ultimately are going to come from.
And maybe there is a way to help us dimensionalize how we should be thinking about where this is going to materialize whether it would in terms of just average spending growth or if you think that ultimately it’s going to drive cards enforced growth first and ultimately will begin to work its way in to the billings patterns and what the real kind of timeline we should be expecting these initiatives to ultimately pay us back.
And I recognize that you make a series of investments and I’ve – you kind of understand from historical discussion but anything given this large nature of spend in this quarter would be very helpful.
Well that’s a – Ken a fair and very important question.
I’d make a couple of comments.
Certainly we have detailed works and analysis we do here to determine how to prioritize the spending we do on growth initiatives.
Let me talk about the efficiency initiatives separately in just a second.
And so on those growth initiatives we continue to believe even in the quarter we just finished that as we look at our acquisition efforts we actually still have more ROI-positive opportunities than we are able to fund while still meeting our earnings targets.
We clearly could go further this quarter but all of those initiatives are closely tracked.
We have a quite analytical understanding of what happens as we do various kinds of acquisition activities around the globe and feel very good about the payoff that will come on those investments.
I would note however that the incremental spend in the context of the overall size of our company and the overall size of spending we do is fairly modest.
So this did not double our spending for the quarter or for the year.
It’s a much – if you think about this on an annual basis this is adding 5% or 10% to our spend.
So you will clearly see it in growth in revenues over time; practically it is hard to break that out of the consolidated level.
At a very detailed level we will be tracking it very closely.
When you look at the media spend on the EveryDay Card which is the largest chunk of the media spend which should be fairly obvious if you watch TV hopefully that is harder to measure.
On the other hand we have a very clear way to measure the success and growth of the EveryDay Card and we’ll see that we believe and hope grow to be a very sizeable and profitable product for us in the coming quarters and years.
So that’s the revenue side of the equation on the efficiency initiatives a very clear pathway to getting far more benefit than what you would need to justify the restructuring charge and we will begin to see those benefits fully phased in as you get in to 2015.
Again the challenge and you’re seeing them from the outside and the P&amp;L is one of scale; when you think about the overall magnitude of our expense base we do lots and lots of things everyday to continually find ways to be more efficient so that we can achieve the kind of control of our operating expenses that you’ve seen us achieve over the last couple of years.
This is a piece of that.
And you should see it in continued strong performance on the operating expense line.
So I realize that may not be as specific to these initiatives and I will make a note here and we should think a little bit about how we in future quarters try to take some of our own ability at more of a micro level to think about how these initiative is doing and give you a little bit of color into them Oh thanks.
That would be appreciated.
One follow up fine tuning or maybe two fine tuning questions.
There is a reference to a Community Reinvestment Act portfolio fair value adjustment or valuation adjustment.
I assume that was an impairment; can you give us what the size of that was if it was material? And then secondarily if there is any way to give us some sense as to how the Wells Fargo roll out is going? Well let me take those maybe in reverse order.
So Wells Fargo we’re certainly very pleased with our broader relationship with Wells Fargo and it’s a growing relationship.
But it’s very early days in terms of the GNS launch.
What I would say is we certainly are pleased though to see some of the comments that John Stumpf made just a few weeks ago about the partnership and gosh rather than me commenting on it I love the fact that John came out and said they’re very pleased and see the partnership with us as being off to a very very good start.
So I supposed he’s a better judge in some ways that we are.
And so we’re thrilled to see that.
On the Community Reinvestment Act as with many accounting issues we are constantly ensuring that we have the best methodologies for estimation and this is one where we have a revised approach to how we estimate what we should be booking and that’s what we switched to this quarter and it did drive an incremental expense amount that you see called out in the release as we made today.
Great.
Thank you for your comments.
Okay.
Thank you.
And the next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
I got a couple of questions.
One on the revenue yields.
When we think about the net interest yield going forward that cropped pretty significantly sequentially.
I’m not sure if that was seasonal or something but how should we think about its progression going forward.
Same thing with the discount rate I know you addressed it but maybe you could just talk about the migration going forward will there be stability in that discount rate going forward.
And then second question is around the $0.05 gain that you guys recognized this quarter; when we think about how you guys assess yourselves relative to your targets I assume that will be inclusive of that $0.05.
Thank you.
So a couple of comments and I’ll take those one at a time.
First on the net interest yield you are actually correct Sanjay in one of your comments which is there is some seasonality.
And if you go back and look at the slides we have you actually see that year-over-year the net interest yield is up a little bit.
And that of course is predominantly driven by the continued steady averaging down of our interest expense rates give the rate environment.
And so there is no – in terms of the sequential trend I wouldn’t focus on that.
I’d stay more focused on the year-over-year trends.
On the discount rate as I said in my remarks we had a number of timing items that actually impacted both the first quarter making the first quarter essentially flat year-over-year and in essence some things that would have caused it to go down a little bit in the first quarter slipped into the second quarter and you saw a 4 basis point decline.
More broadly we said for a number of years that you should expect to see discount rate decline 2 to 3 basis points a year and that’s because of our continued focus on driving more EveryDay spend.
It’s a function of location.
It’s a function of our merchants growing and hitting volume-based triggers steadily over time.
It’s a function of a very competitive environment and it’s a function of evolving mix.
So all of those things those are the long terms trends that have been in place for many many years and you can look at the trend over the last five six years and see how we’ve done historically based of all of those trends and managing the discount rate.
So when you look at the year to date numbers we’re pretty much in line with the trend.
You just have to take that noise out of having the first quarter look unusually good year-over-year and the second quarter look unusually bad.
That’s first.
And the second comment I think your third question was how we think about the $0.05 of EPS is that – Yes that’s right.
When we think about the targets that you guys have outlined in terms of long-term targets will that $0.05 be included in that? Well of course we never provide guidance.
We’re very public about our long-term targets being out there at 12% to 15%.
And our goal Sanjay is to drive our earnings in the second half as much as we can.
What I would say is that you heard me mention in my earlier remarks that there are some transaction-related costs that are going to lag into the third and fourth quarter.
And so as we think about the full year the incremental cost that are going to lag into the back half of the year are going to offset some portion still to be determined precisely of that $0.05.
So yeah I guess as we think about the full year we are likely to think about the $1.43 because the full year impact of all the elements of the JV are likely to be more of a watch.
All right.
I got it.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
The next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead.
Great.
Thanks.
I guess the first question I had was the – it seems like if you take the gain and you x out the kind of one-time items you have about $300 million left that you reinvested and it also seems like starting in Q3 you’ll have roughly $200 million less in revenue from the travel joint venture from the accounting for the travel joint venture.
So how long do you think it would take before those $300 million of extra investments were able to replace kind of that $200 million revenue? Well remember Moshe we also lose $200 million of expense relating to travel business.
Right.
Quite well – Just thinking about the revenue growth.
Yes yes.
Right.
So when you think about the kind of things we’re investing in as you get into as I said earlier quarters two through six is when you should really see the card-related spend on EveryDay and the acquisition efforts begin to have a material impact.
Now of course our bottom line goal here is to drive earnings for the company not necessarily to a dollar-for-dollar replace the revenue – Sure.
– of the travel business but that’s probably the framework I would use for thinking about it.
Right.
And the second – the kind of the follow a couple of people have talked about the discount rate.
You mentioned just some of the components I thought that also cash back rewards is netted out of the discount merchant discount and has that been factor? Because that’s been area in which cash back rewards has kind of grown as an industry issue.
Could you talk about that a little bit? Yes so it’s probably worth clarifying Moshe exactly what’s in what number.
So the discount rate that we provide is a calculated discount rate meant to represent what we get for economics from merchants where we are acquirer.
And so that calculation which we do and then report out on every quarter is the one that went down 4 basis points this quarter.
There are other people who do a very simple calculation.
They look at our GAAP financial statement and they divide discount revenue into billings and that gives you a discount rate that is significantly lower.
And neither of those things is reflective of the economics we’re getting at the merchants which is why we pull them out of our calculated number.
But it is why you see growth in the different between our calculated discount rate that we report and the simple calculation that you get when you divide up the GAAP income statement discount revenue into billings.
All that said you are correct that cash back products have been very strong products for us and that’s a very good thing.
It does drive up cash back rewards cost at a little higher rate than revenue growth.
And since account [ph] to revenue it has the effect I just described.
So hopefully that clarifies for you the way these pieces fit together.
Mostly though because – but you had said that the – I thought you had said that your discount rate included some of the payments to merchants for the contract signings and now you just said that some of those are not included.
No it’s not – I didn’t mean to say that.
I don’t – so what’s not included in our calculated discount rate to come back to it is the economics we have with GNS partners which we pull out and the cash back rewards cost and the client incentives.
There’s a few other very very small things but those are the large timings [ph].
With merchant signing an example would be that we’re constantly every day out there competing for the business of our merchants.
And as we’ve – particularly with some of the larger merchants and in any B2B negotiations sometimes you might have a contract that expires in one quarter but you don’t get around to actually finishing the renegotiation until the next quarter.
You’ll make the contract retroactive to the prior quarter when the prior contract expired.
That would be an example of where you’re going to get a timing impact as you look at the discount rate quarter to quarter that’s not reflective of the ongoing rate.
Got it.
Thanks.
Okay.
Thank you.
And the next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
And I beat a dead horse I guess on the incremental growth initiatives.
It’s a little confusing as to – you have so many opportunities why would you spend it all in the incremental cost in one quarter? I mean are you under-investing versus your opportunities overall and so therefore – I mean you have more – you should be driving more expense through the year and forget about this year’s earnings growth target to drive long-term value for investors or should have that investment – why wouldn’t you have any spread of that – spread that over a couple of different quarters to support growth.
So I’m just a little confused by why – Yes.
– all those incremental investments are in this quarter.
And if you have so many additional positive ROI growth initiatives why are you not spending more longer – not only this quarter but the next several quarters? Oh boy those are great questions Bob.
Let me take it in two parts.
If you think about over the medium to long term how we manage the company we’re trying to balance lots of different things.
We’re trying to balance achieving these steady consistent financial performance that I think all of our shareholders have come to expect from us with a reality of the competitive world we live in that makes it challenging to get to our near-term financial targets with the need to investment for the medium and long term and make sure we’re positioning this company to be a successful five years from as it will be next quarter.
So as we try to balance all of those things you are correct that one of the things we are trying to maximize is making sure we achieve that steady financial performance.
And that does force us to prioritize how we make investment choices and when we make those investments.
And it does cost us at times to defer going down the path on certain growth initiatives to a future date because we think that’s the right balance between that steady financial performance short-term investments and longer-term investments.
That’s the longer-term view.
If you think about this quarter I guess what I would point out is in many ways you had a confluence here of the reality that we have been on in a reengineering journey for several years and it was very logical for us to take the moves that drove the restructuring charge this quarter.
We’ll actually enact those over the course of the next year but we think it just made sense to pair it up with the gain.
Similarly it just was a nice coincidence that we launched the EveryDay Card at the end of March and early April so it coincided very nicely to do a big blitz of spend on Everyday right at the time of the second quarter.
Again somewhat similarly we just re-launched Serve late last year and felt this was a good time to do the first ever really media blitz.
Lastly I just remind you the business travel transaction is one we have been working on for a very long time.
We knew well in advance the timing of when it was likely to happen.
And that really allowed us to be thoughtful and planful in all of our marketing and operational plans this year to take advantage of the timing.
So we don’t we suboptimized how we used that gain.
We actually think that it allows us to – in a very planful way do a lot of things that we have had on our plate for awhile and will pay off for our shareholders in the coming quarters.
Great.
And just a follow-up question – thank you for that – is on the travel joint venture is there a new strategy that’s being embarked upon and I mean you still have the $1 billion – nearly $1 billion of value in that business and it is still I think important to American Express is there a new acceleration of growth strategy? I mean is it looking to compete in a different area of travel to – I mean is it the idea here to accelerate growth and then how does American Express still benefit from that business? Boy to be very clear we created this joint venture because we are excited about the prospects for it to grow and to use the capital that is now in the business and that focus that is now on the business to create better products to grow faster to create better technology to improve customer service.
And of course we will continue to work very closely from a business perspective with the joint venture to serve our mutual customers in a coordinated and combined way.
I would remind you it will be called American Express Travel still so we’re all in and very excited about the fact that we think this is not just a good transaction in the short term for our shareholders but is actually a transaction that will lead to a much stronger travel company in the coming years and we will benefit in many ways from that Great.
Thank you.
Okay so I think operator we have time for one last question.
Okay.
And the final question comes from the line of Chris Donat of Sandler O’Neill.
Please go ahead.
Hey.
Thanks for taking my question Jeff.
Just one quick clarification on the accelerated spend in marketing.
With the recognition of that is it the case that say for something like the production of television ads or radio ads that you might be recognizing expenses in the second quarter but then the ads might not air for subsequent quarters so you kind of front loaded the spending as much as – those who watch television actually see the ads? No I think the reality of how we do our accrual accounting is we have put in to our second quarter P&amp;L what we ran during the second quarter P&amp;L and going forward you will see running through our P&amp;L whatever we run going forward.
Okay.
So we think we were able to get a really strong start for the EveryDay Card and give a strong boost to Serve; and our job going forward will be to build upon that.
Okay.
And then just quick clarification your comments about the revenue and expenses for the joint venture you did say that was using operating expenses not total expenses right I think the 11% number.
Yes absolutely.
Okay.
So if you take – and we’re using 2013 as a baseline to help you with modeling about 11% of operating expenses and about 80% of the travel commissions and fees line.
Got it.
Okay.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Well let me thank you all then for joining tonight’s call and participating in the Q&amp;A.
I think to close the call I believe while there’s some complexity in our results I think the questions demonstrated that from the joint venture transaction.
We feel good about the underlying performance of the company and with that I will wish you all a good evening.
Okay.
Thank you.
And that concludes our conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference Service.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.
(Operator Instructions) And also as a reminder today's teleconference is being recorded.
And at this time I will turn the conference call over to your host Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you and welcome.
We appreciate all of you joining us for today’s call.
The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company’s other reports already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2014 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed.
All of which are posted on our Web site at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter’s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed.
Once Jeff completes his remarks we will move to a Q&amp;A session.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.
Thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone.
I am pleased to be here today to report on another solid quarter of financial results by American Express.
Our performance this quarter reflected higher spending by our card members solid growth in loan balances credit indicators at or near historical lows disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over the past year.
Our earnings per share growth of 12% outpaced revenue growth once again reflecting the benefits of disciplined operating expense control and our share repurchase program.
We also made progress on several newer fronts this quarter attracting additional partners to our OptBlue program acquiring new card members on our EveryDay product and participating in the upcoming Apple Pay Global Wallet launch.
Also during the quarter SAP announced its proposed acquisition of Concur Technologies which as it closes will produce a significant gain for us given our long-standing ownership position in and operating partnership with Concur.
I'll discuss each of these items in further detail later on the call.
Stepping back a bit.
On a year-to-date basis we have been able to drive strong EPS growth within our 12% to 15% long-term target range despite having adjusted revenue growth remain below our long-term targets at approximately 5%.
As we have shown over the last two years the different levers we have to drive earnings performance in a relatively slow growth environment have been a huge asset.
We are beginning to see some modest acceleration in our volumes but revenue is not yet growing as fast as we and I suspect you would like to see.
Our challenge will be to continue to deliver in an environment that may be characterized by modest global economic growth and more intense competition.
While this quarter did not include the many significant items related to the business travel joint venture that complicated our Q2 results it is the first quarter that business travel was not consolidated within our P&amp;L.
You will notice that this change particularly impacts the year-over-year comparisons for both our revenue and expense lines which I'll discuss in further detail as we review the results.
To help you reconcile these impacts I would point you to annex 6 at the back of our slide presentation which provides the historical P&amp;L performance of business travel by quarter.
Now turning to our summary financial performance on Slide 2.
FX adjusted billed business growth increased slightly to 10% during the current quarter including some acceleration in international markets.
Reported revenue was flat to last year but was up 5% if you adjust for business travel and it rounds to 6% when you also adjust for FX given the strengthening dollar we saw as the quarter progressed.
Pretax income rose by 12% during the quarter while net income was only up 8% due to the lower tax rate we experienced last year.
In contrast to this year-over-year tax challenge helping our EPS is the fact that over the last four quarters we have repurchased $4 billion of common shares.
This translated into a 3% decrease in average shares outstanding versus the prior year.
Altogether these factors drove diluted EPS of $1.40 which is 12% higher than the prior year.
I will note that these quarterly results do include some ongoing transition expenses related to the business travel joint venture.
Although this impact was partially offset this quarter by a small gain related to the transaction that was not realized until this quarter.
These results also brought our return on equity for the period ended September 30 to 29% well above are on average and over time target of 25%.
Now turning to a more detailed review of our key performance metrics I'll begin with billed business on Slide 3.
Billed business growth increased to 10% on an FX adjusted basis versus 9% in Q2.
Due to the recent strengthening of the U.S.
dollar that is of course impacting many companies this quarter billed business growth on a reported basis remain consistent with the prior quarter at 9%.
In the U.S.
total billings growth improved by 80 basis points versus the prior quarter but the overall rate still rounded to 9%.
U.S.
corporate and small business is spending both accelerated and had double-digit growth rates during the quarter.
Outside the U.S.
our volumes continued to grow at a faster pace than the total company.
Billed business growth increased to 11% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis up from 9% of quarter.
The improvement was primarily seen in the JAPA region where volume growth was 16% this quarter.
We continued to see very strong volumes in China and also saw improved growth in Australia and Korea.
Moving to billed business by segment on Slide 4.
GNS continues to be our fastest growth segment with volumes increasing by 17% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis.
The strong performance in GNS was primarily driven by the growth in China and Korea that I just mentioned.
I would also remind you that the marginal contribution from each dollar of GNS billings can differ significantly by international markets.
For example all foreign payment players currently operate at little to no margin on spending in China.
But for longer-term strategic reasons China is clearly a market we will remain focused on and we are pleased with the presence we are building there.
Moving to Slide 5.
Loan growth remains consistent with last quarter and was up 5% versus last year on a worldwide basis and 6% in the U.S.
Our loan growth continues to outpace the industry with the differential remaining relatively constant as industry loan growth has also improved recently.
We are continuously focused on spend growth while also accommodating our customers borrowing needs.
As part of our initiatives to have the American Express brand to become ever more welcoming and inclusive we are reaching out to a broader demographic of potential customers.
For some of these new card members the ability to revolve a balance may be a more significant consideration.
Importantly we think we can attract these new customers without significantly changing the overall credit profile of the company.
Our new EveryDay product is an excellent example of this strategy.
The product is focused on driving every day spending behavior while providing the ability to revolve a balance if needed.
We are not changing our credit standards for EveryDay.
These customers would generally have qualified for our products but did not believe we had a card that met their needs.
It's still early days for the EveryDay product but it has performed better than our initial expectations since its launch earlier this year.
Moving to our P&amp;L performance on Slide 6.
As you mentioned reported revenue growth was impacted by the business travel joint venture.
Excluding business travel revenue from prior year results Q3 adjusted revenue growth was 5%.
As you would expect given our spend centric model this growth was primarily driven by greater discount revenue from higher billed business volumes.
We did see billed business growth exceed discount revenue growth by a bit more than in recent quarters.
This was driven in part by our lower discount rate which was down 3 basis points versus the prior year and continues to be driven in part by our ongoing mix shift in volumes towards more retail and every day spend which tend to have lower discount rates.
We are also beginning to see a modest impact on the discount rate related to the OptBlue program.
During the quarter we made excellent progress adding new OptBlue partners including Wells Fargo Elavon and TSYS.
At this point eight of the top ten U.S.
merchant acquirers are now part of the program.
OptBlue merchant acquirers are actively signing new merchants onto the American Express network.
This has resulted in some modest incremental pressure on the discount rate.
But I would remind you that a portion of this impact is offset through reduced operating expenses as we eliminate some of the various incentives we previously paid to the acquirers and the OptBlue merchant acquirers assume both servicing and credit responsibilities.
We continue to believe that OptBlue will bring incremental volumes onto our network and provide attractive economics for our business.
Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was the accelerated growth of our GNS business where we share the discount revenue we earn from merchants with our issuing bank partners.
Last faster growth in contra revenue items including corporate client incentives and strong growth in our cash rebate rewards products also contributed to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth.
Turning to other revenue lines.
Net interest income was the other primary driver of revenue growth.
Growing 9% as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and an increase in average loan balances.
Finally as expected travel commissions and fees declined significantly this quarter as the revenues associated with business travel were no longer consolidated in our P&amp;L.
Turning now to credit performance on Side 7.
You can see that our lending credit metrics remain near or at historically low levels.
Worldwide lending write-off rates declined further during the quarter to 1.5% while delinquency rates remained relatively constant with recent periods at 1.1%.
As a reminder our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best economics on our portfolio.
Therefore at some point we would expect that write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels.
Slide 8 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels.
Coverage levels were relatively consistent with prior periods.
We believe the remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
On Slide 9 you can see that the total amount of provision has been very consistent over the past several quarters.
The fact that our overall credit performance has become more stable and our loan portfolio is growing resulted in a smaller reserve release this quarter than a year ago which was the primary driver of the 16% year-over-year increase in provision.
Moving next to total expenses on Slide 10.
On a reported basis expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year.
Excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year total expenses increased by 1%.
As you can see operating expenses were down 11%.
But this reported growth rate benefited of course from the impact of the business travel joint venture.
Excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year operating expenses were flat to 2013.
Clearly maintaining disciplined control of our expenses particularly operating expenses remains a key driver behind our earnings growth.
I will come back to operating expenses and to the marketing and promotion line where expenses were relatively consistent with last year in a few minutes.
To touch first however on a few other items on Slide 10.
Rewards expense grew by 5% which was slightly lower than reported billed business growth.
We would not usually expect rewards to grow at a slower rate than proprietary billings as this quarter's results were impacted by the true up of certain rewards related reserves.
Finally the tax rate in the quarter was 34.2% which is higher than the 31.8% rate that we experienced during the third quarter of 2013 but in line with our prior expectation that our tax rate for 2014 could be closer to the mid-30s.
To return now to our efforts to grow the business through marketing and promotion.
Slide 11 shows that these expenses were $809 million this quarter and around similar to the levels seen in the second half of last year.
As expected these expenses are down sequentially versus Q2 since marketing and promotion was higher during Q2 as we reinvested a substantial portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives.
We continue to believe that we have a number of attractive investment opportunities across both our core businesses and from newer initiatives.
Looking forward you will likely see an increase in marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 due to the dynamics associated with our investment in Concur.
So let me provide you with some background about our relationship with Concur.
Back in 2008 we entered into an operating agreement with and made a strategic investment in Concur.
The relationship enables us to offer corporate customers an integrated system to make their expense and business travel reporting easier.
Importantly it also provides Concur with the opportunity to significantly grow the scale of their business.
Our relationship has been highly successful and has created significant value for our shareholders.
During September SAP announced that they would be acquiring Concur in a deal that valued the company at $129 per share.
If this proposed transaction is completed it would result in a sizable gain for American Express of approximately $700 million.
Currently Concur and SAP's public expectation is that the transaction will close in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2015.
Our operating agreements with Concur will continue after the transaction is completed and we look forward to partnering with both Concur and SAP in the future.
Given that the proposed Concur acquisition was just announced a few weeks ago we are still in the process of determining exactly how we can best utilize the gain from the transaction.
But looking forward as we have done with similar items in the past we do plan to leverage the favorable impact from the gain to invest in business building activities and initiatives designed to improve operating efficiencies.
Potential growth initiatives could include incremental customer acquisition activities across our core businesses as well as investments to strengthen partner relationships.
In line with our evolving customer and business needs we would also likely fund initiatives designed to improve our efficiency and contain operating expenses going forward.
These investments will provide valuable flexibility to deal proactively with the global regulatory and competitive environment that is rapidly changing particularly in economies that may continue to grow at only a modest pace.
Turning now to our operating expense performance on Slide 12.
As I mentioned operating expenses were down 11% on a reported basis and were flat versus last year when excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year.
The results clearly demonstrate that disciplined control of operating expenses remains a top priority for us and we continue to seek ways to increase the efficiency of our organization.
The impact of business travel varied somewhat by operating expense line.
While the majority of the prior year expenses were within salaries and benefits the impact is sufficiently spread across all expense categories such that line-by-line comparisons are difficult.
I'll also note that operating expenses in the current year include a small amount of ongoing transition another expenses related to the joint venture.
We have an agreement with the joint venture whereby they reimburse us a portion of these expenses as business travel transitions to its new operating structure.
These reimbursements are recorded within other revenue.
On a year to date basis operating expenses remain well-controlled and on an adjusted basis are flat to 2013 as shown on Slide 13.
I'll remind you that while our annual target was for operating expenses to grow by less than 3% during 2014 our year-to-date performance suggests we are on track to come in well below that.
We also continue to achieve our reengineering and cost targets while not just maintaining but actually improving the level of service provided to our customers.
As a result of these improvements customer service remained a key competitive differentiator for American Express.
Now let's turn to capital.
The substantial amount of new capital we generate provides us with significant flexibility as shown on Slide 14.
This quarter we were able to return 89% of the capital we generated to shareholders while also maintaining our strong capital ratios.
Turning than to Slide 15 which shows the impact of Basel III on several minimum capital ratios.
As you know under Basel I the minimum threshold for the tier 1 ratio was 100 basis points lower than that for the minimum tier 1 common ratio.
As a result for American Express the tier 1 ratio historically has never been a binding constant in our capital planning.
But as you also know the requirement for the tier 1 ratio under Basel III is now 150 basis points higher than the common equity tier 1 ratio.
Given this relationship we believe that our capital structure should ultimately include eligible preferred to fund this 150 basis point differential.
When you look across the industry you see that a majority of large financial institutions have included preferred stock in the non-common tier 1 component of their capital structures.
Most importantly the Fed has started using these new minimums to assess capital adequacy and approve capital actions in the CCAR process.
As a result of all these changes or 2014 CCAR submission included the planned issuance of some preferred shares.
We anticipate that this issuance will occur over the next two quarters subject to market conditions.
Looking forward we continue to plan for a 2015 CCAR submission and remain committed to maintaining our strong capital position while leveraging that strength to create value for our shareholders.
I will also note that we just entered into parallel run under the Basel III advance approaches in Q1 and it is too early for us to provide a reliable estimate of its ultimate impact on our capital ratios.
As you know the advanced approaches rules are highly complex and we continue to work with our regulators to clarify certain aspects of these rules.
Leaving capital than let me provide an update on a few other items before concluding.
First the highly speculated upon launch of an Apple Mobile Wallet occurred this quarter with the rollout of Apple Pay which Apple expects to go live later this month.
We are participating in the wallet because we want to be everywhere our customers are and millions of them are devoted Apple users.
The mobile wallets have had the potential to change consumer behavior for some years but it's unlikely to be an overnight shot.
It will take time even with Apple's innovative technology and customer base.
The pace of consumer and merchant adoption will depend on the benefits protection and overall value proposition that participating issuers and networks can provide.
That plays to our strength.
With Apple Pay we are keeping our closed loop advantage intact and the retaining direct relationships with card members and merchants.
In addition the capabilities that we will be integrating into Apple Pay are a foundation that can be used to fuel our growth in mobile payments more broadly in the longer-term.
Next I wanted to touch on the pending loss of our relationship with Costco in Canada.
While we are disappointed that we will longer continue this partnership in Canada we are excited about the launch of our new cash back product in the Canadian market and are focused on retaining many of our customers.
I will note that we have separate agreements with Costco in each of the several markets where we maintain a partnership and have a longer and more significant relationship with Costco in the U.S.
dating back over 15 years.
As with any long-term partnership we work with Costco on an ongoing basis to find ways to drive value for both parties going forward never losing sight of the fact that we are serving the same customers.
Many of you are aware the environment for co-branded products has become increasingly competitive.
From our side we remain focused on developing attractive value propositions for our card members and co-brand partners that still drive strong economics for our shareholders.
Finally as you are aware our trial with the DoJ concluded last week when both sides presented their closing arguments.
We are now waiting for the judge to issue his decision which could take several months or longer to complete.
There will then be a lengthy appeals process in all likelihood as either side has the right to appeal.
Much as we would like to I don't think it's appropriate or beneficial for us to speculate or offer any color commentary on any of the specific testimony.
We believe that our legal defense is a strong but ultimately that will be up to the courts to decide.
So in summary.
Coming back to results we feel good about our overall performance in the current economic environment.
Revenue growth adjusted for the impact of the business travel joint venture and FX increased to 6% reflecting the growth we saw in billings and loans this quarter.
This revenue growth combined with historically low credit metrics disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong capital position allowed us to generate strong growth in EPS.
So with that I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up so that we can ensure with you as many people as possible the chance to participate.
Operator? (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
A couple of questions.
One is on the discount rate and the different programs.
You did a great job of outlining the puts and takes on what's driving the discount rate down broadly and then talked through how those programs also drive down lower operating expenses.
I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of all in where the pretax margin goes including not only the discount rate side but the operating expense side as a total package.
So if you go back Betsy to when we first talked about the economics of OptBlue which I believe was at the financial community meeting in February.
We pointed out that you are correct there is a partial offset to the decline in discount rate because certain other payments we have been making to the merchant acquirers which run through operating expenses we would no longer be making.
Now that is not a complete offset it's a partial offset.
Our strong belief in the overall positive economics of the OptBlue program depend upon our belief that with expended merchant coverage and over the course of the next several years we believe this program in the U.S.
has the ability to make significant strides in the remaining merchant coverage gap we have.
We believe that that will have very strong overall billings and revenue impacts that will more than offset the remaining negative impact on the margin when you just offset the discount rate decline on existing business versus the saving payments to the merchant acquirers.
That will take time as merchant coverage grows and as our customers begin to learn and understand that it grows.
But I would say we are really pleased with the progress we have made with the merchant acquiring community and are very bullish about the long-term prospects for the program.
Okay thanks.
And then separately follow-up question separate topic on preferred.
You indicated the 1.5 percentage point gap that you might be taking advantage of with preferred issuance indicated over the next couple of quarters.
But maybe you could give us a sense as to how much over the next couple of quarters.
I'm wondering if you are intimating that you would fill that entire 150 basis point gap in that period or if that's over a longer period of time? I think our view and of course some of this will depend a little bit Betsy on market conditions.
But sitting here today our view is we will probably begin to fill the gap.
And of course the way the CCAR process works as you know we are committed to filling a portion of the gap that we put in our CCAR 2014 submission.
But it would not take us all the way to filling the entire gap.
We do believe in the long run given the way the rules work that the right permanent long-term capital structure will eventually get us to that level.
We probably won't get there with the first couple of issuances.
I would also point out that I don't want to drag everyone throughout the map but it's a fairly complex calculation because what you really focus on is getting to that 150 basis points in a stress scenario through the CCAR process because that's really where it would potentially become a binding constraint for us.
Right.
So this should be over several more than a handful of quarters I would expect.
Yes.
I don't want to speculate on just how many quarters because again it's tricky always to predict market dynamics and we will also be making some calls about how the market for these securities evolves and how the overall market evolves particularly considering today's events.
But it will certainly take more than the two quarters that we talked about in my prepared remarks.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Please go ahead.
I guess I wanted to go back to your opening comments on revenue growth not being in line with your long-term targets for a bit.
And I was wondering what sort of initiatives or plans you have to get that going some.
I guess one area that could I think of is some of these investments that you have made or reinvestments of the gains you have made what is the payback time period? How do we assess whether or not the efficacy of those dollars are working? And I guess second question just on the macro picture.
Obviously it's a point of debate across the markets and I was just wondering if you have seen any discernible trends this month specifically because just the magnitude of deterioration has been fairly significant.
Also maybe tie in any travel related impacts that you might see because of the virus? Thank you.
Well let me try to take those kind of one at a time Sanjay and I would start with your revenue growth questions.
And I think I would preface my remarks by saying we have a number of long-term targets.
We have a EPS target in the 12% to 15% range a return on equity 25% or better and revenue growth at 8% or above.
Certainly our number one focus as we think about those targets is achieving the kind of very consistent EPS growth that you have seen us create quite a good track record of over the last few years.
And when we think of the 8% revenue growth target that is a facilitating lever to help us achieve those EPS targets.
But one of the things that we began to talk about a few years ago and that I think we have really demonstrated over the last few years is we have other levers to use in varied economic environments to get to our 12% to 15% EPS target even when we can't get to the revenue environment we would like.
So when you say what would we do to continue to get revenue up well we think about investments across the short medium and long-term horizon.
And of course we could probably get the revenue growth up in the near-term higher than it is today if we abandon some of the things we're doing that we think are quite important for the longer-term.
And two of the things you have heard us talk a lot about in the last couple of years are loyalty partner and loyalty coalition investments along with the things we're doing in the reloadable prepaid markets.
We continue to believe in those long-term investments but they are not in the near-term going to return as strong or as high a return as what you would get if we plow the funds we put in to those products into our core businesses.
We think we have the balance about right although there is an art to it and in many ways we would suggest that the bottom line test is are we hitting the EPS targets given where revenue growth is.
And also just to remind you that for our business the real correlation is with year-over-year GDP growth.
We went into this year with the consensus forecast in the U.S.
for GDP growth to approach 3%.
The latest consensus is down at about 2.2% year-over-year for all of 2014 and it's anyone's judgment who is listening to this call what events of recent days might mean even to that number.
So we are actually pretty pleased with our EPS performance given that environment.
And we are quite committed to the balanced approach we take across thinking about our spending and investments in terms of short term medium term and long-term investments.
The last comment I would make is when you think about an event like the June quarter increase in our investment spending.
I think you have to put it into a little bit of perspective.
We talked on last quarter's call about doing perhaps an incremental $300 million or so of marketing and promotion.
I would remind you that we spend over the course of the year $3 billion to $3.5 billion of marketing and promotion.
So when you think about that increment over the course of the year it's a fairly modest increment.
For the portion of that spending that is targeted at near term initiatives you would expect to see the results as you get into the second third and fourth quarters subsequent to the spend and we're pretty pleased with what we have seen thus far.
But it's a fairly modest component of the overall spend.
To go into your last question on macro trends.
In general we don't like to comment a lot on intra-quarter billing trends because there tends to be a fair amount of volatility just depending on day of week when holidays fall etc.
So I wouldn't comment on that.
And in terms of recent events I think it's just too early for us to say what will happen to either billing or travel related bookings given all the media news of the last few days.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays.
Please go ahead.
The first question is on Apple Pay.
Can you comment on whether you had to make any concessions around the discount rate to be included and also just contextualize how the role there fits in to your broader strategy to build your own proprietary mobile wallet? Well I don't think Mark that anyone is likely to comment on any of the contract terms here.
I would point out we don't really comment on contract terms with any of our partners.
More broadly our philosophy is we want to be everywhere that our card members want to be.
And there is a real affinity between the Apple brand and what it means in our card member base.
So we are very excited to be a part of this launch.
We think it fits very well with our brand and card member value proposition and as we have said for a long time form factor is not particularly important to us.
We have tremendous share in online products we have a tremendous partnership with someone like Uber where of course you don't see any physical card presence and it really takes advantage of some of our unique digital and customer capabilities.
The closed loop gives us an ability to in Apple Pay and in any other digital setting do some things for both the card members and the merchants that are challenging for others to emulate.
So we are very excited about being part of this launch and think over time it can really be helpful in the continuing trend towards less use of cash and more use of card payments.
And that's a very good thing for us and frankly a very good thing for the industry.
Okay great.
Next question is just a follow-up on the timing of the preferred issuance.
Was the Fed essentially forcing you to trap capital here kind of leaving you at ratios well above the longer-term economic capital targets? Why issue now instead of later when you are closer to being able to get to levels that are consistent with your long-term targets? Well the short answer of course is we are issuing now because we committed to issuance in our CCAR submission.
The longer answer for why we put it in the CCAR submission is that when you think about our capital constraints you do have to consider them in the context of the stress scenarios that the Fed runs which can produce very very different results from what you may see when you look at our balance sheet.
And the judgment we made is we submitted CCAR our CCAR submission in 2014 was that the most prudent route to ensure that we continue to do the kinds of very aggressive returns of capital to our shareholders that we have been doing.
And I would remind you that are -- we have been amongst the highest of any of the CCAR banks in terms of the amount of capital that we have been returning.
The way to ensure we could continue to have a strong platform to do that given the evolution in the rules given the way the process works best way to do that was to put a portion of preferred into our capital structure.
And that's what we committed to and therefore the will see us execute.
As I said in answer to Betsy earlier you won't see us get all the way up to the full level until some later point in time.
But what our judgment was it's prudent to begin that process now.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.
The first thing I just wanted to go back to was the effect or the impact of OptBlue on your discount rate.
And specifically what I was curious about is it was a meaningful enough impact for you to call it out and you have a 3 basis point decline year-over-year in your discount rate overall.
So that seems to suggest that in a short period of time there has been a lot of uptake in terms of the amount of volume coming through your OptBlue partners.
So am I thinking of that incorrectly because on a proportional basis I need to work out the exact math but it does seem like it probably had a significant impact in a relatively short period of time.
So could you help us size that a little bit in terms of maybe volume coming through your OptBlue partners or merchants incrementally that have signed up etcetera? Well I think it's a still very early days for the program.
And I would remind you that there is really two aspects to this.
One is that we will get expanded merchant coverage over time as the acquirers go out and find merchants who do not take American Express today and are very attracted to a simple product offering that gives them the ability to expand the range of customers they can reach.
Those acquirers will also take some of their existing customer base and put them on these simpler and we think more attractive OptBlue program.
And so there is a mixture of both of those things going on right now.
And the expansion in the spending at the new merchants will take some time because our card members will take some time to even realize when merchants get added and what the benefits are of that expanded coverage.
So for all of those reasons we are quite comfortable in fact quite pleased with the early days of the program.
And the fact that the acquirers have been signing on a little quicker than we expected is why the modest impact has hit us a little bit more quickly than we had in our plan.
We actually see that as a good thing however.
Okay thank you.
And then just another question I had and I am not sure if this is something you have tracked recently.
But I know in the past Ken has talked about the migration up-market in terms of more premium cards or the movement between card products as an indicator of what's going on with the underlying consumer that you are targeting.
So I was curious if that's something you have looked at recently to look at migration upwards or downwards to give you a reading on what's going on with the health of consumers.
Are we seeing a slowdown in the improvement or any sort of read throughs from that? I was just curious if you had any more recent data? Well I think the short answer is of course we look very closely at all the trends across all of the many products.
And one of the hallmarks I think of our business model is that we strongly believe that we have a broad range of products because we want to have the right product for the right card member and people have very very different needs.
Well I'll tell you when we look across our portfolio now we see some very strong performance in some of our premium products.
We are very pleased and in fact have exceeded our expectations on the take-up with our new EveryDay card which is clearly targeted at a very different demographic customers who value the revolve feature.
As you mentioned in my script you see some of our cash back rewards for our products growing particularly strongly right now and that contributes a little bit to some of the difference between billed business growth and discount revenue growth.
So when you look across our portfolio there is no particular trends that we can point you to that show migration patterns that are different than what we have experienced historically.
Okay.
Thank you.
And I know I have exceeded my quota but just a quick last one.
The Concur gain this quarter did you quantify how much that was that flowed through your income statement? Well so remember SAP hopes or expects that the transaction will close in the fourth quarter and we would expect that it will generate a gain for us of about $700 million.
Okay.
Because I thought in one of the in the supplement it talked about some small gain flowing through this quarter as well.
So maybe [through it] (ph)? Yes.
So as you know we have for many years have been selling off at a modest pace very large gains we generated some years back from our investment in ICBC the Chinese bank.
The sale of those shares came to an end in the September quarter and we are now completely sold out on that position.
We have been considering a range of alternatives as we reached an end of that ICBC investment sale one of which was to begin to sell modest bits of Concur.
That plan was beginning to be executed and thought about and SAP came along and changed our trajectory.
So there is really nothing more than that going on with a very modest sales that you see referenced in the document.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities.
Please go ahead.
I apologize for going back again to the capital question with the preferred but I'm trying to make sure that I understand the reason for including the preferred issuance in your CCAR submission.
So from an academic perspective I get that it makes sense to fill that 150 basis point gap between total capital and common equity tier 1 minimums under Basel III.
But in reality I thought of CCAR as the real binding constraint for most card issuers given that losses tend to be quite high for unsecured credit card loans under a severely adverse scenario.
And so if you have to run at call it 12% common equity tier 1 levels for CCAR purposes haven't you already filled the preferred bucket with common equity and so what's the benefit of the preferred? Maybe if you could just speak to that it would be very helpful.
So that's exactly the right question Bill.
The thing you have to remember is your binding constraint in CCAR is whatever your absolute low point is over and nine quarter period.
So in CCAR 2014 you were running into 2015 when the new minimums come into effect.
You are running a severe stress scenario where the Fed does the modeling and you are sustaining your capital payouts.
So one of the realities for us as a bank which has made very aggressive requests for share repurchase along with dividends.
That means when you sustain those right through a severe stress scenario particularly when you have a company like American Express which if you look at our payouts lately we're paying out over 25% of our regulatory capital base each year.
The math quickly takes you from what on the surface looks like a very highly capitalized company and we of course believe we are very highly and well-capitalized to one that actually begins to in that severely stress scenario where you I might suggest unrealistically sustain your capital payouts right through that severely stress scenario you begin to approach those minimums.
And as we thought about how do we make sure we don't trip those minimums our choice was fill it with more common or fill it with some preferred.
And we clearly chose to fill it for our shareholders with preferred because it's more economic buffer.
I see.
That's very helpful.
Thank you.
Separately as you discussed earlier you guys have been able to despite a lackluster growth environment deliver EPS growth at the low end of your on average and over time target range by pulling on all the levers that you have available to you.
And I guess when we pull together all of the comments that you have made on that issue tonight is it reasonable to take away from that that you continue to have confidence in your ability to generate results that are in line with at least the low end of your on average and over time target? Even if it's just at the lower end of that range? I think what you should take away from all of my comments is that our track record we are using the range of levers we have to meet our EPS targets are pretty good.
Our track record is very good and we have a lot of levers.
And our job and our focus is on using all the levers we have to continue to achieve that kind of performance.
It is more challenging in a modest economic growth environment where everything from the capital rules to the regulatory environment to the competitive environment just gets tougher every day but that's our job.
That's what you pay us to do.
And we are committed to using every lever we have to stay focused on meeting those EPS targets.
One of the important ingredients in being able to do that has been the positive operating leverage.
And I think your commitment to keeping operating expense growth below 3% through the end of this year has given really the market a lot of confidence in your ability to generate that positive operating leverage.
Is that something that would you be willing to consider extending that beyond this year? And that was my last question.
So we are not -- we are in the middle of our planning process right now for 2015 and so we are certainly not ready on this call to talk about what our targets are on operating expense going forward.
But I would make a few obvious comments which is we are in a business where we get some benefits from scale as our company continues to grow.
And while I was calling our 5% revenue growth quite accurately less then we and probably you had hoped for I would remind you that for a company of our size to have revenue growth in a 2% growth economy of 5% is actually if you look at other industries is not a bad number.
That gives us the benefit of scale which is a helpful thing as we try to control operating expenses as we continue to grow.
And we are also in businesses where technology helps us every year find new ways to be more efficient and where the behavior of our merchants and our card members every year is more and more about us finding ways to engage them digitally.
Quite frankly that's also a less expensive and more efficient way for us to engage with them.
So we are not ready to give targets yet on expenses for next year but what we are ready to say is we are very committed to using all the levers that are at disposal to meet our financial targets.
And we have some natural advantages given our growth and our business model in finding ways to continually control operating expenses and get that very important operating leverage that you talked about.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from James Friedman with Susquehanna.
Please go ahead.
I will just ask my two upfront Jeff to respect the constraints of the call.
So first one is housekeeping.
The salary and employee benefits this is Slide 12 at $1.29 billion.
Is that a good run rate moving forward for the rest of the year? Obviously there's been a lot of movement in that.
That's my first question.
And my second question is a couple of the networks MasterCard and Visa have introduced fees related to tokenization.
You guys were there at the authoring of tokenization.
My question about tokenization is do you have a revenue model associated with that? So the first one is about salaries the second is about tokens.
Thank you.
Well let me maybe work those in backward order here.
We are constantly looking at ways to add value through innovation technology scale or closed loop.
We are constantly looking to find ways using all of those tools add value to our merchants.
Frankly we also expect when we find ways to add value that there will be reasonable compensation.
Now that's a very general statement and we will have to see on any particular subject I don't want to comment on tokenization in particular where the market goes and what kind of value we can deliver to our partners.
But certainly our general view is that we add value in a lot of ways and we should get compensated for it.
On the salary and benefit point there is always some quarter to quarter volatility so I'm going to be a little cautious on giving you a line item specific bit of guidance.
I would make the point that salary and benefits are half or a little more of our overall operating expense.
We are very committed to maintaining the trends you have seen thus far.
And while you can't maintain the trends you have seen over the last few years without maintaining a very tight control around all of our employee related costs.
I just want to point out that you do get a little bit of quarter to quarter volatility sometimes particularly in the fourth quarter as you true up things at your end.
Thank you.
So operator I think we have time for one more question.
Thank you sir.
And that will come from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.
Please go ahead.
I wonder if you could talk for a minute about the potential impact on billed business and maybe revenues from the decline in gas prices we've seen and the further step-down in the value of a couple of currencies that you're exposed to late in the third quarter and as we've moved into the fourth quarter? Well let me maybe work those in reverse order.
On the currency side we actually if you go back to Q1 we put a slide into our earnings call deck to help people understand a little bit which currencies we have significant exposure to.
And I would also remind you even on that slide we have exposure at the revenue and billings line there is some natural hedges to that because in many of the countries where we have the largest billings and revenue exposure we also have just substantial operations.
And so those provide some level of natural hedge.
When you look at the range of currencies that matter for us it's also a general truism that you seldom find all of those currencies moving in the same direction.
Even if you look at our third quarter the UK is a very significant country for us but it was actually fairly flat versus the U.S.
dollar versus some of the other currencies.
So this is a headwind for us.
I would say it's generally a modest and manageable headwind unless we see an almost unprecedented across the board strengthening of the dollar.
And given the events of the last few days I certainly wouldn't want to say that won't happen but in general it's a manageable effect for us.
In terms of gas obviously our gas sales in terms of our overall business are not particularly material part of our billed business.
I would just make the obvious point that for many other things in our economy that people to spend more money on lower gas prices are generally a good thing.
I guess I am an ex-airline CFO so lower gas prices are generally really good thing to travel.
But boy you certainly have some pretty tough to read challenging counter trends on travel right now when you look at all the news about turmoil in the world and Ebola.
So it's hard to know how all that will play out.
And so we will just remain committed to using all the levers we have to manage through whatever the economic environment brings for us.
So I'd like to thank everybody for joining tonight's call and participating in the Q&amp;A session.
I'm going to wish you all a good evening but I'm going to turn it back over to Rick Petrino who will provide a brief overview of the investor conferences we plan to participate in during the fourth quarter.
Rick? Thanks Jeff.
So as part of our commitment to provide investors with exposure to company's management our executives plan to speak at several events in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead through the balance of 2014 Jeff plans to speak at the Merrill Lynch Banking and Financial Services Conference in New York on November 13.
In addition Ken Chenault plans to participate in two upcoming conferences.
The first will be in Las Vegas on November 4 as part of the Money 2020 Conference and the second will be also in New York on December 10 for the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference.
Live audio webcast of each of these events will be made available to the public through the American Express IR Web site at ir.americanexpress.com.
Thanks again for joining tonight's call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express.
Thank you.
And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference call for today.
We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T's executive teleconference.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.
At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode.
Later there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time.
[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I’ll now turn the conference over to your host Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you.
Welcome and we appreciate everyone joining us for today’s call.
The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company’s other reports already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2014 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior period that may be discussed.
All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter’s earnings to the series of slides included with the earning documents distributed.
Once Jeff completes his remarks we will move to a Q&amp;A session.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.
Well thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone happy to be here to discuss the results that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014.
We are pleased to see both our fourth quarter and full year EPS growth rates at 15% and 14% respectively within our on-average and overtime targets.
This solid performance reflected familiar themes across the entire year higher spending by our card members modest acceleration in U.S.
loan growth credit indicators at or near historical lows strong cost controls and a healthy balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.
There was some complexity to our results this quarter and year.
As we took advantage of the Q4 gain on the sale of our investment in Concur Technologies.
And the Q2 gain on the creation of the business travel joint venture to fund incremental initiatives to position the company for the long term.
This quarter these initiatives included a restructuring incremental investment in growth initiatives and an upfront cost related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines.
Given the increasingly competitive environment for co-branded partnerships we are excited to have extended our relationship with Delta for the long-term.
More broadly we believe all of these incremental initiatives will provide flexibility as we deal proactively with the global economic competitive regulatory environment that continues to be uncertain and rapidly changing.
As I begin with the financial summary on Page 2 of the Slide I’ll discuss both the quarter and full year results.
As we believe this helps highlight some of the key performance trends and challenges we face as we enter 2015.
Our reported billings growth was 6% during the fourth quarter but 8% on an FX adjusted basis.
As we like many other global companies had a significant negative impact on our growth rates this quarter from the strengthening U.S.
dollar.
For the year we exceeded $1 trillion of spending on our network for the first time.
We build business up 9% versus last year on an FX adjusted basis.
As you can see we exited the year slightly below our full year FX adjusted growth rate as we did see a modest deceleration in billings growth during the fourth quarter.
I’ll provide more details on our Q4 billings performance in a few minutes.
So clearly the sharp drop in gas prices and soft December retail sales for the industry had an impact on our results.
During the quarter adjusted for the Concur gain which is reported in revenue and for the business travel revenues in the prior year adjusted revenue growth was 3% to 5% when you further adjust for FX.
The FX adjusted growth rate is consistent with our full year performance otherwise note that the drag from FX on our revenue and earnings increased over the course of 2014 due to the strengthening of the dollar.
Pretax income grew 12% during the quarter and 14% for the year in part benefiting from our continued disciplined control of operating expenses.
Net income grew more slowly at 11% for the quarter and 10% for the year.
We have seen higher tax rate throughout the course of the year and the tax rate in the fourth quarter of 35% was a bit above the full year level and above what we might expect going forward.
Helping us again this year has been our share repurchase activity.
Over the last four quarters we have repurchased $4.4 billion in common shares which has reduced our average shares outstanding by 4% versus the prior year.
Addedall upand during 2014 we delivered fourth quarter EPS of $1.39 and full year EPS of $5.56 which were up 15% and 14% respectively versus the prior year and we are within our on average and overtime target.
We were able to generate these earnings with revenue growth that was solid given the uncertain global economic environment disciplined expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position.
These results also brought our return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 29% well above our on average and overtime target of 25%.
Let’s move on to a detailed review of our Q4 results beginning with the impact of the Concur gain and related incremental initiatives.
As you recall we entered into an operating agreement and made a strategic investment in Concur back to 2008.
The partnership has created significant value for both our customers and shareholders.
During December SAP acquired 100% of Concur including our entire investment triggering a pretax gain of $719 million inline with our previous estimates.
Going forward our operating agreements with Concur we concurred are continue and we look forward to a continuing partnership with both SAP and Concur.
In the quarter consistent with our previously announced expectations which took advantage of the gain to fund initiatives that included a restructuring and upfront cost related to our decision to accelerate renewal of our relationship with delta and incremental investments in growth initiatives.
Given the rapid changes in our industry and the sizable set of economically attractive growth opportunities that our company has we believe that these were the right long-term decisions for shareholders.
Starting with the restructuring charge the actions we were taking will impact over 4 000 people at a cost of $313 million in the quarter.
Total employee headcount will decline by a smaller amount as certain of those reductions will be partially offset by jobs created elsewhere in the company.
The actions we are taking largely represent a continuation of our strategy to further increase the overall efficiency of our organization.
Our business and industry continue to be transformed by technology which is increasingly becoming more powerful and less expensive.
Technology is also changing the way our merchants and card members want to interact with us and has created new channels of communication that have increased overall card members satisfaction.
As a result of these changes we have the need and the opportunity to continuously evolve our organization and cost structure giving us the ability to maintain tight control of operating expenses while still investing for growth.
We also used a portion of the Concur gain in conjunction with the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines.
We are excited about the new agreement with Delta.
Particularly given the increasingly competitive environment for co-brands.
We decided to accelerate the Delta renewal as we saw an attractive opportunity to extend a long-term relationship with the key partner.
Our new agreement had an upfront cost of approximately $109 million in Q4 related to the new contract terms around Membership Rewards including a small impact related to a previously announced cap on point transfers into Delta SkyMiles for membership awards.
This cap was removed as part of our new agreement which we believe is good news for our card members.
As a reminder we took a similar upfront charge back in 2008 when we last renewed our partnership with Delta or generally often when long-term co-branded partnerships are renewed the new agreement will reflect shifts in market economics that have evolved over many years.
All things being equal our renewed co-brand agreement will often provide us with lower economics initially than the prior agreement and will be structured to inset growth and generate additional revenues for both parties over time.
The magnitude of this reset could be significant depending on the size of each partnership.
Our agreement with Delta is no exception to these market realities.
I told we feel very positive about the potential of the renewed relationship to generate benefits over the longer-term.
However when we think about our near-term outlook we will need to take into account the impact of the new agreement.
Looking at the entire landscape for co-brand products well the competitive environment has become more intense; we continue to see attractive opportunities.
We’ve been very disciplined and selective in the partners we work with and have focused on the relationships that can offer the best value the best growth potential and the best returns over time.
In this context we were also pleased to recently renew our long-term relationship with Starwood as with Delta we believe that this relationship provides attractive value for card members and opportunities for growth going forward.
Coming back now to how we leverage the Concur gain during the quarter on Slide 3.
You see that we also made incremental investments in the diverse set of growth opportunities within our company.
These investments were primarily; do not entirely in marketing and promotion and we’re focused on acquisition activities across the strong suite of products we offer to consumers small businesses and corporations around the world.
I remind you that our co-brands are one important component of our business model.
We believe that the great of breadth and global nature of our product set provides a significant competitive advantage.
Going to the numbers well there is some subjectivity in determining the level of incremental investments that we made as a result of the Concur gain.
It was a significant amount in the quarter leaving a net gain from Concur of approximately $0.05 to $0.06.
Thinking about our overall results some of the other way it clearly has a negative foreign exchange impact from the strengthening U.S.
dollar as well as a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter.
Let’s turn now to a more detailed view of quarterly performance metrics starting with Billed business in Slide 4.
During the fourth quarter Billed business growth slowed sequentially from 9% to 6% on a reported basis.
The decline was impacted by the recent strengthening of the U.S.
dollar as FX adjusted billings grew by 8% during the fourth quarter.
Looking at the results by segments you can see the growth in our U.S.
consumer and small business segments slowed sequentially from 9% to 8% in Q4.
This sequential decline was influenced by the large drop in gas prices relatively soft retail sales industry wide during the month of December.
GNS continues to be our strongest performing segment with FX adjusted growth of 15% during the quarter.
And while FX adjusted growth in ICS slowed to 3% during the quarter we saw a very different performance trends by region as you can see by moving to Slide 5.
Here you can see the billings in our LACC region dropped more significantly during the fourth quarter due to a decline in spent at Costco Canada.
While American Express cards were still accepted in Costco warehouses throughout Canada during the quarter we began to see billings decline after card acceptance was expanded to include other networks on October 1.
I would remind you that beginning January 1 2015 American Express cards were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada which we expect will drive billings growth lower during 2015.
In contrast to the LACC experience we saw continued improvement in our EMEA billings which showed their strongest FX adjusted growth since Q2 2011.
The increase was driven primarily by strong performance in the UK and improved growth in Germany.
All of these results outside the U.S.
were impacted by foreign exchange movements which is why we’ve added Slide 6 this quarter which is a slide that shows our reported and FX adjusted revenue growth rates for the last eight quarters.
As you can see during the fourth quarter foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our reported results than in prior periods dragging adjusted revenue growth by approximately 240 basis points.
To give you a better sense of the drivers here we have also provided some background on the major concentrations of our billed business by international currency.
The first row at the bottom of the chart shows the approximate range of billed business by card members in each market has as a percentage of total company billed business and the second row shows the year-over-year change in that foreign currency prepared to U.S.
dollar.
Can you look at the slide? It is somewhat unusual that the dollar has strengthened significantly against nearly all of the international currencies where we generate a significant amount of revenue.
As you know this revenue in fact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies.
There is a bottom-line impact especially when rates move this dramatically.
As you can see in our annual report we estimate that a 10% strengthening of the dollar against all international currencies in which we do business would cost approximately $200 million in pretax income over a one-year period.
So clearly as I mentioned earlier it was a negative impact to our bottom line.
Over the long-term we continue to believe that being a global company which generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a significant benefit of our business model.
However if current trends do continue FX rates will represent a headwind as we head into 2015.
Moving on now to loan growth on Slide 7.
Loan growth was up 5% versus last year on a reported basis.
We were obviously pleased though by our performance in the U.S.
which constitutes the majority of our loans as growth improved to 7% during Q4 and continues to outpace the industry.
I note that international loan growth was down year-over-year as performance was negatively impacted by FX rates and also by a decline in loans within the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
Looking forward we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Our efforts here are not about a transformational shift away from our spend-centric model but still do represent a sizable growth opportunity for our company.
So let’s move now to our revenue performance on Slide 8 where you see there are reported revenue growth in Q4 was 7% adjusted however for the Concur gain the loss of business travel revenues in the prior year and FX.
Adjusted revenue growth was 5% which was consistent with our full year performance.
I note that the Concur gain is reported in other revenue which is still the large year-over-year increase in that line.
The largest contribution to adjusted revenue growth again came greater discount revenue from the higher billed business volumes.
As we saw last quarter there was roughly 400 basis point gap between billed business growth and discount revenue growth.
The first driver of this difference is the reported discount rate which was down three basis points versus the prior year.
As a reminder we provide this reported discount rate calculation to give you some context about our pricing at point of sale with merchants.
This quarter’s decline reflects in part our ongoing makeshift in volumes towards lower discount rate industries so this impact was partially offset in the current quarter by the drop in Costco Canada merchant volume where we earned a lower discount rate.
This quarter’s discount rate was also impacted by the timing of certain merchant contract signings.
The quarter’s discount rate also reflects a modest but growing impact related to the OptBlue program as merchant acquirers are actively signing new merchants onto the American Express network.
We are encouraged by our progress in this multiyear effort it does results in some incremental pressure on a reported discount rate as we have previously discussed.
But I would remind that a portion of this decline is offset through reduced operating expenses as OptBlue shifts the impact of certain third party acquisition activities from operating expenses to discount revenue.
We continue to believe that OptBlue will bring incremental volumes on to our network over the next several years and provide attractive economies for our business.
Coming back now to the broader relationship between discount revenue and billed business similar to last quarter the other drivers of the gap between the two of the faster growth we’re seeing in both contra revenue items such as cash incentives and GNS volumes.
I would point out here that the relationship between discount revenue and billed business has become more complicated overtime partially due to the impact related to OptBlue I just mentioned.
And so interpreting our discount rate metric in isolation has become more complex as our business has evolved.
Now turning to the other revenue lines net interest income was the other primary driver of revenue growth growing 8% is we continue to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and an increase in average loan balances.
Finally as expected travel commissions and fees declined significantly this quarter as the revenues associated with business travel were no longer consolidated in our P&amp;L.
Turning now to credit performance on Slide 9 you can see that our lending credit metrics remained near or at historically low levels.
Worldwide lending write-off rates and delinquency rates declined slightly during the quarter though overall the rate of improvement in these metrics has slowed past year As a reminder our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best economics on our portfolio.
Therefore at some point we would expect that write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels.
In terms of lending reserve coverage levels Slide 10 shows the coverage remained relatively consistent after considering the impact of the seasonal ramp up in loan balances on the month coverage metric.
We believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Putting together our solid loan growth with these credit metrics you can see on Slide 11 the total provision in Q4 increased significantly versus both last year and the prior quarter.
Although credit metrics remained low and write-offs remain a bit below the prior year the rate of improvement has slowed.
The strength along with the growth and seasonal uptick and loan balances and some smaller specific reserve builds are what drove the provision up 22% this quarter.
Moving next to total expenses on Slide 12.
On a reported basis expenses increased by 3% versus the prior year in Q4 and were flat for the full year reflecting the decision to reinvest the majority of the Concur gain in Q4 the GBT gain in Q2 partially offset by the loss of our business travel expenses in the prior year.
I’ll provide more details on our marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes.
To touch first however on a few other items on Slide 12 rewards expense provide 10% in Q4 in part due to the $109 million impact from our renewed agreement with Delta on a full year basis.
Rewards expense growth of 7% was relatively consistent with our reported proprietary billings growth.
Also on Slide 12 the tax rate in the quarter was 35% slightly above what we have seen in the past couple of quarters as it was impacted by the resolution of certain prior year items.
Prior to this quarter we had been trending at a tax rate of approximately 34% while in any given quarter to screen items because impact the effective rate we generally think 34% is more indicative of our underlying run rate.
Moving to marketing and promotional expenses on Slide 13 as I discuss the two sizable gains we recognized in 2014 allows us to invest in a number of attractive growth opportunities and we believe this is the right decision to create value for shareholders.
As a result marketing and promotion expenses were the majority of our incremental investments and growth initiatives were recorded increased sequentially and grew 13% versus Q4 2013 and 9% on a full year basis.
For the year much of this spending focused on acquiring card members across our diverse set of card portfolios.
These initiatives included acquisition efforts for our proprietary charge in lending products as well as opportunities in the co-brand space.
Additionally we were focused on expanding our merchant network capturing a greater share of our card members lending building out our GNS business and growing our newer digital business.
One example how we build relationships with small businesses across local merchant network and our card member base was our support this past quarter of the small business sed rate.
This initiative now takes place across six countries and is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base.
Turning now to operating expense performance for Q4 on Slide 14 our reported results continue to reflect the impact of business travel operations in the prior year across a number of expense categories complicating line by line comparisons.
Additionally the impact of our restructuring charge this quarter had substantial impact on salaries and benefits.
That said adjusting for last year’s GBT operations and this year’s restructuring charge operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter on a reported basis and increased by 1% on adjusting for FX.
Turning to the full year our adjusted operating expense growth remained well contained and came in well below on 3% growth target for the year as you can see on Slide 15.
We continue to demonstrate disciplined control of our operating expenses and this marked the second consecutive year that operating expense growth was significantly below the growth target that we set on our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.
These discipline around operating expenses allow us to continue investing for growth and provided increased financial flexibility in an economy that remains uncertain.
As we look ahead the restructuring actions that we are taking our one part of what will allow us to remain discipline by operating expenses growth.
Now shifting our focus towards capital on Slide 16 the benefits of our strong capital discipline position were on display all year as we returned 86% of the capital generated in the year while modestly strengthening our already strong capital ratios.
As is usual you do see our capital ratios decline slightly sequentially during the fourth quarter due to the seasonal increase in our loan and receivable balances.
A portion of the year-over-year increase on our tier 1 capital ratio was driven by the preferred issuance we executed during the fourth quarter and we plan to follow this with another issuance in Q1.
As I discussed on the last earnings call these issuances represents the most cost effective way to meet our evolving capital requirements and were part of the capital plan in our 2014 CCAR submission.
Now we did of course complete our submissions for the 2015 CCAR process earlier this month.
We expect a year back from the FET said about our submission in March.
We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years while continuing to increase our capital ratios illustrates the strength of both our balance sheet and our business model.
We also worked hard to satisfy the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the sales guidelines and continue to strengthen aspects of our capital planning processes to support this critical effort.
So coming back to our full year results.
We are pleased with our performance in the current economic competitive environment.
For the full year we had earnings per share growth of 14% which is within our on average and over time target while leveraging the gains provided by the business travel joint venture and the sale of our investment in Concur will better position the company.
Looking forward to 2015 we do face a number of increasing challenges including global economic growth that is forecast to remain below long-term averages foreign exchange headwinds from a strengthening U.S.
dollar intense competition in the co-brand space and a heightened regulatory environment particularly in the EU.
Of course many of these issues are not new.
And we face these challenges from a strong position with many growth opportunities and assets that will give us a competitive advantage.
We remain constant that our business model provides the opportunity to deliver significant value to our shareholders over the longer-term.
With that I’ll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&amp;A session.
Great thanks Jeff.
Just before we start the Q&amp;A I do want to say that in response to feedback we have been receiving we’re going to try to provide a better opportunity for more analysts to ask a question today so considering that I do want to ask that everyone in the queue please limiting yourself to just one question seriously.
And so thanks for your cooperation with that.
And we can now turn it over and start the Q&amp;A operator.
Thank you.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ken Bruce with Bank of America.
Go ahead please.
Thank you good afternoon.
Could you possibly give us some more details around what the benefits from the restructuring charge will be in terms of you mentioned the reduced headcount but over what period of time should we really be thinking about the net benefits from that restructuring please? That's a good question Ken.
We of course have been on a steady journey here for a number of years to continually evolve our business how we operate how we interact with our card members and our merchants take advantage of evolving technologies make sure we have the right footprint.
And this is really a continuation of that strategy.
Now some of these moves are complicated and it will really take us the course of calendar 2015 to execute on pretty much all of the things that are in the restructuring charge that you see us taking in Q4.
So there will be some benefits in 2015.
The full run rate benefits of all the actions we’re taking however you will see as we get into 2016.
So I think as we look at the actions we’re taking we’re seeing it as something that will be helpful to us in 2015 to continue the kind of strong discipline you’ve seen us have on operating expenses and frankly we’re also position to get some further help in 2016 incrementally as the initiatives take full effect.
Thank you.
I’ll honor the one question rule [indiscernible] Great example.
Thank you we’ll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Maybe along the same lines as well Ken was asking.
Could you just talk about how we should think about the core operating efficiency ratio of the enterprise? You guys have been making a series of reengineering and restructuring or taking up a bunch of reengineering and restructuring initiatives.
I would assume that that would take that core run rate lower but the last kind of update we got on that was kind of high 60s.
Could you just talk about that a little bit? Thanks.
I think Sanjay it’s a good question.
We’re a little cautious about setting a specific target because the way we run the business evolves over time and we don’t want to either set too high a target.
Take advantage of all the opportunities we may have to become more efficient.
And frankly there are other times when there are things that we think can help drive long-term growth in the business that may run through various parts of our P&amp;L and various parts of the expense structure that we think that are right things to do.
We don’t want to preclude ourselves from spending.
So I think the way we think about it is as you go forward and you think to put your and Ken’s question together about the restructuring we’re just doing.
We’re not setting renewal operating expense target publicly for now but you’re certainly not going to see us grow above 3% and you’ve seen us come in pretty flat the last two years well below to 3% target we set.
Certainly that’s been an important part of our business model providing the opportunity to spend on the growth opportunities we have and you’re going to see us I think very focused on continuing that discipline.
I just want to be a little cautious about setting an exact operating efficiency ratio target.
Okay great thank you.
Thank you.
And next we have Don Vendetti with Citigroup.
Please go ahead.
Yes Jeff I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on when we might hear on the Costco US deal.
And if you could talk a little bit around that how you balance what appear to be sort of lighter economics on these co-brand deals with the potential lumpiness of a loss of a deal how you sort of think through that.
Well I appreciate the question.
Clearly Costco is a very important and long-term partner of ours.
Our U.S.
relationship goes back to the 1990s.
We think we've been great partners and create a lot of value for their members our card members and for both companies.
Now I would point out to you that I don't think we said anything about any ongoing discussions we're having with Costco.
Obviously with very important partners we are always working every day to evolve the relationship to make it better and frankly to make sure it's working for both parties.
You can presume we're doing that with Costco as we're doing it with all of our partners at any time and if and when we have any news as we did with Delta which we chose to renew early we would certainly tell you.
In terms of thinking about the economics of these things you've certainly heard a number of us both Ken and I and some of our colleagues talk about the competitive environment for co-brands in recent months and quarters and that's true.
I think you have to balance those comments with the fact that these are still one of many good economic growth opportunities we have as a Company.
And while yes the environment has become competitive and certainly there are cases where we conclude because we're pretty selective that we think we're better off not either getting into or proceeding with certain kinds of co-brand partnerships because we have so many other opportunities in our proprietary business as a general matter these still are attractive and important parts of our overall business model and when we have great partners where our interests are really aligned and I'll go back to the recent renewals with Delta and Starwood we think we can create great value together and for all parties involved.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Sheryl Tate with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
Hi good afternoon.
Question on the - on U.S.
billed business and clearly lower gas prices have been a bit of a headwind in terms of reduced spend.
Just wondering if you can help think through some of the offsets as to the opportunity clearly with OptBlue and higher merchant acceptance and also if there's - if you're seeing sort of consumer willingness to increase spend in other non-gas related categories as potential offsets as well.
Couple things Sheryl.
For us gas is a relatively modest portion of spend.
It's probably 3% or so or a little under 3 of our spend.
If you look at the quarter it was probably down around 10%.
So there's some impact on our overall billings.
It's fairly modest.
I think given the size of that and the context of our Company it's probably premature or early for us to try to say whether or not there is an offset as consumers and companies take the savings they're getting and spend elsewhere.
It would probably just be hard for us to say given the magnitude of our overall network versus what the spend on gas is.
On OptBlue we've been really pleased since we rolled the plan out early last year with the great acceptance it's gotten in the merchant acquirer world.
We've been very pleased with the progress those acquirers have then made in signing up new merchants.
I would just remind people that as we laid out the plan early last year this is a multiyear effort and we are proceeding really nicely and we are right on track to make very significant strides in merchant coverage over the next couple years.
There's a process of you have to expand the coverage then you have to create awareness with card members and that's why we've always talked about this as a multiyear effort.
We're really pleased by all the early signs on but it's not something that in the fourth quarter I would have expected to have a particularly material impact on the overall billings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets.
Go ahead please.
Hi thank you.
The question I had was just around your provisions for the quarter and Jeff you talked about that a little bit the provision is being a little bit higher than where they've been at and you also talked about some specific provisioning there.
But I'd like to get your view as far as what's going on with the underlying consumer and provisioning trends going forward because you had the lower gas prices presumably they helped consumers a little bit.
I know you target affluent consumers so there's maybe less of a benefit.
But you look at the charge-off rate improvements either the size of the provisioning it seems like we should expect some pretty hefty growth in provisioning looking into 2015.
So if you could just parse the provisioning for us a little bit and your outlook there that would be helpful.
Thank you.
So Sameer gosh when you look at our credit metrics actually are down year-over-year and what we are seeing in write-offs and delinquencies there's really no sign of a tick upwards.
I only of course joined the Company about a year and a half ago and I think I said on every single earnings call that I've done beginning in July of 2013 that well write off rates have to eventually go up but they have not.
With the provision this quarter there's really as I said three things going on.
Number one remember we're growing loans at 7%.
You also just have a seasonal phenomenon because the balances always go up in the December quarter and we do just the way the rules work we do set the reserves up for those balances and often the pattern would be that a little bit of that would roll off as you get into the beginning of next year.
We also just had a few specific reserve items which come and go.
So it's not necessarily indicative of the future going forward.
And we are relative to where we were say a year ago two years ago at a point where we're not further improving the metrics much.
They're fairly flat although they are have improved a little bit.
So it's really those phenomenon that drove this quarter what was a sizable increase in provision at 22% increase in provision.
But I think I'd be cautious about concluding from that that all else being equal without other changes in the environment that you should expect a big jump-up in provision next year.
We'll have to see how the economy develops.
We'll have to see how our metrics develop.
But certainly we don't see in our metrics any sign of the weakening consumer credit environment and gosh when you look at unemployment rates continuing to go down I don't think that should surprise any of us.
Okay thank you.
Thank you we’ll go now to Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities.
Go ahead please.
Thank you.
Good evening.
Jeff can you talk about how the existence of the preferred debt you guys have issued I think you did $750 million in the third quarter better positions you for CCAR this year? And the degree to which you think of it as replacing equity particularly since that prefers capable of absorbing losses under the severely adverse scenario.
So as you - good question Bill.
I think I explained but probably not for quite some time.
When you look at the evolving capital rules it used to be that the tier 1 capital minimums were actually below the Tier 1 common minimums.
We moved into a world where the tier 1 capital minimums are about 150 basis points above your tier 1 common.
So if you're going to try to run the company efficiently and be governed by to your point in the severe scenario what are you going to trip you got to find the most cost efficient way if you will to fill that 150 basis point difference between the tier 1 common and the tier 1 ratio.
And the preferred is clearly for us and for many other banks.
You've seen quite a surge of issuance of these kinds of securities.
That's why we put it into our CCAR 2014 submission last year.
It's why you will see us do another issuance in the first quarter or this quarter and that will bring us about to where we want to be to provide that 150 basis point buffer.
Certainly this is one component among several that we think makes our CCAR submission this year even stronger.
We have built over the past 12 months capital even though we returned a very significant amount of capital to shareholders many we have issued this preferred.
We continue to work on all of the qualitative processes which we think are getting better in providing more insights to us.
So we feel really good about our submission.
All that said we're not the judge the Fed is and we'll have to see where we come out probably towards the latter part of March.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Brad Ball with Evercore ISI.
Please go ahead.
Thanks.
Jeff you mentioned the heightened regulatory challenges and it looks like the EU is close to finalizing its card payment fee caps.
Could you talk about how these new rules will impact your business in Europe and how you plan to adjust AmEx's business there to reflect the changes in the economics of the business? Well as we've commented on for a while we are very very very actively engaged of course with lots of parties across the EU in the ongoing process that will ultimately lead to a finalization of all the new rules.
And I think one thing we've learned is we want to be a little bit cautious until the final final rules are out and all the details spelled out and making any comments on the ultimate impact to us.
All that said I'd make a few general points.
One any regulation even regulation targeted more at the two dominant networks tends to put some pressure even if it's indirect on our business model.
Two we do have a flexible business model and the closed loop gives us some unique ability to operate in a number of ways in response to evolving not just regulatory but competitive and other environments and you've seen us do some of those things in other parts of the world.
Sometimes it takes us some time to evolve the business model.
We'll have to see where the final EU rules come out.
Three I would say there are already some things happening in Europe that are going to have an impact on us even in the near term even though the final payments directive has not been issued and there are some changes in the rules around cross-border acquiring that we think are already and even more so in 2015 will begin to put some pressure on our discount rate in Europe.
And that's just one of the many challenges that I talked about in as I reflected overall on the challenges we have for 2015.
On the broader overall impact for the payments directive we’ll just have to see what the final language shows.
Thank you.
Very helpful.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Hochstim with Buckingham reserve.
Go ahead please.
Thanks.
I wonder since you mentioned your Starwood and Delta co-brands.
Can you give us an update on how large they are as a percentage of loans and/or billed business and I guess could you expand on the negative financial impact that the renewal of those contracts might have? Well we don’t David as you know tend to call out the specific size of any of our portfolios and I would probably include Starwood.
You did several years ago provide those so I didn’t know if maybe you’d be willing to update that.
Yes I don’t think at this point.
Obviously there’s also sense sensitivity with our partners so it’s not something David I want to do on a casual basis.
You are correct from time to time usually at an investor presentation kind of format we have provided a few numbers that we fully vet with the partners bank.
So we’re not prepared to do that today.
Clearly the fact that we have just resigned with Starwood tells you about how pleased we are and I think how pleased they are with the relationship and the growth potential it has going forward.
You talk about the impact.
I guess what I was very much trying to communicate in my comments earlier is that we are in these co-brand relationships for the long term just like we run the Company for the long term.
Often these partnerships only get renewed every quite a number of years.
These are not annual renewals.
So when normal market commission have evolved for quite a number of years when you renew a contract you can sometimes have a significant reset and we always structure these things so both parties have tremendous incentives to continue to grow the value and we’re pretty pleased overall with the role that all these partners have played in our financial performance over the years.
So these latest renewals fall into all of those general fits of experience I just gave you.
No one portfolio that’s the size of star is going to have that material an impact on us but it’s one of the many many factors we look at as we think about both our near term and our longer term financial performance.
Would it be reasonable to expect higher reward cost prospectively with Delta? Well our relationship with Delta is very very complex.
You’ve got a co-brand partnership.
You have their participation in membership rewards.
They’re a very very significant merchant for us.
We have a lounge agreement with them.
We are a huge - I’d remind you we are still 60% owner of the largest business travel operation in the country.
So there are a lot lot lot of moving economic pieces to our relationship with Delta.
So that's why it's such an important relationship to them.
It's why it's such an important relationship to us.
And that's why we think it's so important to get it back in a status where it's been renewed for the longer term and that's where we are now and now we're both just focused on growing the relationship.
I don't want to comment on any specific terms in anyone of the many areas because of course we both look at this relationship and try to balance it across all the many different components.
Thank you.
Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Just I was hoping to get a little bit of an update on a couple of our growth initiatives.
The loyalty partners and if that was getting to a point where it’s material enough to possibly breakout for us and we've been hearing around the market that American Express is getting more active in small business lending and I was wondering if you could talk about that at all those two growth initiatives.
Well we continue to be very pleased by the growth in loyalty partner.
As you recall we launched in Italy late last year - early last year.
It is well into a very mature state in a number of other countries Germany Mexico et cetera.
The growth rates for that business overall are in the high double-digits and we're very pleased and I think you can continue to expect us to expand to new countries.
In terms of breaking it out I think we're still a ways from that.
We will probably somewhat similar to the answer I gave earlier in response to things like Starwood metrics.
We will from time to time usually in an Investor Day kind of setting give people a few metrics but we're really pleased with the business.
And I think it's also fair to say we're also learning because it is a relatively new business for us how to better optimize some of the synergies with our core card business and we're pleased with our progress there.
In fact I talked in my earlier remarks about strong growth in a number of European countries including Germany and one of the factors helping us in Germany are some of the synergies we're beginning to see between our core card business and loyalty partner.
On small business lending we obviously have a tremendous franchise with small businesses.
And we were certainly the first to create an organization within the Company extremely focused on just trying to figure out how do we help drive success across our small business partners and it's given us a tremendous position in the marketplace.
Small business Saturday has been a tremendous add to the overall range of the things we do with small business partners and growing our lending efforts in small business we would see as one of the many opportunities we have to do a little bit more lending than you've seen us do the last few years.
I want to emphasize here that we're a long long ways from doing anything that changes our spend centric focus.
On the other hand with our existing customer base within our existing risk profile with your example of small businesses as a really good example we think we are really well positioned to accelerate growth rates from where we are today and we're very focused on doing it.
Great thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Mike Taiano with Burke &amp; Quick.
Go ahead please.
Great thank you.
Just want to go back to the energy question sort of the drop in oil prices.
The deceleration that you saw in billed business volume in the fourth quarter if there was anything that was noticeable related to any of the energy - the states that are more energy centric like Texas in the fourth quarter.
And then just looking forward sort of how you plan on sort of managing sort of the credit risk of some of those states.
I know back when the housing crisis that you guys were very proactive in trying to rein in credit lines for those that you thought might be more exposed to housing.
Just was curious on your thoughts on that.
That's a great question Mike.
I think in terms of the impact in Q4 on billings by geography billings by industry type as we've begun to scrub through the numbers you really don't see anything that jumps out at you in terms of a pattern but frankly that's not surprising to us because it's still pretty new when you think about Q4.
I think we'll all have to see how things develop in 2015.
I think that also really points to the importance of your second question.
Believe me as you would expect us to be we are being very thoughtful and very focused on both industry and geographic concentrations and trying to be well ahead of anything that does start to appear in terms of how we're managing our credit profile across our business.
Great thank you.
Thank you.
We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
Go ahead please.
Great.
Just back on the Delta you've said that it's - I guess Delta said that they were going to double the benefits from that relationship with American Express to them as part of the new contract.
Is there any way you could size what percentage of your rewards costs relate to that both across the co-brand and the purchase of MR points? I must admit Moshe I missed their double comment but maybe… They did an Investor Day a couple of weeks back in which they said that.
But look they're a great partner for us and as I explained earlier we have a really broad relationship with Delta that cuts across so many parts of both our companies.
It's generated tremendous value for us and it's generated tremendous value for them.
We last renewed it in 2008 and it's now locked in for quite some period of time and we're really pleased with that and we're both very focused on growing the very mutual interest we have in a common card member and flier base.
All that said they're a good partner and I think we've been pretty clear that in general there's a reset often when you do these kinds of renewals after a long time and I said on my earlier remarks Delta is no exception.
You do see the one piece of the economics in the charges we took in Q4.
And that is that there is an impact that caused us to reprice the bank of MR points so that basically tells you we're going to pay Delta a little bit more money when a membership rewards member transfers MR points to redeem a flight on Delta.
That's actually very similar to something we did back in 2008 in fact the charge is almost the same size as something we took back in 2008.
So that's not new.
I think it's just sort of a standard part of the reset.
Beyond that I don't want to try to size the overall economics of a specific agreement as we have with Delta and there's many many ways that they may think about the value so I actually couldn't tell you how they might have gotten to the So is it fair then just to add to that the fact that you've got 5% of your co-brand of your spending volume in the co-brand because that's not part of the MR program.
Right.
That’s a disclosure you made in the 10-K of that 5% of your spend is the Delta co-brand.
Yes you are correct.
And of course we spell that out arises leveled from an SEC perspective we should disclose.
Got it.
Thank you.
Thanks Moshe.
Thank you.
And next we have James Friedman with Susquehanna.
Go ahead please.
I want to ask you about Delta.
No Jamie you can ask about whatever you like.
I was going to ask about GCS.
I was - if you could share with us your perspective about the general competitive environment for corporate cards.
And then in the sales Concur does that change your advantage in that it’s no longer a consolidated asset.
Remember our ownership stake in Concur was about 13% or so.
And then back in 2008 we thought putting in place a series of operating agreements taking that minority of stake.
We did put $1 billion on the board.
It was really a good way to both - make sure we captured the operating synergies between the two companies and we’ve been very successful over the years and helping each other to grow.
Well frankly letting Concur operate as an independent company to really grow and create the value that - they’ve really done a rather remarkable job of with the purchase by SAP.
We are very excited frankly to take that partnership longstanding partnership with Concur and continue it but frankly expanded as they become a part of SAP and we think that’s going to open even more avenues of working together and we’ve - even as you would expect before the acquisition was announced had a number of discussions along those lines.
And so we’re if anything more excited than we were about the ability to continue to work together to help drive both of our businesses forward.
So I think we’re out of time.
Operator so I want to thank everybody for joining us on today’s call and participating in the Q&amp;A.
We are to summarize maybe pleased with the solid performance we showed for the full year of 2014.
We do face increasing challenges in 2015 but we face the challenges from a strong position many growth opportunities and we’re all focused on making sure we’re making the right decisions to position the company for the long-term.
So with that I wish you all good evening.
Thanks for your continued interest in American Express.
Thank you.
And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference.
You may now disconnect.

I’d now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr.
Rick Petrino.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you and welcome.
We appreciate everybody joining us for today’s call.
The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company’s other reports already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2015 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter’s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed.
Once Jeff completes his remarks we will move to a Q&amp;A session.
With that let me turn it over to Jeff.
Well thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone.
Overall Q1 was a solid quarter for the Company consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at Investor Day last month.
The quarter reflected solid core underlying performance as well as several discrete impacts including the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar and various changes to our cobrand relationships.
As you recall we discussed at Investor Day our expectations for the first quarter and in fact EPS growth of 11% did come in better than our full-year outlook and even a little better than we thought a few weeks ago in part due to the timing of our incremental spending on growth initiatives which will ramp up over the course of the year along with some other timing benefits that we don’t expect to repeat as we go through the year.
I’ll discuss these items in more detail later in my remarks.
Importantly for these reasons our full-year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking back to the financial outlook framework from Investor Day our core underlying performance remains consistent and continued to be driven by solid revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and business travel revenues in the prior year disciplined cost controls and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.
Our results also reflect some of the discrete impacts that we discussed a few weeks ago.
In the cobrand space we are seeing the impact from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada as well as the reset impact from the early renewals we have done with several other cobrand partners including Delta Starwood and Cathay Pacific.
In addition the U.S.
dollar continued to strengthen during the first quarter and represented a significant headwind to our quarterly earnings performance.
Importantly during the quarter we also continued to have strong momentum on key initiatives highlights included the expansion of our small merchant coverage through OptBlue the announcement of the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the U.S.
the signing of the new Charles Schwab cobrand along with the renewal of our cobrand relationship with British Airways in Iberia as well as the announcement just today of our new wearable payments partnership with Jawbone.
We were also very pleased by our strong 2015 CCAR performance which will provide us with the flexibility to increase our dividend and share repurchases going forward.
As we discussed at Investor Day we believe that these developments are indicative of the many attractive opportunities for growth as we have over the longer-term.
So that is the quarter and a simple summary.
So we get into the detail I will warn you that lasting the impact the 2014’s Global Business Travel and Concur transactions along with the 2015 discrete impact of FX and our cobrand changes all combined to make understanding our results this year a bit more complex than usual.
To begin now with our financial results for Q1 as you can see on slide two reported billings growth was 3%.
Like many other global companies the strength of the U.S.
dollar had a significant impact on our growth rates this quarter.
As the dollar continued to strengthen the magnitude of the FX impact increased and for the first quarter depressed our growth by nearly four percentage points.
As a result FX adjusted billings growth was 7% significantly higher than our reported rate.
I’ll provide more details on our billings performance shortly but lower gas prices in the U.S.
and the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada clearly had an impact on our results.
Reported revenue growth of negative 3% was of course also impacted by FX as well as the inclusion of business travel revenues in the prior year.
Excluding these items adjusted revenue growth was 5% consistent with both the prior quarter and recent trends.
Net income grew by 6% helped by disciplined expense control and lower provision costs both of which also reflected some timing benefits in the quarter which helped to offset the discrete impacts of FX and the changes in our cobrand relationships.
Below the net income line we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders.
Over the past year we have repurchased 48 million shares which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding.
This declined in shares outstanding along with the modestly lower tax rate drove the 11% diluted EPS growth that we generated during the first quarter.
This performance also resulted in an ROE of 29% for the period ending March 31 well above or on average and over time target of 25% and demonstrates the continued strength of our business model.
Let’s now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the first quarter starting with billed business on slide three.
On an FX adjusted basis billings growth slowed modestly from 8% in Q4 to 7% during the quarter.
Looking at the results by segment in our U.S.
consumer and small segment growth also decelerated slightly to 7% in Q1.
This performance was impacted by the more than 30% decline in gas prices year-over-year as well as slower retail sales growth consistent with industry wide trends in the U.S.
I would note that in the U.S.
we did not see any material impact on our billings growth from the announced termination next year of our relationship with Costco.
As you would have expected however we have started to see some slowing of new Costco cobrand card acquisitions which along with any future customer behavior changes that we may experience will likely begin to impact our performance somewhat later this year.
It’s also worth noting on billings that the deceleration in Q1 was more pronounced in our GCS segment or billings were up 4% on an FX adjusted basis as we seem to see a slowdown in spending across a number of corporate customers primarily in the U.S.
GNS continues to be our strongest billings growth segment with FX adjusted growth of 16% during the quarter.
This continued strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model given the much higher than company average returns on equity we achieved in the GNS business.
Finally ICS FX adjusted growth was 2% during Q1 but as we began to see last quarter we saw very different trends by region as you can see on slide four.
The slowdown in international regions came primarily from LACC where volumes were down 4% versus the prior year driven by a drop-off in Canadian billings.
As you recall we began to see volume slow in Canada during Q4 when card acceptance at Costco in Canada was expanded to include other networks.
Beginning January 1st American Express products were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada and we are now seeing that full impact from the termination of this relationship on billed business.
In contrast to LACC we saw improved growth in the JAPA region which was again the fastest growing region in the quarter up 16% on an FX adjusted basis.
This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan.
In all international regions you see that like other U.S.
companies with a significant global footprint our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates.
To provide you with some additional perspective here on slide five we have again included a comparison of our reported and FX adjusted revenue growth rates for the last eight quarters.
As you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on this slide our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with the recent trends in the 5% range.
However during the first quarter foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our results than in prior periods driving adjusted revenue growth down by nearly four percentage points.
At current FX rates we would expect to see a similar drag in the second quarter.
As you can see in the second row the bottom of the chart the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S.
Now of course this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies but there is a bottom-line impact especially when rates move this dramatically.
Over the longer term we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model.
As we discussed at Investor Day however if the current rates hold FX will continue to have a significant discrete impact for the balance of the year.
Turning now to loans you see on slide six that worldwide loans were up 4% versus the prior year.
Consistent with historical seasonal trends we did see a drop-off in loan balances versus year-end and a small sequential increase in net interest yield during the first quarter.
In the U.S.
which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio growth was relatively consistent to the prior quarter at 7%.
On the international side reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and the decline in loans related to the Costco Canada cobrand portfolio.
Stepping back our loan growth has consistently been above the industry over the past two years.
And we talked at Investor Day about the opportunity to continue the strength by growing share with existing card members as well as attracting new customers to our franchise.
Having said this however I’d also remind you that net interest income this quarter still made up only 18% of our total revenues.
And given the expected run-off in loans associated with the Costco U.S.
cobrand portfolio next year even if we continue to grow our core loan portfolio with the higher rates we have seen our overall business model will remain very spend focused.
So now putting together our billings and loan performance you see on slide seven that revenues declined 3% on reported basis but increased by 5% after adjusting for FX and business travel revenues in the prior year.
I’ll note that revenue growth during the current quarter does reflect a portion of the negative impact from our cobrand partnership early renewals as well as a larger impact versus Q4 from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada.
Even with these discrete impacts however adjusted revenue growth of 5% is consistent with recent trend illustrating the ongoing strength of our underlying core business.
The two largest components of revenue are of course discount revenue and net interest income.
To start with the former during the first quarter discount revenue grew by 1% which was approximately 200 basis points below the reported growth in billed business of 3%.
The first driver of this difference was a decline in our reported discount rate which was down 2 basis points versus the prior year.
This year-over-year decline is slightly smaller than in recent quarters in part because the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume where we earned a much slower discount rate actually raises the company average discount rate.
The discount rate also reflects continued growth in our OptBlue program as merchant acquirers actively sign up new merchants onto the American Express network.
As Ed discussed at Investor Day 14 of the top 15 merchant acquirers in the U.S.
are now part of OptBlue.
Last year when Anre Williams introduced this new program to you at the February financial community meeting he said that we expect to increase our small merchant acquisition by 50% and more for the next several years starting in 2015.
And while this is obviously a multiyear effort we in fact signed more than 400 000 new small merchants last year in 2014.
So we are clearly off to a good start.
We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world.
Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was faster growth in both GNS volumes and the Concur revenue items including cash incentives and certain payments related to our renewed cobrand relationships.
Turning to the other key component of revenue net interest income we saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding cost.
As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S.
the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income and on other revenue lines.
Moving now to credit performance on slide eight.
You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels and that our write-off and delinquency rates both remained relatively consistent with recent trends.
As you can see on slide nine despite this steady lending credit performance provision expense dropped 13% versus the prior year.
Typically we experienced the reserve release during Q1 due to the seasonal decline in loans and receivable balances versus year end.
The increase in the reserve release versus the prior year is largely to due to charge cards with the prior year period included a modest reserve build.
Moving to our lending reserve coverage levels on slide 10 coverage remained relatively consistent after considering the impact of the seasonal decline in loans and receivables I just mentioned.
We believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Thinking about the balance of the year it is important to note that we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance.
Therefore we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and to represent a headwind to growth for the remainder of 2015.
Moreover as we discussed at Investor Day we did build into our multiyear financial outlook and assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving below revenue now to expenses on slide 11.
On a reported basis expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year.
Excluding business travel expenses incurred in 2014 adjusted total expenses increased by 1% and also of course benefitted somewhat from the strength of the U.S.
dollar.
I’ll come back to operating expenses in marketing and promotion at a knock.
First however I’ll touch on a few other items on this slide.
Rewards expense grew by 4% which was relatively consistent with our reported billed business growth.
And rewards expense in the current quarter does include a portion of the discreet impact from our renewed cobrand relationships.
The resultant increase in our rewards costs however was partially offset by some timing benefits this quarter related to our membership rewards program.
Next while it’s a relatively small percentage of total expenses cost of card member services increased significantly year-over-year by 18%.
As background a portion of the expenses in this line are related to the payments we may provide partners for services such as baggage fees companion tickets and airport lounge access which have increased as a result of our renewed cobrand relationships.
For the remainder of 2015 given the Q1 of last year also included elevated costs in cost of card member services we would expect to see an even higher level of growth for this line item.
Lastly on slide 11 the tax rate during the first quarter was 34% which was relatively consistent with recent quarters but slightly below the prior year.
As we mentioned at Investor Day our assumption is that the tax rate will remain roughly in line with recent performance during 2015.
Let’s turn now to marketing and promotion expenses which accounts for the majority of our spending on growth initiatives.
Slide 12 shows the trend of these costs.
And you see that while this quarter’s marketing and promotion expenses were 4% higher than the prior year you’ll also notice that these costs have historically been much slower during each year’s first quarter.
More broadly as we think about 2015 we continue to evolve our plans around the timing and level of incremental spending on growth initiatives.
As we have said the majority but not all of this spending will occur in marketing and promotion.
Considering this we would expect marketing and promotion expenses to be relatively similar with the elevated levels of 2014 which you can see on the slide included higher levels of expenses in Q2 when we have the business travel joint venture transaction gain and in Q4 when we had the Concur gain.
While we could have made the decision to reduce investments from their elevated 2014 levels as we discussed at Investor Day we believe that the right decision for shareholders to best position the Company for the medium to long-term is to keep investments at an elevated level this year in anticipation of the termination of our relationship with Costco in the U.S.
during early 2016.
As Ken Ed and Steve discussed in detail a few weeks ago the incremental spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we see across all segments in our Company including our efforts to capture a meaningful portion of the spend and lend of our Costco card members in the U.S.
Turning now to operating expense performance on slide 13 our reported results continue to reflect the impact of business travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories complicating line by line comparisons.
That said excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 2% in the quarter.
I’ll also note that during the quarter we benefited from some specific items in the other net line which we do not expect to repeat going forward.
As you think about the balance of the year I’d also point out that operating expenses have historically been lower during Q1.
Moving to slide 14 adjusted operating expense growth of course remained well below our stated 3% growth target.
As we discussed at Investor Day maintaining disciplined control of our expense particularly operating expenses remains a key driver of our earnings performance.
As Steve noted that day however we are not achieving this disciplined expense controls or a cutback in investment levels but rather to ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization we continue to make substantial investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives.
Now shifting to our capital performance on slide 15.
During the current quarter we returned 65% of the capital we generated to shareholders while strengthening our already strong capital ratios.
As I mentioned at Investor Day share repurchases of approximately $750 million for the first quarter were below the amount included in our 2014 CCAR submission due to some nuances in 2014 CCAR rules associated with the capital generated by employee plan.
These rules have evolved for future CCAR periods but did cause our Q1 payout ratio to be somewhat lower than in recent quarters.
I also point out that the 2015 CCAR process gives all participants more flexibility on the timing of share repurchases across the five-quarter CCAR approval period.
Accordingly the exact timing and size of our repurchases in 2015 will be driven by many factors including but not limited to the levels of our earnings and the demand for other capital uses.
Looking at our capital ratios on the bottom of the slide you see a more significant increase year-over-year in our Tier 1 capital ratio.
This was driven by the $1.6 billion in preferred issuances we executed during the last two quarters.
As a reminder we will see the EPS impact from the dividend payments associated with these issuances beginning in Q2.
These payments will reduce our net income available to common shareholders by approximately $20 million each quarter.
Stepping back from these quarterly results our strong relative performance in the 2015 CCAR process and the Fed’s non-objection to our capital plan clearly illustrates the strength of our capital position and business model.
This reinforces our confidence in the Company’s ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength.
And we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
Before moving on to your questions let me make just a few final comments.
Stepping away from the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results we believe that our core underlying performance this quarter was solid and reflected the continued strength of our business model and the trends we discussed last month at Investor Day.
Earnings per share growth of 11% was better than our full year 2015 outlook in part due to some specific benefits in Q1 most notably in provision and operating expenses and also because we have not yet seen a ramp up in incremental spending on growth initiatives.
Clearly given our 11% EPS growth in Q1 simple math would indicate that EPS growth would have to be negative for the balance of year to meet our continued outlook for full-year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking at the second quarter in particular I would remind you that you will begin to see the impact from our recent preferred share issuances and that the prior year EPS of the $1.43 included in that benefit from the business travel joint venture transaction considering this while it is obliviously very early in the quarter we would expect earnings per share in Q2 to be more significantly down from last year.
All this is consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance would be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period.
Given this dynamic our focus has been on our full year earnings outlook rather than our performance in any individual quarter.
When we consider our Q1 performance and our Q2 comments in the context of the multiyear financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day we believe we are on track and are continuing to do the right things to position the Company for the long-term.
With that I’ll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&amp;A session.
Thanks Jeff.
As a reminder in order to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the call I will ask that those in the queue please limit yourself to just one question.
Thanks for your cooperation in this process.
And with that operator let’s open up the lines for questions.
Thank you.
And we’ll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Thank you.
I guess my question will be on Costco Canada.
I know you guys have addressed it throughout the last couple of times you’ve spoken.
But now that you have a full quarter’s worth of experience at Costco Canada could you maybe just talk about you know your ability to retain spending on those customers’ cards and how you think it reflects relative to your strategy in the U.S.? Thanks.
Thanks Sanjay for the question.
Maybe let me start by providing just a little bit of context for Canada because we’ve given a fairly unusual amount of color around the U.S.
where we pointed out that that relationship consists of about 70% of the cobrand spend being out of store also talked about the cobrand in the U.S accounting for about 8%of global billings.
To draw a contrast to Canada in Canada the Costco cobrand and Costco as a merchant represented a more significant portion of our country total billings in Canada.
The other probably two very important differences to point out to you are that the portion of spend on the Costco Canada cobrand that was in store was much higher it was about 60% in store and of course in Canada there was no sale of the portfolio.
So with all that as context you are correct that this is the first full quarter since the termination of acceptance of Amex products in Canada on January 1st.
As you would expect that means all of the in store spend goes away.
But we while it’s still early I would say continue to be pleased as you now heard us say in a couple forums by our efforts to capture the spend and lend of the Canadian Costco card members.
And of course in Canada we did issue a new cash back card.
As you would expect we are very focused on those customers who clearly have an affinity with the American Express brand.
And I’d say there have been significant learnings and we are encouraged by them and we are being very thoughtful about how we will apply them in the U.S.
As you would expect Sanjay I probably don’t want to provide a lot of color and detail beyond that general statement but we are encouraged on quarter end.
[Operator Instructions].
The next question will come from Don Vendetti with Citigroup.
Yes Jeff I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about a potential gain from the Costco sale.
I mean sometimes these portfolios can trade for 15% plus premiums.
And can you talk about some of the offsets and how that may also impact your capital return given that you’re able to return more than 100% in the CCAR? Couple of comments I really in terms of the progress potential outcome Don on any portfolio sale I can’t really comment beyond what we’ve already said which is we’ll just have to see -- there’s a process and we’ll see how it plays out.
In terms of the financial outlook we have provided I would remind everyone that we did not include any assumption about a gain on the sale of the portfolio.
So any gain would be incremental to the outlook we laid out.
When you think about capital implications obviously if there is a portfolio sale there’s a significant reduction in risk weighted assets that’s the Costco U.S.
loan portfolio as we previously talked about constituted about 20% of our global loan portfolio.
That in and of itself depending upon how quickly we ramp our efforts elsewhere to replace that spend that of course frees up some capital.
And to the extent there is a sale and there is a gain I think it’s fair to say that we’d have to look at the timing and amount of any gain and think about what portion of it we might want to use to make sure we’re fully funding our efforts to capture the future spend and lend from our relationships with the Costco card members and what portion should drop to the bottom line.
Clearly we have a very strong balance sheet already.
And I think we’ve demonstrated a very strong and steady commitment to using that balance sheet to return capital to shareholders.
It’s also fair to say though that the nature and timing of the CCAR process means there is often a lag between big developments that impact capital and our ability to run them through the CCAR process.
So we’ll kind have to see how this plays out.
But hopefully that gives you a sense Don of how we’re thinking about the various components.
And our next question will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.
Good afternoon.
Can we talk about the expense ramp in specifically what areas you’re investing particularly as we saw in the second quarter and maybe this quarter as well? And how are they different than some of the areas that you have invested in previous years and in particular coalition partners and do you expect the Costco USA build to accelerate towards the end of the year versus the middle part of the year.
Good question David.
Let me make a few comments.
One of the reasons why we have continued to talk a little bit about an expectation that you will see more quarterly unevenness in our earnings is we think the prudent thing here is to be a little flexible around the timing at amounts that we choose to spend around one of the things that we will be ramping our growth spending initiative our growth initiative spending on and that’s focusing on the capturing a future spend and lend from our relationship with Costco card members.
It’s very complex process between now and 2016 that will play out in that relationship.
And we need a little bit of flexibility that will determine when we choose to ramp up some of our marketing efforts and when we do.
Certainly that is one of the elements though when you think about what is different this year potentially next year about the range of things that we do growth spending on.
We have a very rich pool of very dedicated American Express card members and we will do our best to capture their future spend and lend.
The second thing I might point out for 2015 is we are very excited about the launch of Plenti since you brought coalition.
As you would imagine or as you recall we have a pretty well drawn track with the loyalty coalition business as we’ve launched that in other countries for understanding the flows from the first year of launch which is more of an investment year and has as the program that matures in the coming years.
So it’s fair to say that we want to make sure this is a really strong launch and we’re putting a lot of resource towards that in 2015.
And that’s probably a little different in terms of the profile that you would have seen last year and a little different than what you will see next year as the progress moves beyond the launch phase.
Beyond those two things I would say really that we will be investing in the range of growth opportunities we have across the Company; we tried to do a pretty thorough overview of those at Investor Day and really expand the Company.
So you’ll see us continue to invest in some of the international markets where we’ve seen particularly high rates of growth.
Basically you’ll see us continue to invest around our small business and middle market efforts.
You will see us continue to invest in some of the areas where we believe expanding the breadth of the demographic that our brand reaches out to is producing new opportunities and you will see us continue to do some things that we think will drive the steady growth in lending that you’re seeing above industry averages.
So that’s probably how we think about the spending overall.
And our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Good evening Jeff.
Could you clarify for us what cost of equity or hurdle rate you use when evaluating new investment opportunities? And can you also discuss how your hurdle rates might differ across your different businesses including for example cobrand particularly since it seems like your GNS and charge card businesses generate structurally higher returns and are big driver of that 25% plus return target that you have? I don’t think you guys have discussed that in the past but I do think it could be helpful to the extent you can give some kind of indication would be helpful for investors to assess the risk that people have been worried about that you could lose continue to lose future partnerships to competitors who are willing to accept lower returns? Bill that’s a good and actually very important question.
So we have a range of businesses across American Express and of course we have a fairly unique business model in our core business.
That range of businesses and that business model produce a tremendous return on equity relative to most of our peers in financial services.
And so we are thrilled that we have an ROE which this quarter was 29% and we have really strong track record in meeting our more than 25% target.
And I think it’s a real commentary on the strength of more business model.
But we shouldn’t confuse that with hurdle rates for incremental investments or for how we think about bidding for business.
Because of course if we really look at our cost of capital you will of course get to numbers far far below 25%.
And I can spend the rest of the call getting philosophical but exactly how you might calculate our cost of capital when we look at it as you would expect in many ways but suffices to say it is much below 25% and it is somewhere around the 10% range depending on which measure you want to look at.
And when we are thinking about incremental opportunities in a bidding situation I don’t really believe that we would take a different economic choice based strictly on a hurdle rate.
Now we do make choices based on the next part of your question though which is we do have a range of opportunities in our business.
And we generate a range of returns on equity and a range of returns on an incremental dollar of expense spending as well.
And so when we think about opportunities we’re always making sure that anything we do is going to generate incremental value for our shareholders and be above our returns on capital but we also have to think about the range of opportunities in the financial and managerial resources that we have to allocate across those opportunities.
And one of the things you heard us talk a fair amount about going all the way back to the February 2012 investor call that Ken and I had on Costco is as we thought about where we were with Costco one of the things we really thought about was the range of other opportunities we have; some of the non-financial constraints that a future contract might have entailed.
And when we baked all of those things together we came to the conclusion that in a long run we would be better off pursuing another path.
But I think it would be a real misnomer for anyone to conclude from that that oh! American Express is never going to pursue a transaction or piece of business that has a return on equity below 25% so they are not competitive.
Our job is to create value for our shareholders.
And of course I’d like to create it at the highest possible ROE and I’d like to create it in the highest possible parts of our business.
But if I can create a new chunk of business at something that is closer to our hurdle rate we will absolutely of course pursue that business if it’s the best alternative in the long run for the company.
And the next question will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery.
Hi thank you.
My question was about your loss provisions and the reserve release.
Jeff you provided a bit of an explanation.
I think you talked about the provisioning the reserve release being more related to charge cards I think this quarter if I heard you correctly.
But it just seems like between last quarter and this quarter there seem to be a lot more volatility than we’ve seen I think at least in recent quarters; recent years between Q4 and Q1.
So were there any changes made to any underlying assumptions that would drive this kind of volatility? So if you could just parse that out a little bit that would be helpful.
It’s a very accurate description Sameer I think of where we are in the last couple of quarters.
I would have to call this quarter’s provision one that is certainly off the normal trend.
I talked in my remarks about the fact that of course you have a normal Q4 to Q1 decline in your loan and receivable balances and that does generally drive a seasonal therefore decline in your reserves and that happened this year as it did last year.
However you have a combination of the fact that last year’s first quarter had a few various more specific items that happen to drive that number up; a little bit this quarter we had some of the kind of specific adjustments for items that you have every quarter in the provision that happen to drive it down a little bit.
You put those two together and you suddenly get a really big year-over-year difference.
I think the more which is why I also in my remarks tried to point people to I think the more important thing to think about here is as we look at the rest of 2015 in the current economic environment we expect layoff trends to stay pretty strong.
However we’ve been steadily growing our loan balances and you would expect reserves to build along with those loan balances.
And some of these specific items that drove the Q1 results we wouldn’t necessarily expect to repeat.
So you put all that together and I would expect to see provision going up year-over-year in 2015.
And I would also just remind you that in terms of what assumptions we made in the financial outlook we’ve given for 2016 and 2017 we did assume in 2016 and 2017 that you do see some modest uptick in write-off rates and hence provision and reserves.
The next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
Please go ahead.
Jeff can you just clarify in terms of the ‘16 broad guidance that you gave back in February and related at the recent Investor Day does it contemplate the foregone net interest income from a sale of Costco portfolio that’s really I suppose? That’s a good question Eric.
And what I would say is that because we can’t be completely sure of the timing and outcome of any potential portfolio sale we built an outlook for 2016 which we think we can achieve under a range of potential outcomes for the portfolio.
And we’ve built an outlook that to be exclusive does not include any potential gain on a sale.
So we think as a matter what assumption you might want to make about the resolution around the portfolio we think we have enough levers in our business to hit the outlook we’ve given for 2016.
Now certainly there are some things that could drive you above that.
If there is a gain on a sale for example that is clearly not in our outlook and would be incremental but we just don’t know enough about the final outcome and the timing of the final outcome to be specific beyond the comments I just made.
And the next question will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley.
Just wanted to touch on billed business a little bit and if we can split it up into international and U.S.
On the international side I was just wondering if you could maybe spend a minute on how you think about potential hedging strategies to help offset some of the headwinds.
And then on the U.S.
side if you could provide a bit of color for how you’re thinking about trends as we look at the rest of 2015 and on top of that potential to maybe take some share with OptBlue similarly tracking a bit ahead of expectations? Thank you.
Let me take those one at a time Cheryl.
On hedging so we do some foreign exchange hedging but it’s really about frankly helping us have a clear view from a planning perspective within a quarter.
It helps us know what the FX impact is going to be.
In essence at the beginning of a quarter we do a bunch of hedging that unwind as you get to the end of the quarter.
So you’re not further impacted by anything that happens in the quarter.
That obviously has zero impact on our longer trend or on the year-over-year declines.
And as we think about doing any other kind of strategy longer term to hedge our conclusion at the end of the day is that we think there is value in the diverse set of global businesses we have we think in the long run; the currencies go up and down and tend to equilibrate over time and that the frictional costs and frankly the volatility that the accounting drives for any longer term hedging strategy has caused us to shy away from it.
So that’s how we think about hedging.
On the U.S.
obviously we’ll have to see where the economy goes as we get into the rest of the year.
I think it’s fair to say from our experience in the first quarter we haven’t started to see estimates of GDP growth in the U.S.
or elsewhere but I think when we look at our own experience and some of the external data around retail sales and we look at what’s happening to gas prices when we look at some of the immediately somewhat anecdotal stories we hear in our corporate card business it suggests to us that it was certainly not the most robust of quarters for economic growth.
So really in that environment for us to want to adjust for FX in last year’s business travel get to 5% revenue growth we actually feel pretty good about.
When you think about the rest of the year you’re correct.
I mean we’re up about OptBlue; it is a multiyear effort.
I want to be clear that when Anre Williams on our team first talked about it at the February financial community meeting last year we talked about it in the context of sort of 2015 to 2017.
In that vein we are encouraged that we actually signed up 400 000 merchants in 2014 and that was sort of before we told you we start to ramp the program much.
So we do think as we get into the latter part of 2015 that we should begin to see a meaningful benefit from OptBlue and we remain very encouraged by it.
We obviously remain very encouraged by lots of other things in the market.
Our steady growth in the U.S.
of growing our lend portfolio we expect to be able to continue and we think we’re doing that without materially changing the risk profile of Company by really focusing on capturing a fairer share of our card member spend.
We’re excited about our continued efforts around broadening the reach of the brand with things like the everyday card and we’re excited about things like Plenti.
And if you haven’t focused on it I’ll point out to you we are going to launch a Plenti cobrand which we think will be a very interesting play as just one more step on our pathway of broadening the demographic reach of the brand and the franchise.
So we’ll have to see where the economy goes and what the environment does but those are probably some of the things we’re thinking about as we look at the rest of the year.
And our next question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous.
Good evening.
Just a fast question the sharp decline or not the sharp decline but slowing in commercial card spend; if you could first tell us where or in what parts of the economy you’re seeing that weakness most clearly? And secondly historically in talking to Amex we’ve discussed corporate spend trends leading consumer spend trends by about six months.
Do you still think of that as a good relationship that the slowdown in commercial could be forecasting a slowdown in consumer toward the back half of the year? Thanks.
Well it’s a good question Craig.
Let me just remind everyone of the facts.
So what it does to us as well strike us is that in the corporate card segment you saw a sequential slowing from 8% in Q4 to 4% in Q1 and that’s clearly a much sharper sequential slowing that you’ve seen elsewhere.
As we have dug into that a little bit it is primarily driven by the U.S.
and seems to be a little bit more striking in our larger accounts in the U.S.
In terms of what this means for the broader economy six months from now I guess I’d be cautious.
One if you look at corporate spending it tends to be a little more volatile than some of our other segments because companies who’ve gotten pretty good over the years are turning on and off their travel spends and other T&amp;E spend in response to their own business challenges in all sense of the economic environment.
I think in any part of our business we are always cautious about saying just one quarter makes a trend.
So we’ll have to see.
I guess I’d say it’s a note of caution for us but I wouldn’t want to read too much into it at this point in time.
And our next question will come from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.
Craig actually just asked my question but I’d love to get a little bit more of a specific answer.
You defined where the slowdown was in terms of size of the customer but I think what I’m interested in and I suspect Craig was as well is there any industry that we can specifically look to; I think everybody’s sort of wondering about oil and gas and also any category of spend where you saw it particularly? Those are good questions Rick and ones believe me we’ve been asking ourselves.
So maybe I’ll even take this opportunity to step back a little bit.
Certainly we are watching very closely across our global portfolio for any impact to both billings and credit arising from the rather dramatic drop in oil prices.
And what I would tell you for now is certainly we see the billings impact to the drop in oil prices; remember it’s 2% to 3% of our billings so 30% drop costs about 1 point of billings growth.
We do see some drop in spend from some of the oil services companies in the grand scheme of our overall billings.
However that did not total up to anything that is significant for us.
We have not seen any significant deterioration in credit yet either by industry or parts of the U.S.
or parts of the globe that are particularly driven by an oil economy but believe me we’re watching all of that like a hawk.
It’s also difficult for us to say whether people taking their monies their savings from slightly lower oil prices and using it to spur more spending elsewhere that’s tough for us to see.
I’m not saying it’s not happening but not sure we can really see any of it.
So to come all the way back to the origin of your question which is what’s driving the sharper sequential decline in corporate card I think we’ve done enough work to say it doesn’t appear to be isolated to oil service doesn’t appear to be isolated to any particular industry or geography with any fire point than it is primarily U.S.
not in other parts of the world.
And our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Good afternoon Jeff.
Hi Ryan.
So I just wanted to ask you one quick question regarding loan growth.
You made the comment that you could have some slower growth related to Costco; your growth has been running into the 4%-5% range.
Just want to get a sense given the efforts that you’re putting into this from a growth perspective we’ve seen some across the industry have accelerating growth rates.
And I was just wondering given the focus here should we expect that we could actually start to see growth rates across the lending area accelerating or do you think the offsets from run-off in Costco are going to overtake the incremental growth that you’re seeing in the rest of portfolio? Well I think I might break the answer Ryan into three components so we think about this.
Talk a little bit about U.S.; talk a little bit about international; and then separately talk about Costco.
Because in the U.S.
in fact our loan growth is close to 7% and has been running up at the 6% to 7% rate for the last couple of quarters.
And I would say that if you look at the kinds of things that Ed in particular talked about at Investor Day this is an area where we think we could run that number also little higher than that in the current industry environment without any material change in our risk profile by continuing to build from a marketing perspective new customers as well as within existing customers both bringing or borrowing focus customers as well capture more of our preferred share of the borrowing behavior of our existing customers.
We are pretty upbeat about that and think it’s a real opportunity for the Company.
Internationally we have a much much smaller loan portfolio.
We do think we can achieve steady growth that’s masked right now by the very significant foreign exchange impacts you see and the fact that and this comes in our third point there was a loan portfolio associated with Costco Canada.
While we didn’t sell the portfolio as you would expect because as I said earlier in response to question because 60% of the spend on it Canadian Costco cobrand using store as that spend run away January 1 you see a more rapid decline in some of the loan balances as well and so that will drag on the international piece a little bit.
The third component to think about is Costco in the U.S.
So we can’t be sure of the outcome of any potential sale of the portfolio but that portfolio if were to be sold represents 20% of our loan.
So you could accelerate your growth excluding that by significant amount from 7%; it’s still going to take you a long time frankly to get back to even where we are today in terms of the overall loan portfolio and what that means for the spend centricity if you will of our overall income statement.
So long winded answer to your question but I think you do have to think about loan growth in the context of those three categories.
So I think we have time for one last question operator.
Thank you.
And that will come from line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
I just want to focus little more on small business and maybe how the lending growth in small business and OptBlue how that’s tying together.
I mean every merchant acquirer talks positively but OptBlue and one of them talk about moving it into Canada.
You said Jeff earlier that you’re moving in something similar in related markets.
The investor meeting you had you showed the merchant loan portfolio growing from almost nothing to 500 million over the last couple of years.
So how was that tying together? Do you expect to grow the loan portfolio along with OptBlue; is that part of the strategy? And will that be not only in the U.S.
but in another markets? And is there any way to quantify in some way the incremental effect that you think that will have on spend growth or loan growth? Bob that’s a good question that’s a series of questions Bob.
And in some way that is the way I would tie together my answer is to say remember one of the aspects of our unique close look model is we work extremely hard every day not just to generate value for our card memories but we work extremely hard every day to see how we generate more value for our merchants.
We are very excited about the OptBlue program and we think it is making it easier for smaller merchants to work with us.
We think it’s going to expand their business opportunities.
And we’re very excited about what it will do for merchant coverage over the next few years.
We do lots of things to try to help small businesses operate better.
When you look at our open business which on the issuing side target small businesses it’s really all about helping drive the success of those businesses and giving them access to spend capacity that our business model and our charge card model really is able to fairly uniquely provide them.
And we really try to use that and have used it over the years to drive to a very significant position with small businesses.
And we do like small business pattern another example of what we do to help try value and support for our merchants.
Merchant financing in that context is just another extension of the same driver.
We have to constantly work at how do we find new ways to add value to merchants very excited about merchant financing and we think it is not only a good opportunity for us to in a very thoughtful measured risk profile centered way grow our financing portfolio we think it’s a real value add for our partners particularly some of our smaller business partners.
So hopefully that strategy all fits together; it’s really part of what we have to do every day.
So with that I would like to thank you all for joining tonight’s call and participating in the Q&amp;A session.
I would summarize by coming back to the fact that we think our results in the first quarter reflect solid core underlying performance.
When you think about our Q1 performance and what I said today about Q2 and when you think about it in the context of the multiyear financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day we think we’re on track and we’re continuing to do the right things to position the Company for the long term.
So with that I wish all of you a good evening.
And I’m going to turn it back over to Rick who is going to provide a brief overview of the investor conferences we plan to participate in during the second quarter.
Rick? Thanks Jeff.
So yes before we close I just want to mention that we are speaking at a number of conferences this quarter.
First our CEO Ken Chenault will be participating in the Bernstein Strategic Decision’s Conference in New York on May 28; then the President of our Global Network and International Card Services Business Doug Buckminster will be at the William Blair Growth Conference in Chicago on June 9th; and then on June 10th American Express President Ed Gilligan will be at the Morgan Stanley Financial Conference here in New York.
Live audio webcast of each of these events will be made available to the general public through the American Express Investor Relations website at ir.amerianexpress.com.
Thanks again for joining tonight’s call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express.
That does conclude the conference for today.
Thanks for participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference service.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call.
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.
Later there will an opportunity for your questions.
[Operator Instructions].
As a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Toby Willard.
Please go ahead.
Welcome.
We appreciate all of you joining us for today’s call.
The discussions today contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company’s other reports already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2015 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some key points related to the quarter’s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed.
Once Jeff completes his remarks we will move to a Q&amp;A session.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.
Well thanks Toby and good afternoon everyone.
Overall our third quarter performance was in line with our 2015 financial outlook and reflected the headwinds that we’ve been managing throughout 2015 during a challenging economic competitive and regulatory environment.
Consistent with the expectations that we discussed publicly in mid-September reported Q3 EPS of $1.24 was down 11% versus the prior year.
And on an FX suggested basis we did see a modest slowing sequentially in the billings growth rate from 6% to 5% and saw adjusted revenue growth slow from 5% in Q2 to 3% in Q3.
As in the first two quarters of 2015 our third quarter results continued to reflect the discreet impacts from various changes to certain of our co-brand partnerships and a significantly stronger U.S.
dollar versus last year both of which I’ll quantify later in my remarks.
The decline in earnings versus the prior year was also in part driven by increased spending on growth initiatives.
I’d remind you that as we considered earlier this year the implications of the pending termination in 2016 of our relationship with Costco in the U.S.
we made the decision to increase spending in 2015 across a range of business opportunities to best position the company for long term growth.
While our reported results reflect the discrete impacts our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth strong card member and merchant acquisitions write off rates at historically low levels disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position.
Through all of this we continued to drive an ROE above our on average and overtime target of 25% demonstrating the continued strength of our business model.
As we turn to the slides we are once again beginning our presentation with the financial outlook framework that we first shared at Investor Day in March.
As we believe it remains a useful framework for discussing the drivers of our current performance.
I’ll provide more details on the specific drivers as we review our reported results but overall we believe we are doing the right things to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term.
Thinking ahead to Q4 we expect results to reflect some of the same headwinds as the current quarter including incremental spending on growth initiatives as well as the discreet impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S.
dollar.
I’d also remind you that in Q4 2014 we had a net benefit related to the sale of our investment in Concur.
Throughout this year we have said that our full year 2015 outlook was for EPS to be flat to modestly down versus the prior year.
To be more specific as we sit here today with one quarter left in the year we estimate that full year 2015 EPS will be between $5.20 and $5.35.
We believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and within our target range of 12% to 15% in 2017 remains appropriate.
As you recall our outlook for 2015 to 2017 does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Now to turn to a review of our financial results on Slide 3.
Billings were flat versus the prior year on a reported basis.
Adjusted for FX billings growth was 5% during Q3 reflecting slower volume growth across our U.S.
consumer and corporate portfolios.
I’ll provide more details on our build business performance shortly.
Reported revenues were down 1% but were up 3% after adjusting for FX.
This is slower than the adjusted Q2 revenue growth rate in part due to the modestly slower billings growth and the merchant rebate accrual benefit that impacted discount revenue last quarter.
Net income was down 14% year-over-year primarily reflecting an increase in spending on growth initiatives and the discreet impacts from changes to our co-brand relationships and the stronger U.S.
dollar.
We estimate that the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% during the quarter and that the negative impact from FX further reduced EPS by another approximately 4% to 5%.
Below the net income line we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and have repurchased 56 million shares over the past 12 months which has reduced our average share count by 5%.
As a result EPS was down 11% versus the prior year despite the 14% drop in net income and at $0.02 EPS impact related to our preferred dividend payment.
As we have said previously we expected our quarterly earnings performanace will be more uneven during this transitional period and certainly you saw that in our results this quarter.
Our focus continues to be on the earnings outlook for each year and the long term as opposed to the performance any given quarter.
Turning to our billings performance by region on slide four on an FX suggested basis billings growth was 5% during the quarter versus 6% in Q2 driven by a sequential decline in U.S.
volume growth.
I’ll provide more context on the U.S.
results in a few minutes so let me begin with a review of the international billings trends.
While we continue to face an evolving regulatory landscape going forward we have seen very solid performance trends across our international regions over the last several quarters.
JAPA remained our fastest growth region with volumes up 14% on an FX suggested basis.
The strong performance was again powered by Japan and China.
While performance in China remained robust year-over-year growth was lower than in Q2 which drove a deceleration in regional volume growth and also in the GNS segment as you will see on the next slide.
As a reminder while China does impact our billings growth rates it is a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within China today.
Moving to the EMEA region volume growth remained consistent at 9% on an FX suggested basis including double digit growth in the U.K.
The year-over-year decline in LACC volumes is being driven by Canada which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada.
This will continue to impact our volume growth until Q1 2016 although it will begin to lessen next quarter as Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014.
Outside of Canada LACC regional growth remains in the double digits including strong performance in Mexico and Argentina during Q3.
Overall international performance excluding Canada continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX suggested basis versus the prior year during Q3.
We are pleased with our progress outside the U.S.
which reflects strong performance in the consumer and network businesses where we have seen encouraging returns on our recent growth initiatives.
As our largest global issuer we constantly balance global strategies and local execution seeking to leverage our best practices capabilities and learnings in all the markets in which we compete.
Looking at the results by segment now on slide five we saw a slower growth in GCS or billings were up 1% on an FX suggested basis and in the USCS segment where volume growth slowed to 5% versus 6% last quarter.
As I mentioned in my initial comments billings growth particularly in the U.S.
continues to be impacted by a number of headwinds during 2015.
I’ll provide a bit of color on this.
On average we are seeing lower average transaction sizes in the U.S.
as opposed to card members using their American Express cards less frequently.
In total U.S.
transactions increased 7% versus the prior year with the average transaction size was down 3%.
We are clearly seeing this impact on gas spending where for the industry average gas prices are down 25% versus the prior year.
Lower average transaction sizes are also a driver within airline spending which constitutes 7% of our total volumes in the U.S.
and is down 3% year-over-year.
And this decrease is consistent with the recent trends in average ticket prices and revenue performance across the U.S.
airline industry.
The slower airline spend had a larger relative impact within GCS where airlines make up approximately 25% total spend.
Also in GCS we saw a slowdown in growth across middle market customers in the U.S.
Despite this near term performance we do see opportunities to accelerate growth in this segment as we continue to focus and leverage our efforts to bring together some of the unique products and services we can offer to middle market customers.
And last moving back to the USCS segment consistent with the prior quarter we saw volumes on the Costco co-brand product soften [ph].
Although the loan portfolio and Costco remained approximately 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of Q3.
More broadly on Costco we have not seen a significant earnings impact from Costco in the U.S.
as lower volume growth to date has been offset by reduced marketing expenses associated with the co-brand portfolio.
One other Costco point we do realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi.
Reality is this is a very complex transaction and I don’t think it would be appropriate to comment on the specifics during the discussions.
We will provide more detail on the outcome and its implications for our 2016 EPS outlook as soon as the discussions are complete.
Moving on now to loan growth on slide six you can see that worldwide loans increased by 4% versus last year.
In the U.S.
which constitutes the majority of our loans growth was steady at 7% during Q3 and continues to outpace the industry.
International loan balances remain down year-over-year due to FX and the end of our Costco relationship in Canada.
Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances however international loan growth improved to 9% during Q3.
So we are pleased with the underlying trends of loan growth.
We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing and new customers globally without significantly changing the overall list profile.
Now like other U.S.
companies with a significant global footprint our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates.
Over the past year the dollar has strengthened significantly year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S.
as you can see at the bottom slide seven.
The dollar’s strength will have an impact on our performance for the balance of the year and could impact 2016 as well.
Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX suggested revenue growth rates you can see the difference between our reported revenue growth and our FX suggested revenue growth remained relatively consistent as FX dragged our reported revenue growth by approximately 400 basis points in both Q2 and Q3.
When reached [ph] moved this dramatically there is also a bottom line impact.
And as I mentioned earlier we estimate that the strengthening of the dollar reduced our EPS by approximately 4% to 5% during the quarter.
Over the longer term we continue to believe that being a global company it generates revenue when a diverse set of markets around the world is strength of our business model.
So let's move now to our revenue performance on slide eight.
Where you see that our reported revenues were down 1% versus the prior year but increase 3% on an FX adjusted basis.
As I just discussed the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar had a significant impact on a number of revenue lines including discount revenue net card fees and other commissions which all increased year-over-year after adjusting for FX.
Other revenue also grew versus Q3 2014 after adjusting for FX and the gain from the sales of ICBC and Concur shares in the prior year.
FX adjusted revenue growth of 3% did slow sequentially versus the prior quarter this was in part due to the modest slowing and billed business growth that I discussed.
I'd also remind you that our second quarter results included a benefit in discount revenue related to certain merchant rebate accruals which resulted in a year-over-year increase at a discount rate during Q2.
The two basis points year-over-year decline in the discount rate this quarter was in part driving by the growth of the OptBlue program as well as the continued downward pressure that we traditionally have from changes in mix competition.
These impacts were partially offset by the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume where we're under much lower than average discount rate.
We continue to make steady progress with the OptBlue program.
With the recent edition of Chase Paymentech all of the top ten U.S.
merchant acquirers have now signed up to join the OptBlue program.
We are signing a significant number of new merchants to the program and are focused on driving greater awareness and card member spending at these new AmEx-accepting locations over time.
Continuing the merchant related items in the U.S.
it's now been approximately three months since the DoJ's remedy took effect.
While the remedy has not yet had an impact on our business it is still too early to tell what the longer term impact in the marketplace will be? Before moving on slide eight I would say we are pleased with the strong growth of 8% in net interest income driven by our continued progress and growing the loan portfolio and lower funding costs.
Turning to credit on slide nine we are pleased that our lending credit metrics remained at low levels with our write-off rate declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rates remaining flat.
Moving to slide 10 our credit performance during the quarter combined with higher loan balances to drive an 8% year-over-year increase in provision which included a $53 million reserve billed.
Our credit metrics have been steadily improving since the downturn.
They have generally stabilized at the current levels over the course of the past year.
Therefore reserve releases from improved credit performance are no longer offsetting the additional reserves needed to higher loan balances.
This performance is in line with our expectations that provision would increase year-over-year and in part reflect the steady growth we are seeing in the loan portfolio.
Going forward we do continue to anticipate that write-off rates will gradually increase from today's low levels in part due to the seasoning of our newer loan vintages.
This is consistent with our comments from investor day about expecting to see some steady upward tick write-off rates and the modest billed in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving to expense performance on slide 11 our total expenses increased by 3% during the current quarter performance deferred significantly across P&amp;L lines.
And all expenses benefited from the year-over-year change in FX rates.
On an FX adjusted basis total expenses increased by 7% during the quarter.
I'll walk you through the details of marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes.
Let me first touch on a few other items on this slide.
Reward expense increased 4% versus the prior year a bit above the growth proprietary billings which excludes GNS.
Performance this quarter includes the portion of discreet impact from renewed co-brand relationships.
Our renewed co-brand relationships continue to have a more significant impact on the cost [Indiscernible] is up 31% versus the prior year.
As I mentioned earlier we estimate that all of the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% this quarter.
This estimate includes the impact of our renewed co-brand relationships with Delta Starwood Cathay Pacific British Airways and Iberia as well as the net impact on our Canadian business from the end of our Costco relationship.
The co-brand impact is primarily concentrated in cost of card member services and reward expenses although there is an impact on revenue growth as well.
Let's now turn to the marketing and promotion slide 12.
Marketing and promotion expenses were $847 million in the quarter and were up significantly from Q2 due to the higher spending on growth initiatives we did this quarter.
On year-over-year basis marketing and promotion was 8% higher than the prior year it was up 14% after adjusting for FX.
The increase in M&amp;P this quarter is consistent with our expectations as we have been clear since the Costco decision earlier this year that we intent for the spending on growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be at or slightly higher than the elevated levels of full year 2014.
We have also highlighted that the increase will be more concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
To provide some additional perspective about our growth initiative spending we included the breakdown on slide 13 that we have previous shared in mid September.
We continue to feel that this slide is helpful way to think about what we broadly consider to be our spending on growth initiatives within the company.
As you can see while a large portion of this spending occurs within marketing and promotion.
A significant amount also occurs within operating expenses.
Some of the impact also shows up as contra revenue.
I can make a few comments related specifically to the spending during the third quarter.
A large portion of the increase in marketing and promotion during Q3 was focused on our efforts to attract new card members across our consumer small business corporate franchises around the globe.
For example in our U.S.
consumer business we ramped up acquisition efforts our cash rebate products as well as our gold charge card Starwood preferred guest credit card both of which were recently refresh with several new card member benefits.
We also increased our spending on longer term technology initiatives including efforts to enhance the digital capabilities that we provide to middle market corporations and small businesses.
A higher spending during Q3 also help drive progress across the number of business initiatives including adding Sam's to our merchant-acceptance network rolling out Apple Pay to our corporate card and U.K.
card members as well as the continued expansion of the Plenti loyalty coalition program.
So as I just mentioned the efforts to attract new card members are one of the key focus areas for our incremental growth initiative spending.
In this context we are pleased to see that these efforts drove a significant increase in new card acquired across our U.S.
consumer small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter as you can see on slide 14.
Now obviously it will take time from the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our results which is why our focus has consistently been on our performance over the multiyear outlook period.
Moving to operating expenses on slide 15 operating expenses were down 1% year-over-year and increase 3% on an FX adjusted basis.
As I mentioned operating expense performance this quarter reflected an increase level of spending on growth initiatives including a number of technology initiatives.
As a portion of the spending on these technology initiative hits the professional services and occupancy and equipment line we'll provide a bit more detail on just what is including [Indiscernible].
Starting with professional services I would point out that the majority of expenses in this line are related to the technology cost that we pay third parties.
This P&amp;L line also includes the fees we pay third parties for credit and collection activities as well as some of the incentives we pay merchant acquirers.
Similarly moving to occupancy and equipment over 75% of the cost in this line on a year to-date basis are related to data processing including the license fees we pay technology providers and depreciation costs associated with our technology hardware and software.
The remainder consist primarily depreciation expense on office equipment and buildings and the rents we pay for office space around the world.
Similar to our performance across other operating expense lines we have gained efficiency in our professional services and occupancy and equipment expenses over time.
As we have rationalized our technology infrastructure and location footprint around the world we believe there is a sustained opportunity to deliver operating leverage going forward as technology continues to become cheaper and more powerfully each year and our customers and merchants increasingly demonstrate a preference to engage with us through more digital channels.
Moving on let me touch specifically 21% increase in occupancy and equipment expense this quarter.
The increase was driven by a $91 million impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development cost primarily within enterprise curve including the decision not to continue with certain investments within the group.
We continuously evaluate our investments across the company to ensure that we are deploying the right level of resources against our most attractive opportunities.
In this context we decided to pull back on certain initiatives in enterprise globe during the current quarter including the decision to not proceed with the launch of served product Mexico.
These decisions are aligned with some recent organizational changes with enterprise growth including consolidating the server platform and related capabilities under Steve Squeri.
More broadly we continually look at ways to make our overall organization more effective streamlining the processes that cut across multiple parts of the company and focusing the organization on a most attractive growth opportunities in both the consumer and business to business space.
As we set priorities for 2016 and beyond we will focus on those opportunities that can produce the best returns.
And we will be ensuring that we have the proper operating structure to deliver results in the most efficient and effective way.
To conclude now on operating expenses and moving to slide 16 despite the greater spending on technology initiatives in the quarter adjusted operating expenses are down 3% on a year to-date basis and up 1% on an FX adjusted basis both well below our 3% target for 2015.
Now shifting to our capital performance on slide 17 during the quarter we've return well over 100% of the capital generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
Our Q3 performance again demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength and also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now conclude by stepping away some of the complex that I just took it through and going back the key themes is in our results.
Overall our Q3 performance reflected the headwinds and challenges that we have been managing throughout 2015.
As expected or into a down year-over-year due to the ramp up and spending on growth initiatives and the discreet impacts some changes in our co-brand relationships and the stronger U.S.
dollar.
In addition billings and revenue growth continue to be impacted by the challenging economic competitive in regulatory environment.
Against this backdrop we continue to move ahead with initiatives to build our business the years ahead.
We're investing substantially more at marketing incentives and technology to attract new card members and additional spending to our network.
We're expanding card acceptance at an accelerated pace amongst merchants and added Sam's Club the eighth largest retailer in the U.S.
throughout network earlier this month.
We're broadening our relationship with card members to accommodate more of their borrowing needs and our loan portfolio continues steady growth this quarter.
The flexibility to investment in these another growth initiative comes in part of our ongoing progress in containing operating expenses throughout the company.
We also continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet that allow us to return a substantially portion of our earnings to shareholders to share repurchases dividends.
We remained committed to these actions and believe that these are the right things to do to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term.
With that I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&amp;A session.
Thanks Jeff.
As a reminder our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the session therefore before we open up the lines for Q&amp;A I’ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question.
Thank you for your cooperation in this process.
With that the operator will now open up the lines for questions.
Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of Autonomous.
Please go ahead.
Yes.
Hi thanks.
Two questions first could talk about the magnitude to which cash back rewards acting as a country revenue items are impacting the merchant discount rate.
And secondly you're calling out loyalty partner in your press release as adding to revenue growth in a meaningful way.
Can you contrast that to Plenti and how we should think growth in Plenti long term? Thanks.
Let me start Craig with the cash back question certainly in the U.S.
consumer business in particular we have been seeing very nice growth in our cash back products and as you know the accounting for our cash back products does push – does make the cash back a contra revenue.
So when you look at the discount rate that we report what we try to do is reflect the actual economics that we're getting at the point of sell with the merchants and so we try to – we take that out of that calculation.
What you do the straight calculation of the income statement of discount revenue over your business; you are capturing the higher growth rates of the cash back products.
All that said I would say that in the grant scheme of the company overall the cash back product still relatively modest part of the overall portfolio which is why we don't specifically call out the impact it has on [Indiscernible].
In terms of royalty partner what I would say is to remind everyone we have a business that is more mature in a variety of other countries around the globe like Germany Poland India it’s a little bit newer in Mexico and in Italy and we're really pleased with the way the business is developed in all of those countries as it has gotten to profitability.
When you go to the U.S.
we were really pleased and excited about the launch of Plenti earlier this year.
It’s very very early days in the U.S.
and so we're very encouraged by the growth that we've seen and the number of members that Plenti has been able to attract that you head several of the other partners in Plenti talk about their view of the progress and it’s all very positive.
What I would say on the U.S is it’s still early days and we will need to see how it progresses over the next year or two before begins to have a more material impact on the company's financial results.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
And the next question comes from the line of Don Vendetti of Citigroup.
Please go ahead.
Hi Jeff.
Just wanted to ask on your GNS business and I guess also on U.S.
in general.
Do you think you're holding your market share in GNS you clearly laid out some issues around the pressure from airline pricing and maybe China was off a little bit? But if you strip that out that's always been kind of like a very strong area for you can you talk a little bit about that.
And then on the U.S.
side I should say more on the corporate side do you think you have a structural issue there or you just kind of weak because of general economics and some of the issues you highlight last quarter around airlines? So couple of the questions there Don I maybe parse it into pieces talking a little bit about GNS little bit about the U.S on share and then maybe little bit about corporate solely each of those.
If you look GNS just to remind everyone our GNS business generate some about 85% or so of its billings outside the U.S and then about 15% comp in the U.S.
so you really have a broad range of market conditions.
You have markets like the U.S.
Australia U.K.
where we run a network business side by side with our proprietary business.
And then you have a lot of markets around the globe China being a good example where through our partner and in fact the GNS business that's how we operator American Express through a franchise model.
So across that many different markets I think it’s a little challenging to generalize by share but I would make the general points that we're really pleased with the growth rate we're seeing in GNS everywhere in the world.
And share is something that we probably think about differentially in each market depending on whether it’s a pure GNS market or a combined proprietary and GNS market.
But I would say we feel very good about our share trends on a combined basis outside the U.S.
and when you take out the one challenge we have in Canada I think we – when you look at our overall international growth rates we'll match up very well in most few quarters with the broader sense.
And turning to the U.S.
you talked about U.S share we probably have loss a little bit of share to U.S.
in recent quarters but I'll make a broader point that over the last five years of actual gain quite a bit of share in the U.S and we think about our prospects over the longer term.
We also are focused at the end of the day on our share industry profits and industry revenues.
We actually think we've done pretty well including in recent quarters on that front.
We're very thoughtful about what opportunities are going to produce the best return to our shareholders and sometime that does not always leave you to the same answer as what might produce largest billings share.
Go to last part of your question go to corporate in particular in the U.S.
as I said in my remarks the slowdown in airlines spend and all the airlines see what is remarkable when you look both the large profits you are also generating right now even the drop in fuel prices but also the pretty tough revenue environment therein with industry revenues and industry unit revenues and the U.S.
down.
That just reflected in our numbers where we don't think we're losing it share.
When we look at numbers of transactions but the average transaction size is just trending right along with the airline.
Industry spends that does particularly impact our corporate business since airlines were about 25% of that business.
And we have seen a little bit of slowdown in the middle market part of our corporate business.
As I mentioned in my remarks but I would tell you over the medium to long term we continue to see this area of the middle market section of business and the U.S.
is a real growth opportunity for us that's why we made some of the organizational changes we made earlier this year putting together our corporate card business and our open franchise under the leadership of Steve Squeri because that's why I talked a little bit about some of the technology initiatives.
Spending we are doing to strengthen and refine some of our products targeted at that segment.
So we haven't lost any of our enthusiasm for growth opportunities in that segment in the medium to long term if you have seen a number of factors that slowed us down this quarter.
Thank you.
Okay thank you.
And next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
You added lot of new cards this quarter substantial increase more than what we expected now.
What is the cost regarding those cards does cost per account gone up and if not why not accelerate marketing obviously that would be the best way to grow through the Costco in 2017 is to continue to add substantial number of account so maybe just talk about the quality of the accounts the cost per account and whether or not the amount of cards we saw this quarter is sustainable? Thank you.
Good question Bob.
We feel really good and really pleased to see the growth in new accounts.
What I would point out is we see growth opportunities across lots of the pieces of our portfolio and the reason you've heard us talk about since earlier this year staying at an elevated level growth oriented spending in 2015 is because we wanted to do exactly what you just suggested which is as we think about the termination of the Costco U.S.
contracts sometime in 2016 we think we have a lot of growth opportunities.
We think in a significant fixed cost business it makes a lot of sense to sees as many of the growth opportunities as we tend now to position ourselves for that Costco change in 2016.
When you think about what we're requiring we feel really good about the average quality of the accounts we're acquiring.
And in terms of cost of acquiring those accounts and we look at historical trends we also feel really good that we are spending more absolute dollars that's with the elevated level of growth spending is all about and its being reflected in a much higher level of new account cards acquired in the average cost is pretty similar to what we've historically experience.
So I suppose the other part of your question why don't you do even more? Well we're always balancing our financial material and marketing resources and trying to make trade-offs that we think are optimal for our shareholders.
So we are – we believe we're going as aggressively as we can and should be given the range of opportunities.
And I would just say we're encouraged by the progress we saw this last quarter.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
And next question from the line of Bill Carache of Nomura.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Hi Jeff.
Hi Bill.
I wanted to ask a question I've gotten from several investors who are wondering whether the quarter's results suggest that you guys are facing a little bit more pressure than you expected earlier in the year.
I know you said that the results were in line with your expectations.
But I think the reason people are asking is because the 2015 target EPS growth range of 520 to 535 that you provided implies in the area of I think like 3.5 to kind of 6.5 negative 6.5% growth and I think people are viewing that as worse than the flat to slightly negative growth range that you've given previously and so I was hoping that maybe you could speak to that? Well it’s good question Bill.
I think as we look at 2015 on the earnings side the reality is it will come in very much in the range that we originally envisioned.
If you go back to February when we first provided an outlook and I suppose it goes little bit to how you want to define modestly down.
The reason we gave a range if you go back to the beginning of 2015 is we wanted to make sure in the current environment we're giving ourselves the flexibility to do the right things for the company for the long-term.
If you think about the question that Bob just asked we are pleased by what we saw in the outcome or some of the fruits of the higher levels of spending we did in Q3 and that does suggest to us that we should continue to pursue many of those growth opportunities and stay at a pretty elevated level of spending to do it and that does drive us probably more towards the modestly down part of our original guidance than the flat part of our guidance.
I do want to downplay the fact that as you've seen in the last couple of years it’s also a tough economic environment.
If you go back to January and February as we were putting our plans in place and you look at all the economic forecasts and we just raise our own plans on the consensus economic forecast we don't try to say we could forecast better than anybody else.
The actual have all come in below what the consensus was earlier this year and we are used to that part of the flexibility in our business model as we've got a lot leverage to pull to make sure we can react to that.
But that has been a challenging thing for us.
Gas prices staying down it’s been challenging.
Foreign exchange getting a little worse.
When we first provided an outlook for 2015 the US dollar on a weighted average basis versus the range of currencies that matter to us was probably down around 10%.
It’s gone down close to another 10% since then.
So all those things are factors but we're trying to focus on our the core underlying things that will really determine the run rate of the company as we get past a range of the challenges facing us in the near term here and we feel pretty good about those trends.
I appreciate that.
Thank you for taking my question Jeff.
Okay thank you.
And the next question from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
Maybe to follow-up on that last question.
I guess then as we look forward and you guys talk about returning to growth how do you define returning to growth and what gives you the confidence that you can achieve this and I guess how does the Costco portfolio sale affect I know you cannot really speak to Costco's portfolio sale.
But how does that sale factor into the return to growth? And just one final one how much of the run rate of cost savings from the workforce reduction is actually in this year's number? Thank you.
Finishing right note Sanjay that’s a lot of questions.
I want to make sure I get them… Sorry.
No all really good questions.
So how do we define growth? I guess what I will tell you is that our view of sort of absolute levels of what we believe we can achieve in 2016 has not changed at all since February.
So nothing that we have seen that I just talked about in response to bills question are things that we don't think are manageable within all of the leverage we have to pull thinking about 2016.
Second when you think about Costco I'll remind you that when we first back on February 12 provided our two year financial outlook we said we're confident that we can achieve the 2016 outlook we've then provided which was a return to positive growth sort of regardless of what happened with Costco portfolio.
So we still don't know what the outcome is going to be around the portfolio.
When we do we will talk about it publicly quickly.
And when we do that will allow us Sanjay to be more precise because there's a lot of – there is quite a range of outcomes around the portfolio and until we know those it’s tough to give you a number.
But what I want to come back to is the point I'm trying to make is that the underlying performance - to a positive earnings performance in 2015 so we lost are lights here in.
If you think about what the drivers our next year well just think about our financial framework so the co-brand headwinds that we've had all of 2015 5% was the headwind this quarter drop away as you get into 2016.
FX for particularly this quarter is a big headwind.
Now I suppose the dollar could move another 10% or 20% over the course of the next four quarters and if it does that will be headwind for us.
But if it doesn’t you should have an easier compare next year from an FX perspective.
You brought up costs you are correct that in fact when you look at some of the actions that are behind the restructuring charge we took at the end of 2014 many of those savings won't really get to full year run rate until you get to 2016.
I'd also remind you that we said all along that we will be mindful as we think about volume trends and Costco going away about what further steps we can take to make other improvements in our cost structure.
So all of those things Sanjay to conclude combined to say my view of what this company can generate in 2016 is really the same today as it was in February when we first provided the guidance In my view of 2015 is we really have come in within the envelope that we set for ourselves leaving ourselves enough flexibility to make the right decisions to run the company for the long-term.
Thank you.
Okay thank you.
Next question is from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan.
Please go ahead.
Guys thanks for taking my question.
Just a quick clarification.
It looks like you restated book value historically can you just tell us happen there? Restated.
You might need to help me out Rich.
I am not sure… When we look back the book value didn’t tie out to what we had previously and when we went back and looked at the old numbers there was a difference is there anything there or are we just screwing something up? This maybe one we need to take off-line.
I'm looking around at my colleagues here and we're not quite sure but let's get to the… Okay.
I'll hope with you off-line.
Thank you Jeff.
All right.
Thanks Rick.
Okay thank you.
And next question from the line of David Hochstim of Buckingham Research.
Please go ahead.
Thanks.
Hi Jeff.
I'm wondering could you expand on your comments about enterprise growth and the changes you made.
And I guess I really want to understand also with the $91 million impairment charge is sort of a one-time item or is that kind of recurring because it’s really equal to the FX headwind and the co-brand headwind if it’s not recurring? Well so a couple of comments.
We are continually looking at all of the choices we have about where we invest our management and financial resources in order to produce the best outcome for our shareholders.
And we continually learn from things we try we continually need to react to the evolving competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate.
And so one of the things that we've done over the last quarter is made some different decisions about product strategies and resource allocation around a number of the businesses [Indiscernible] As you do that's from a pure accounting perspective the reality in a company like ours where you are developing a lot of software and where you capitalize a fair amount of the software as you sometimes end up with things on the balance sheet that relate to products that you are deemphasizing or not going to continue with.
One of the examples I did callout in my remarks is we had planned to launch the Siro [ph] product in Mexico.
That may still be a good idea at some point but we decided looking around at all of our other opportunities that’s not something we want to further invest in right now and that does drive pulling some assets off the balance sheet.
So all of that lead you to this is certainly not a recurring event; this is a one-time sort of charge that is reflective of decisions that were made this quarter.
I would just make the observation that I tried to be pretty clear in my remarks that in the current challenging competitive regulatory and economic environment you will see us continually making changes to the organization.
And to where we choose to put resources and that may from time-to-time drive other kinds of one-time charges or contingencies that won't stop us from doing things we think are the best interest of long-term value creation for shareholders.
Okay.
But I mean wouldn’t you've been consider this a kind of one time item like FX this quarter? I suppose it depends David on exactly how you want to define one-time item.
I'm just trying to be clear on what the $91 million was.
All right.
Okay.
Sorry and I know only one question like everybody else.
The Costco being is that included in your 2016 guidance? No I think we've always said going back to when we first provided the outlook on February 12 that our comment that we will return to positive EPS growth in 2016 was really agnostic on the question of what happens with Costco and did not include any particular net gain on the Costco sale.
Thanks a lot.
Okay.
Thank you.
And the next question from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel.
Please go ahead.
Chris Brendler your line is open.
Sorry I was on mute can you hear me now? Yes.
Now it’s clear.
Hi actually my question.
Good afternoon.
So I wanted to ask a follow up question on the U.S.
business.
You’ve heard some of your competitors complaining about the competitive environment in the U.S.
and just how aggressive the rewards competition has become.
And I really haven’t heard American Express address that as an issue that’s weighting on growth.
So maybe if you could just help me think about what’s happening in the U.S.
business has it decelerated but these are mostly just a co-brand that you’ve potentially lost or is there also increased competition there? Well Chris I try never to complain.
I try to focus on what we can do better and there’s always plenty of things we can do better on.
Look it’s a challenging competitive environment.
And we would not dispute that in anyway and I think I started my earlier comments by saying it’s a pretty challenging environment.
All that said our goal at American Express is to take the many fairly unique strengths that we have and find ways to create great offerings for our card members and our merchants in ways that are not necessarily easily replicable.
The strength of our brand is something I think nobody else can really match.
The breadth of our product line which allows us to offer very targeted value propositions because everybody who is listening to this call will have a different range of things that they value most and we think the breadth of our product line merely allows us to hone in on the many different demographic groups targets that we have who we think we can provide value for.
Our reputation for service our global reach the size and scale of our proprietary rewards program membership rewards.
Some of the data and analytics we get from the close loop and the way that allows us to be very targeted in our marketing and they are already targeted and how we work with our merchants and how we put together offers.
Those are all the kinds of things that we try very hard to leverage so that as we think about what is undoubtedly a very competitive environment.
We’re not just out there saying boy can we offer 10 basis points more on a cash net card then everybody else cause that’s going to be the whole determinant.
You’ve heard me say on these calls before there will always be some portion card members who actually do want to go to website pop the map and say what card is going to produce the best math for me.
And we are going to have a tougher time using our -- some of our differentiated strengths for that segment.
And our experience that is still on minority customers.
And we think the breadth of our product line and many strengths we have allow us to compete in ways that produce better outcomes for our shareholders.
Okay thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Next question from the line of David Ho of Deutsche Bank Hi good evening.
I just want to circle back on the Costco medication obviously it’s kind of a broad based approach we are taking but we are seeing evidence that you know that you are targeting Costco customers and trying to maybe transition some of the value onto your existing ongoing cards like the Blue crash [ph] everyday.
Is that something that makes sense in terms of transitioning from the value onto your core products or some of your more attractive Costco customers ahead of the sale? Well David I’ll make a few points.
We are seeing many opportunities to grow our business and to grow our card member base across all of our consumer business portfolios around the globe.
One of the reasons we concluded earlier this year that in the long run we had better opportunities than going forward with what we think it would have taken to maintain our relationship with Costco.
We based it on the view that we have many growth opportunities and that’s what we are pursuing.
And we’ll be pleased that if you just look at the new cards acquired numbers this quarter comes from every part of our company.
Now certainly one of the avenues for growth is there is some portion of Costco card members who have strong ties through American Express and we’d love to work with capturing the spend and lend of those people subject to as I’ve also said many times the normal provisions you would expect in most of these kinds of contracts that put a lot of limitations around how you specifically market to the Costco card members.
So we are very diligent about making sure we adhere to the spirit and letter of that contract.
So our marketing efforts are really about how do we just in general market to all the many routes across the U.S.
and across the globe that we think are attractive candidates to be card members of American Express and certainly as we do that some portion of the Costco card members are liable to see those efforts and likely to be interested in pursuing a relationship with American Express in another way.
Okay.
Thanks and on a related note can you please remind us how quickly when you find out the new card customer it really depends on the mix but how quickly you typically see a tick up in revolving activity after some of these new card acquisitions is it you know a few quarters is it one year out and how you think about that? Yes I want to be a little careful about being specific because when you have the breadth of products we do from consumer to business to corporations to lend products to charge card products the answer is a little different for every one of those types of products as a really general matter to look.
As I said in my remarks while we are really pleased that we acquired 2.3 million new card members this quarter there is a process of getting them to understand the product.
They are beginning to build spend beginning to build a little bit of royalty to American Express.
For those who are going to engage in lend or borrowing behavior that balance that has to build.
As a general matter we think of getting to the point where you are having meaningful bottom line contribution from new card that requires being something that happens in the second and third year.
You’ll see other metrics show up much more quickly but at the end of the day we are very focused on what it takes to get people to profitability.
Great.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from the line of Cheryl Pate of Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
Hi good afternoon.
I just want to touch back on the comments earlier about the average transaction size coming down a little bit and appreciate the color around gas and airlines.
I was just wondering if there is anything else we should be thinking about there as well.
For example in some of the new card acquisitions is that meaningfully different customer than your current average customer or does something like OptBlue where we are adding a lot of small merchants does that factor in as well? Those are all actually really good questions Cheryl would probably answer [Indiscernible] as precise as any of us would like.
Now I’d make a couple of points.
The -- our transaction growth has been to make a general statement -- that really consistent over the last couple of years in around that 7% level.
What is quite striking in recent quarters is the way the average transaction size is really the trend lines has really changed.
Certainly some of the things we do about our steady efforts to drive more everyday spend you would expect over a long period of time and a gradual rate have an impact here.
But what you really see is quite different.
And as a little bit more tied in timing to cash prices going down to some of the challenges the airlines have had on the revenue side.
And in fact we see the average transaction size coming down across other categories like retail as well.
So I have to tell you at this point we’re still spending a lot of time thinking ourselves about just what it all means.
I think there is probably a little bit of influence from some of the things we are doing internally but I think there is a lot of influence from a variety of external factors in just what’s going on in the overall very low inflation to so many categories frankly maybe there is inflation and economy that we are now doing business in.
Great.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
Thank you.
The next question from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.
Please go ahead.
Yes hi I have --an actually related question that if we look back over the past three quarters U.S.
card member loan growth has actually outpaced U.S.
card service build business growth by 1% to 2%.
Historically we’ve seen kind of the [Indiscernible] build business growth really kind of wed your loan growth going forward.
Is that a sign Jeff that you are kind of shifting on incremental growth towards more of a -- kind of a lend centric customer base than a spend centric and if so kind of what are the implications for the migration of returns? That’s a good question Mark.
I think you have to keep this in perspective.
So if you look overall at American Express net interest income is -- and how you want to measure it 15% to 20% of our P&amp;L that unlike any of our competitors where the numbers are 50% to 90%.
We have a very spend centric collection of businesses.
When the Costco loan portfolio goes away in 2016 that’s 20% of the loan portfolio that drives that net interest income.
So we have in our view a long lease to go over the next few years just to stay in place in terms of the current contribution that lend makes to the overall economics of the company.
And that’s why we do in the U.S.
consumer business let’s call it some of our other businesses see a little bit of opportunity to continue on the path we’ve been on for a few years which is when you look at our own customers we under index on our share getting our share of their borrowing behavior versus the share of their spend behavior that to us is just an opportunity to obvious for us not to continually work at it.
And that’s really what has allowed us for many quarters now to steadily grow our loan balances above where the industry was going then in the U.S.
or you’ll hear us over and over again say but we’re comfortable that we are doing that without materially changing the risk profile of the company.
So that’s really all you see going on here and as I said I think we will be quite some time once the Costco loan portfolio goes away before we even back to where we are today.
But the exciting thing to us we see a long ramp that should allow us to continue to grow loans in the U.S.
a little bit faster than the industry while I’m changing the risk profile of the company.
Thank you.
Rochelle we have time for one more question.
Okay thank you.
And then the final question then comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI.
Please go ahead.
Thank you.
With interchange caps going into effect this December in Europe what actions will American Express take to sustain your growth even though your proprietary business will not be regulated.
Your merchant discount rate to be twice as high as MasterCards which potentially could negatively pressure merchant acceptance? Good question David.
We said for a while that when you look at the EU regulation which to remind everyone is that it targeted the semester card and will cap interchange rates.
That will put some downward pressure on our discount rates.
And frankly you see that downward pressure even this year.
Despite that I’ll be pretty pleased with our performance in Europe this year and I would point out to you that we have long had in Europe in most countries varies by country but in most country very significant premium to MasterCard and Visa.
So that’s not a new phenomenon.
What the Interchange regulation will do is put downward pressure on us not to go to the points where the Interchange is capped but put pressure on us to move it down probably to keep the differential more similar.
So I think we’ll have to see how this goes.
I would tell you that sitting here today we are pretty pleased by this year’s result and you already see changes in the competitive environment as the number of issuers have announced pullbacks on the products or rewards they are able to offer.
And like all of these things our challenge and opportunity is to try to find ways to mitigate the obvious downside which will put some downward pressure on our discoveries in Europe but trying to offset that with saying the word opportunities because they create to perhaps do somethings that other can’t and at the end of the day I think what the European regulations are really seeking is a competitive and more competitive European environment.
Our market shares in most of those countries are quite small so we loved being more competitive to find ways to grow overtime but both we’ll have to see.
Thank you.
So let me thank you all for joining tonight’s call and Toby do you want to make a few last comments? Sure thanks Jeff.
As part of our commitment to provide investors with the exposure of company leadership our executives plan to speak at several events in the fourth quarter.

Additionally Jeff Campbell plans to participate in the JPMorgan Financial Technologies and Specialty finance forum in New York on December 2nd.
And finally our Chief Executive Officer Ken Chenault plans to participate in the Goldman Sachs U.S.
financial services conference in New York on December 9th.
Live audio webcast of each of these events will be made available to the general public through the American Express investor relations website at ir.americanexpress.com.
Thank you again for joining tonight’s call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express.
Rochelle I’ll turn it back over to you.
Okay.
Thank you.
And that concludes your conference for today.
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference service.
You may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing-by and welcome to the American Express Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time all participants are in listen-only mode.
Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.
[Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder today's teleconference is being recorded.
At this time I will turn the conference over to your host Ted of Investor Relations Mr.
Toby Willard please go ahead sir.
Thanks so much.
Welcome.
We appreciate all of you joining us for today’s call.
The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company’s future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today’s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company’s other reports already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2015 earnings release earnings supplement and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our Web site at ir.americanexpress.com.
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.
Today’s discussion will begin with Ken Chenault Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and will be joined by Jeff Campbell Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Once they complete their remarks we will move to a Q&amp;A session.
With that let me turn the discussion over to Ken.
Thanks Toby and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon.
We have a lot to cover with you today including a review of our fourth quarter and update on the Costco portfolio sale and our outlook for 2016 and 2017.
I'm joining the call today as I thought it was important to share my thoughts on the financial outlook and the evolving operating environment.
Before Jeff begins let me acknowledge that the performance we're discussing today is not what we or you are accustomed to say from American Express and that we are taking significant actions to change the trajectory of our business going forward.
During our remarks we'll address three main questions.
Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? Why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long-term? So with that let me turn it over to Jeff.
Well.
Thanks and good afternoon everyone.
To answer the question Ken just posed I'm going to start by explaining our 2015 results.
How they've impacted our view of the future and how they reflect the actions we are taking.
I'll also acknowledge upfront that across all the periods we're discussing there are a large number of items adding complexity to our results.
We've provided some normalizations to help you better understand the underlying performance trends.
I'll start on Page 2.
Our fourth quarter and full year performance reflected the strength and the headwinds that we've been managing throughout 2015 versus the prior year on a reported basis the billings were up 2% for both the quarter and the prior year.
Adjusted for FX billings growth was 5% during Q4 which was consistent with the prior quarter and slightly below the full year growth rate as billings did decelerate modestly during the second half of the year.
During the quarter revenues were down 8% year-over-year and were impacted by the stronger U.S.
dollar and the gain from the sale of our investment in Concur during the prior year.
Excluding FX and the Concur gain adjusted revenue growth was relatively consistent sequentially at 4% during the quarter.
This was also in line with our adjusted full year performance of 4%.
Earnings per share are $0.89 in the quarter and $5.05 for the year and included a charge in our Enterprise Growth business which was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology together with some restructuring charges.
Excluding this charge adjusted EPS would have been $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.38 for the full year down 3% from last year’s EPS of $5.56 which did include a net gain of about $0.10 on the global business travel and Concur transactions.
This performance is slightly above the high-end of the earnings range we provided on the Q3 earnings call with the favorability primarily driven by our continued focus on operating expenses.
In terms of key drivers for the year our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth strong card acquisitions excellent credit performance disciplined operating expense controls and the benefits of our strong capital position.
In particular the accelerated new card acquisitions loan growth and expense control all stemmed from actions we took in late-2014 and throughout 2015 as it became clear that the environment was evolving and all these actions should further help us 2016 and beyond.
But these positives were challenged by several factors.
First the cumulative impact from the early renewals of our co-brand relationships with Delta Starwood British Airways Cathay Pacific and Iberia along with the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada reduced EPS in the quarter and the year by approximately 5%.
So we are done lapping these changes as we enter 2016.
Second the U.S.
dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed reducing EPS by another approximately 3% to 4% for both the quarter and the year.
At current rates the dollar will now represent a headwind for us as we enter 2016.
Third our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year remaining at the elevated levels we were at in 2014 further pressured our earnings in 2015 and we now intend to stay at these levels throughout 2016 before returning to lower levels in 2017.
And last the economic regulatory and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year progressed.
The combination of these factors resulted in our billings and revenue growth rates being fairly steady throughout the year whereas we had expected to see a sequential strengthening.
Despite these challenges we leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and again returned over $5 billion of capital through buybacks and dividends during 2015 which reduced our average share count by 5%.
These results also brought our reported return on equity for the period ending December 31st to 24% excluding the enterprise growth charge our adjusted ROE was 26% to slightly above our target and illustrates the continued strength of our business operations.
Let’s now go through the components of results beginning with Billed business performance by region and segment which is on Slides 3 and 4.
Billed business growth was 5% on an FX adjusted basis during the fourth quarter consistent with Q3 and below the full year number of 6%.
Overall our billings growth rate decelerated modestly during 2015 while we had anticipated a sequential strengthening.
Although this is disappointing we did see positive momentum in certain segments.
International performance excluding Canada continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q4.
I’d note that Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014 in advance of the termination of our relationship with them as of the end of 2014.
Therefore the drag on our ICS growth rate from Canada was smaller this quarter and we will fully lap this impact during the first quarter of 2016.
GNS remained our fastest growing segment with volumes increasing 14% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis powered by continued strong performance in China Korea and Japan.
In the USCS segment billings growth remained consistent sequentially 5% despite further softening in billings on the Costco co-brand product where volumes this quarter dropped more significantly versus the prior year.
I’d also note that lower gas prices continue to be a drag on USCS growth as average prices were down 24% versus the prior year.
GCS billed business growth continued to slow and volumes were flat versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis during the fourth quarter.
Performance continues to be impacted by lower airline volumes in a generally cautious corporate spending environment.
Looking forward into 2016 we expect to see a modest uptick in billings growth rates beginning in the first quarter as we lap some of the headwinds we faced in early 2015 and as our initiatives to drive growth have more impact.
Obviously our billings growth rates during the second half of the year will be impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in the U.S.
around mid-year.
Turning to loan performance on Slide 5 loans were down 17% on a reported basis but this is entirely related to the reclassification of a portion of our loans to held-for-sale effective December 1st.
We now expect the sale of JetBlue loan portfolio to occur during Q1 and I'll provide more details on the status of our Costco portfolio sale discussions later in my remarks.
Excluding the held-for-sale portfolios from the prior year worldwide loans were up 7% and U.S.
loans were up 10% versus the prior year.
Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances international loan growth also remained strong at 10% during Q4.
So we are pleased with the underlying trends in loan growth and that our increased investments and efforts to grow loans since earlier 2015 are already having an impact.
Looking forward we expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment and continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the Company.
I'll also remind you that net interest income this quarter made up only 18% of our total revenues.
Even if we continue to grow our loan portfolio at the higher rate you have seen our overall business model will remain very spend focused given the expected reduction in loans associated with the co-brand relationships which are ending this year.
Moving to our revenue performance on Slide 6 reported revenues were down for the full year and quarter driven by the prior year Concur gain and changes in FX.
Excluding these items adjusted revenue growth was 4% during the quarter which was consistent with our full year performance.
Looking at our major revenue drivers discount revenue was down 1% during the quarter which was relatively consistent with our full year performance.
During the quarter our discount rate declined by 2 basis points versus the prior year driven impart by the continued roll out of OptBlue.
Going forward we anticipate that our discount rate will decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of OptBlue a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures.
Moving to our other primary revenue driver growth in net interest income remained strong at 9% it’s modestly higher than our full year performance.
Performance continues to be driven by strong loan growth.
Stepping back while revenue growth did not accelerate sequentially as we anticipated through the year we were still able to consistently generate adjusted revenue growth of 4% even in a challenging environment.
Going forward subject to FX and economic trends we believe that our efforts are focused in the right areas to drive acceleration in our revenue growth rate.
Turning to credit performance on Slide 7 our provision was down 2% versus the prior year as lending write-off rates remained at lower levels.
Our write-off rates remained the lowest among large peer issues.
I'd note that the reclassification of a portion of our loans this quarter to held-for-sale had a small impact on provision but did not significantly change our performance trends or reported credit metrics.
Going forward the continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provision as we expected since we first provided our multiyear outlook last year.
We also expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members.
That said we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic performance.
Moving to expense performance on Slide 8 total expenses were up 1% in the quarter and down 1% for the year but were influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year.
Overall we continue to be very disciplined about controlling expenses but recognize that we will need to be even more aggressive going forward as evidenced by the $1 billion target to reduce our overall cost base announced in today's press release.
Looking at the quarter's results marketing and promotion expenses ramped up to $892 million which was similar to the prior year as we also had an elevated level of spending during Q4 '14 due to the Concur gain.
As we discussed another one of the key areas of focus for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving new card acquisitions.
In this context we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S.
consumer small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter which remained well above the average level of card acquisitions in prior periods.
Now obviously this is a very early cycle for our investors and it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our performance.
Turning to rewards expenses were down 5% in the current quarter driven by $109 million impact in the prior year related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta.
Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a significant impact on the cost of card member services which was up approximately 20% versus the prior year during both Q4 and the full year.
We will have lapped this as we head into 2016.
One last item I’d highlight is the tax rate which was 38.2% in the quarter and significantly above the full year rate due to the enterprise growth charge majority of which was not tax deductible.
Looking forward into 2016 excluding the impact of discrete items we believe that our underlying tax rate will be closer to the 34% to 35% range if it's trending to prior to this quarter.
While there were a number of items that impacted year-over-year growth in operating expenses adjusted operating expenses were down 2% for the full year and were up 2% after adjusting for FX.
Both of these results are below our 3% operating expense target and impart reflect actions we took at the end of 2014 and throughout 2015 as we observed that the environment was evolving.
We have a long track-record of taking cost actions when needed and looking forward we plan to take a series of additional aggressive actions which we expect will result in restructuring charges during 2016 and drive benefits in 2017 and beyond.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 10.
During the current quarter we returned over 150% of the capital regenerated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios.
During full year 2015 we returned over $5 billion of capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year and continued to increase our dividend which is now approximately 60% higher than it was in 2011.
Our full year payout ratio of 105% reflects our confidence in the Company’s ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength as well as our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now shift to a discussion of our negotiation efforts on the Costco portfolio sale and our 2016 to 2017 financial outlook.
As we mentioned in our press release and 8-K last Friday given the progress on our portfolio sale discussions we are now reporting the Costco portfolio as held-for-sale in a separate line on our balance sheet.
Given this progress and given the importance of the transaction to our 2016 outlook we have decided to provide a substantive update on the status of the anticipated transaction today.
Clearly since the agreement is not final the update is subject to change.
But we believe an agreement consistent with what I will outline will be signed in the near future.
We now expect there to be a sale and for that sale to close around midyear 2016.
And we expect that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close.
In addition as you would expect we will continue to hold the co-brand loans and co-brand card members will also be able to use their cards at any AmEx accepting merchants through the transaction close date.
We will be paid a premium on the assets when the transaction closes.
The ultimate gain will be determined based on the assets actually sold.
But we currently estimate a gain of approximately $1 billion.
We have not yet signed a definitive agreement and given that we are still several months away from the close and the card member borrowing and pay down trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition the final gain could differ from our estimates.
So now that we’ve concluded 2015 and progressed in our portfolio sale discussions we can provide additional clarity on our 2016 and 2017 EPS outlook.
Because year-over-year growth rates during this period will be complicated by the number and timing of the moving pieces in our results we have focused on the absolute dollar amount of earnings we are targeting in H2.
That said we have not seen volume and revenue growth accelerate as we expected over the past year.
And the competitive economic and regulatory environment has become more challenging.
As a result we have become more cautious in our outlook and now expect our earnings per share during 2016 to be between $5.40 and $5.70.
This now includes a substantial benefit from the portfolio sale gain and the incremental economics associated with the Costco contract extension and also includes the incremental spending on growth initiatives that they are helping fund.
This range excludes the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
This is clearly a change in our expectations.
I can assure you though that we are acting with a strong sense of urgency and confidence and executing on our plans to accelerate revenue growth and even more aggressively reduce our cost base.
To help drive revenue growth we plan to maintain our spending across a range of business opportunities during 2016 at similarly elevated levels to 2015.
I emphasize that while the gain from the portfolio sale will impact us only in the quarter we close the transaction the increased spending on growth initiatives will occur in all four quarters resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance.
On cost as we moved through 2015 and gained more clarity on the portfolio sale as well as our revenue growth outlook it became clear that we needed to accelerate and expand our cost reduction efforts to right-size our cost base with the evolving business environment.
As a result we've launched cost initiatives that are designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion cost by the end of 2017.
To put this into perspective since 2007 our billed business volumes have grown by over 60% but our adjusted operating expenses are almost flat over that period.
We achieved this disciplined cost control by continuously taking actions to increase the overall efficiency of our organization.
Looking forward we determined that those actions were no longer enough and that we needed to be even more aggressive on eliminating cost which is why we are targeting a $1 billion cost reduction.
We plan to take actions throughout 2016 to drive these benefits in 2017 and beyond which we expect to result in restructuring charges this year.
So if you step back and think about our 2016 EPS guidance versus 2015 there are several key items impacting the year-over-year results.
First we expect the underlying business will grow based on our financial model of revenue growth which we believe should accelerate to 2015 levels while with operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second the portfolio sale gain will be partially used to fund a continued elevated level of spending on growth initiatives.
Last when the Costco volumes go away at midyear the marginal contribution will fall away immediately but we will need to maintain certain costs all the way into the first quarter of 2017 to ensure strong customer service.
In addition given the slower than anticipated overall revenue growth we saw in 2015 we will also need to remove more cost to offset the lower revenue which will take some time.
Turning to capital the portfolio sale will increase our capital ratios to a significant reduction in risk related assets.
We plan to leverage this additional capital flexibility to support business building opportunities including growth in the loan portfolio and potential strategic acquisitions.
As you're aware we have been aggressive historically in our capital request through the CCAR process.
Consistent with this approach we plan to consider the opportunity for incremental capital returns related to the portfolio sale as part of our 2016 CCAR submission.
Turning to 2017 we're now targeting to earn at least $5.60 per share.
If you step back and think about this versus our 2016 EPS guidance there are again several key items impacting the year-over-year results.
First we expect the underlying business will again grow based on our simple financial model of revenue growth operating expense leverage and capital returns.
Second we will have to lap the portfolio sale gain along with half year of getting the marginal contribution from the Costco business.
Third our more aggressive cost reduction efforts will be gaining traction reducing our operating expense versus the 2015 adjusted base of $11.3 billion by at least 3%.
And last our spending on growth initiatives will be lower based on the changes we are making to drive further revenue growth more efficient.
Looking beyond 2017 because there are so many moving pieces in the near-term it's difficult to project when we might return to our consistent 12% to 15% earnings per share growth range.
And we point out however that to achieve our 2017 target of $5.60 per share the core will have to be growing at a healthy rate and overall we believe the 12% to 15% EPS growth is still an appropriate long-term target for the organization.
We recognize that we're operating a new reality and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs.
We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.
Now let me turn it back over to Ken so he can provide some additional context.
Thank you Jeff.
And now that Jeff has taken you through our financial outlook let me come back to the questions I set out at the start of the call.
Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long-term? To give context our performance comes against the backdrop of changes that are reshaping the payments industry.
These include a reset in co-brand economics regulatory and competitive pressure on merchant fees and intense competition for customers.
A number of cyclical factors in the broader economy also weighed on our 2015 performance and influenced our outlook for 2016 and 2017.
As Jeff said the economic headwinds we sighted last year including the stronger U.S.
dollar and lower gas prices have lasted longer than we previously said.
This is a long list of challenges longer than we've seen in a number of years we recognize them we've been addressing them with a strong sense of urgency and we're making progress on many fronts.
Over the past 12 to 18 months we took decisive actions in the co-brand space accelerating contract talks with partners we focused on those where we can earn attractive returns and provide strong customer value which led us to deals with Delta Starwood Cathay Pacific British Air and Charles Schwab.
We contained operating expenses and restructured many areas of our business.
Now we’re set to take cost reduction to the next level through our Billion Dollar Improvement program.
We ramped up spending on card member acquisition and brought in 7.7 million new cards in the U.S.
last year.
Our investments here are paying off and we’re now focused on turning those new accounts into additional volumes.
We stepped up investments in our international business with strong results adjusted billed business rose by 12% last year.
We expanded our merchant network adding more than 1.2 million new merchants globally in the past year with our OptBlue program we’re continuing our efforts to move toward parity coverage with the other card networks in the U.S.
We grew our lending business faster than the market while maintaining our industry-best credit performance.
We’ll continue to target new lending prospects and deepen relationships with current customers.
We expanded our digital capabilities with new apps and partnerships to better serve our customers.
We streamlined our management structure creating integrated consumer commercial and merchant teams to accelerate growth.
And taking advantage of our financial strength we’ve returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders last year.
Although 2015 was challenging we did accomplish a lot.
However let me be clear we need to accelerate our efforts and we have a plan to do just that.
It includes three priorities; accelerate revenue growth; reduce our expense base and optimize our investments; and continue to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders.
Let me start with expenses and give you a little more context.
In 2013 we set a goal to limit OpEx growth to 3% or less.
We beat that goal every year since then.
To do this we took a number of restructuring actions that provided benefits in 2015 and will continue to aid us in 2016.
The plan we announced today is a major step up from there.
It targets reducing our overall cost base by $1 billion by the end of 2017.
Along the way we intend to see operating expenses decline by at least 3% from our 2015 base in 2017.
And we expect to see the full benefit in our run rate by the beginning of 2018.
This will involve restructuring actions to streamline the Company starting in the first quarter of this year.
I’ve assigned our Vice Chairman Steve Squeri to lead the effort.
He’ll work with me and our senior leaders in every area of our business to ensure we move quickly and meet our goals.
Steve is one of our most accomplished leaders.
He’s been at the forefront of campaigning our operating expenses over the past several years and has an outstanding track-record of making the organizations he’s led more efficient and more effective.
As this new effort advances we’ll be taking actions to reduce cost in a thoughtful way without compromising our ability to serve our customers meet our compliance obligations and grow the business.
We have a strong history of meeting our reengineering commitments and I am confident we’ll do it again.
At the same time we’re also focused on optimizing our investments.
We’ll continue to use Big Data analytics to improve the way we evaluate prioritize and execute our investment opportunities.
We’ll gain efficiencies from our new management structure and we’ll stop certain initiatives where we’re not seeing results or a clear path to results just as we did by refocusing in our price growth using our investment dollars more efficiently should help us as we move toward a lower level of investment spending in 2017.
As we work to accelerate revenues we’ll be focused on the opportunity I cited earlier.
We’ll invest to grow our card member base and merchant network deepen customer relationships through lending and rewards increase our international presence grow our commercial payments business and develop newer adjacent opportunities like our Loyalty Coalition business.
In addition to organic growth we’ll continue to explore opportunities to grow through acquisitions.
Even with the challenges we faced in 2015 we continue to see underlying growth in the business.
Adjusted revenues rose 4% for the year and we’re confident that we can improve upon this performance.
We have a tremendous set of assets to draw upon; our trusted brand financial strength the advantages of our closed loop world-class customer service and our proven ability to innovate.
Our integrated payments model runs about $1 trillion in spending through our closed loop each year.
That rich data enables us to create value for card members and build the business for our merchant partners.
This is a major advantage and that’s one reason why other card issuers are trying to cobble together a closed loop on their own despite only having a portion of the essential data.
We're not simply looking to do a better job of processing payments we're focused on using our relationships technology and data to better serve our customers and open up commerce opportunities for our partners.
As the boundaries between online and offline blur I believe our business model puts us in a great position to benefit from the conversions of payments and commerce.
We have a deep and experienced management team to guide us forward.
They've been tested by major challenges many times over the years and our Company has always emerged stronger.
You'll hear more about our plans to drive growth from Steve Squeri Anré Williams and Doug Buckminster as well as Jeff and me during Investor Day on March 10th.
Let me conclude by saying we recognize that we're operating in a new reality.
That's why we're focused on the plan I outlined to increase revenues reduce cost and optimize our investments.
We're confident that we can deal with our near-term challenges return to growth and position the Company for long-term success.
Thank you.
Thanks Ken.
As a reminder our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the session.
Therefore before we open up the lines for Q&amp;A I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourselves to just one question.
Thank you for your cooperation in this process.
With that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator.
Thank you very much.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Don Vendetti with Citigroup.
Please go ahead.
Yes Jeff can you confirm in terms of the '16 guidance do you have an incremental payout ratio assumed in there from the gain or do you not have that built in yet? Well I think Don it's fair to say we take our best shot at estimating what we think a reasonable capital return is based on our view of our capital strength and our opportunities.
Of course as you well know we'll have to see if the Fed agrees with this but certainly what we have built-in is what we think is a very healthy return on capital.
Right and then of 1 billion of expense cuts clearly the Costco is a big piece of the portfolio 20% you'd expect some cost reduction from that.
Can you sort of help us think about how much of the billion is sort of Costco related versus sort of core business? Well the way I guess I would answer that Don and I'd remind you Costco is 20% of our loans and look our net interest income is only about 18% of our income statement so they are about 8% of our billings for the co-brand another 1% for other merchant acceptance.
I think the broader way to really think about it is that as Ken said in his remarks we recognize that there are many things that have changed in the environment we are in and as we have gone through 2015 we have not seen the revenue acceleration that we had expected to see.
If you go back to our Investor Day in March if you go back to the original conference call we did last February when Ken and I talked about our decision to walk away from the Costco agreement we said we're going to have to see how much other volumes ramp-up and what the pace is of that ramp and exactly what the final outcome is of when the Costco portfolio goes away and in what way well we have those answers now and when you put all of that together with the evolving environment that we are in we concluded we need to be much more aggressive about all aspects of our cost base.
So I don’t think Don you can really attribute it to any one factor it's the confluence of all the things that Ken and I talked about this afternoon.
Yes I would just add to what Jeff said is that one we recognized early that the economics of the co-brand marketplace were changing and certainly that competitor pressures throughout the industry were likely to increase and that's one of the reasons Don that we initiated two separate restructuring initiatives in 2014 which was well before we knew how our Costco negotiations would come out and I think those initiatives certainly helped us to hold OpEx growth below our target again flat in 2015.
Then in February as we talked about we recognized that the termination of the Costco relationship was going to create a short-term volume and revenue gap and that's why we said it's possible that we take an additional restructuring charge.
We know what the situation is now but that also would be based impart on the revenue and volumes growth that we saw in other parts of our business.
And as Jeff said in his opening remarks the revenue and billings growth is not accelerated as we would have expected and so we're working to right-size the course of the cost base there are variable costs that we can take out relatively quickly but there are fixed costs as well and that's going to take time to transition but I think that the reengineering plan that we have put in place gives us a lot of confidence that we can realize the cost objectives that we have put in place and we can do it in a way that is not going to impair our ability very importantly to build on the range of growth opportunities that we’ve identified.
Thank you.
Out next question that will come from Ken Bruce with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch please go ahead.
Okay Mr.
Bruce your line is open.
Please check your mute key.
Encouraging on the card acquisitions in the quarter and the year I guess as you’ve been looking at what is kind of the center piece of that growth is that coming from premium cards credit cards star cards.
Could you give us any sense as to what is underlying that growth please? I think Ken what is very pleasing to us and this goes back to the broad range of opportunities set we have we clearly are pleased with the growth we’re seeing in against premium cards.
We also have a very good small business franchise.
International as we’ve said is performing well for us.
Certainly what we are benefiting from is to have a variety of card growth initiatives.
So very frankly it is really across the board that we’re seeing this card acquisition growth.
And certainly the point that we have emphasized it’s one thing to get the cards and we’re excited and we think we’re getting the right types of cards.
But we also have a demonstrated track-record of in fact generating spending on those cards.
And that’s very important.
But what I would say the headline would be that we feel very good about the growth that we’re seeing across the franchise.
The next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Please go ahead.
I guess I want to reconcile the commentary on the weaker revenue growth trajectory into 2016 and 2017.
I guess we knew kind of the co-brand reset and the regulatory backdrop and I understand the economic environmental a bit weaker.
But is it really mainly coming from the competitive environment affecting the business? And maybe you could just specifically talk about what’s changed over the last three to six months that’s really affecting your outlook.
And then when we think about strategic acquisitions maybe you can just talk about what you guys are anticipating in terms of size and where exactly an acquisition might fit into the business? Thank you.
Sanjay let me just go back and explain how things have evolved over the last year and then Ken you might want to provide a little broader context.
As you think about the course of 2015 we clearly did have an expectation that you would a significant sequential strengthening in both volumes and revenues.
And as we went through the year that clearly did not happen.
As we thought about that Sanjay in the context of our forward outlook at some point when revenues weaken a little bit as you know we have a financial model that has lots of levers and we can pull those levers at different times.
With regards to the end of the year though and looked at a full year revenue growth not being where we thought it would be we concluded it didn’t make sense to pull the levers as hard as we would have had to pull them to get to where we had hoped to get to in 2016 and ’17.
And so we’ve adjusted course.
So I think there is many-many drivers of that slower revenue growth which Ken and I tried to get in our remarks but Ken you probably want to provide a little broader context.
Yes I would I think what’s important is while certainly Sanjay the revenues and the volumes are not where we want them to be.
I would just go back if we look at the competitive environment and look at the large issuers.
We are at least generating an adjusted 4% growth rate against the backdrop of a more challenging economic environment.
And as we have continued to maintain over the last several years a intensifying competitive environment what we’ve seen from our large issuing peers is despite the investments they’re making and the billings growth they’re not achieving much revenue growth.
So our revenue growth is certainly better I’d like it in fact to be accelerated and we believe it will in 2015.
I think again the investments that we’ve made in card acquisitions have frankly been performing in general in line with our expectations.
Now we are constantly reviewing our investment alternatives and while allocating those dollars we believe we can generate the best returns.
And I think as we’ve said when some of those initiatives are not working enterprise growth was an example of that.
What I’ve also been pleased with is the increasing way that we are using our technology and our data analytics to improve our marketing programs and to make them more effective.
So I think there is always some lead time as we have talked about between when we are making investments and when we see the returns but I think it's not just the sign post that we've seen in card in bringing in new cards but it's also some of the sign posts that we're seeing in some of the services and capabilities that we're providing something like pay with points which we're seeing from a standpoint of young people there is an attraction and engagement to those programs.
I think what we've done with some of our digital partnerships I think the progress that we've made with OptBlue and then I go back to what I think has been very strong performance in a range of international markets.
So I think that that's the balance.
Can I just kind of summarize if you think about 2015 Sanjay you had oil that kept going lower you had FX that kept going against us the economy was weaker than people thought and you have accumulative impact of regulation and competition.
All that said as we get into 2016 for all the reasons Ken talked about our expectation and you should expect to see some acceleration in our volume and revenue growth trends beginning in the first quarter.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous.
Please go ahead.
Ken we don’t often get you on a call so I think a long-term question seems appropriate historically AmEx has been a trade of premium to peers due to its spend centric discount revenue having modeled.
Now we're hearing about ramped up pressure on the discount rate and aggressive lending growth against a backdrop.
As an industry quickly moving toward giving up interchange economics to drive loan growth and share gains so my real question is concerning the competitive backdrop and the change in how your competitors are looking at their economics how can you maintain the model long-term that has traditionally allowed AmEx to be valued at a premium to competitors? Well I think that's Craig a multi-layered question so let me hit it on some different pathways as we go forward.
I think one is if you look at the issuing side of the business and you focus on the spend centric versus the lend centric I go back to a point that Jeff made in talking about the fourth quarter results and certainly we have said this in the past if you look at net interest income as a percentage of revenues that range is around 15% to 20% in the fourth quarter it was 18%.
So at the end of the day the progress that we're making on lending and I should add to that growing better than the industry with industry leading credit performance and I think we're getting good spending on those cards I think that is working well for us as I look at it on the issuing path.
So I feel pretty good about the viability of our spend centric model.
The second thing that I would say is that the nature of just focusing on specific customer segments and just focusing on one geography in the U.S.
so what's interesting is when you look at small business and I think you know this in 2014 $4.8 trillion were spent by small businesses but only 10% of that was on plastic and where we are the market leader in small business.
So I think that it's not just the payment industry dynamics that we're competing with in this case we're competing against cash checks and the fact that only 10% of 4.8 trillion is on plastic suggests there's a strong opportunity I can do the same thing in middle market.
Then I go to international and I look at a range of markets where the penetration against plastic is relatively low and we've actually achieved pretty good growth rate so 12% in billings growth in a number of markets we're growing faster than the market.
So I think when you look at the breadth of our portfolio in consumer small business and corporate and the geographic and the fact that we are competing also against cash and checks.
That gives me some confidence relative to both the growth and the economics.
Now I will absolutely admit that's why I started off there's a reset on co-brand economics.
That certainly is a challenge but we are not overly dependent on co-brands and we have a range of opportunities that we are pursuing.
On the merchant side let's be very clear Visa and MasterCard have different models at this point in time those models are working pretty well for them but as I look at our opportunities going forward I think there is a sea change going on in payments and commerce.
So certainly they provide an important part of the payments process but I think increasingly it's going to be very important to have direct relationships with consumers and merchants and we think direct relationships in the inside the information that we have from card members and merchants is going to be even more valuable as the convergence of online and offline commerce continues.
And so building on the relationships inherent in our integrated model provides the foundation we think to deliver strong value to our shareholders.
So I think that that is going to be an important development as we go forward.
What I would also say is that when you look at the value that we provide and certainly regulation is playing a role in the merchant business.
But I do want to avoid sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison between the Visa and MasterCard rate structure which is enormously complicated and that varies significantly by product.
And I would say that our merchant rates really do reflect the value that we provide.
And so the fact that as you know card member spending is 3 to 4 times the amount on Visa and MasterCard I think Visa has consistently increased their prices in the nation groups and that obviously is a dynamic there.
But when I relate that to the importance of how we drive value going forward and direct relationships that we have with the end-user customer and the merchant and the changes in commerce I think that we have the ability to compete.
So you’ve got to look at the breadth of the portfolio and the number of levers that we have to pull.
Our next question in queue will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead.
I guess I was struck by the comment that you expect that in 2017 the level of marketing and rewards could be reduced as you kind of lap some of those investments.
You talked about how much that could be.
And maybe relate the level of rewards that are on the cards that you’re offering to these new consumers to what your current cost of rewards is? All right Moshe to be clear rewards were not what I was referencing.
What we’re talking about is when you look across the range of things we spend in the market and promotional area and the operating expense area.
When we look at our evolving digital acquisition our evolving use of Big Data when we look at certain markets Ken just talked about the breadth of our business model where in fact we’re increasingly finding the use of direct salesforces to be a more effective way to grow than certain of our more traditional marketing and promotional efforts we absolutely look at that from our marketing and promotional line and see a pathway to moderate down the level of spend without losing any ability to grow revenues.
And so as we think about taking the billion dollars out of the cost base we very consciously have said while the majority of that will certainly come out of operating expenses.
There are instances where in fact it makes more economic sense for us to pull down marketing and promotional expenses and actually grow operating expenses.
And we want the flexibility to do the right thing to drive revenue growth going forward.
I’d just say two or three things Jeff is one what we’ve seen on the operating expense side if I just take small business and middle market what we’ve seen is the expansion of our salesforce the return on that has been substantial even though that adds to OpEx that is a very-very good trade-off that we want to make.
But I just come back on the rewards point because there’re different categories of rewards.
There is cash back there is co-brands and the reality is if you look at how we’ve managed the cost for example of membership rewards I think we’ve been able to manage those costs very well.
When we look at the engagement of our customers on membership rewards it’s been very strong.
So I mentioned that that segment of 30 and under is very attracted to pay with points.
And so the deals we’ve done with Airbnb and Uber are very attractive to that segment.
And one of the reasons why is because we have a program that’s over 20 years old and in fact we have a very large number of points in our bank.
So I think as with other categories when you look at rewards you’ve got a segment and you’ve got to look at the economics of cash back you’ve got to look at co-brands as we’ve talked about and certainly the margins have been squeezed more in co-brands.
But the fact that we have a very broad-based rewards program that we continue to evolve we’ve made more digital we’ve made more mobile I think gives us a flexibility in how we manage the overall reward gains of our customers.
Thank you.
We’ll move on to our next question and that will come from Bill Carache with Nomura.
Please go ahead.
Could you clarify for us the core EPS number what that is for 2016 excluding any gain net of reinvestment? And the reason for the question is that some investors that we've spoken with are stripping out the $1 billion Costco gain or about $0.66 a share to get to kind of what they're calling a core EPS number for 2016.
The math I've seen is people are using the midpoint of your 2016 guidance to get to above $4.89 that would imply negative 9% year-over-year growth for '16 and then they're comparing that to kind of what you had previously been guiding to the modestly positive EPS growth I think consensus of about plus 2%.
Maybe could you give a little bit of clarity around that just so there's not I guess speculation around how much of '16 is being influenced by or I guess inflated by the gain? Yes so I think Bill the way to think about it is as I said in my remark we are -- we will use the gain partially to remain at the more elevated level of growth oriented spending that we were at in 2015 and then in fact Moshe was just talking to us about in terms of how we will rationally pull it down through 2017.
That is a change if I go back to the way we first talked about 2016 in February and March last year at our Investor Day our assumption had been we will begin to moderate that growth oriented spending down in 2016.
As the gain has come in as we've looked at all the things going on in the Company we have made the decision that the right thing to do for the long-term is to stay at that higher level.
Now in terms of the exact amount I guess if there's a little bit of judgment Bill involved in that certainly a very substantial piece of the gain is being used to keep our investments up at a higher level is it all the gain probably not is it the majority of the gain probably I'm hesitant to put a firm number on it because that's not reflective of how we run the Company we look at the range of opportunities we have that we think make sense either shareholders' money on for the long-term we are funding those up very fully in 2016 and that soaks up a good portion of the gain.
Yes the point I would make Jeff is that American Express has had a velocity of how we've used gains overtime and where we see growth opportunities and those of you who followed the Company for a while might recall that we had a fairly substantial gain over a multiyear period in the Visa MasterCard private action and so the damages claim was in I think the first amount charged was probably $1 billion I think it was $3 billion in total I can't remember it exactly but the reality is that we believe we had a range of opportunities to invest in growing our business middle market was an example and small business and I think what we demonstrated is we used those gains in a very-very productive way.
So when I look at what we can do relative to adding new card members deepening customer relationships from a lending reward standpoint we believe even though commercial payments had a slower year in 2015 we see that as an area for investment going forward.
So this has been pretty consistent that where we have seen opportunities either to make investments in technology platforms or from a growth standpoint we've done that and I think we've had a pretty good track-record of basically achieving the outcomes that we set out to.
Thank you.
Our next question queued that will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead.
I guess two unrelated questions.
Given everything that we're hearing in the economy around corporate particularly the industrial economy any material weakness that you're seeing across any sectors and I guess specific for you Ken given the planning you laid out today can you just talk about how management incentives are aligned with delivering on the plan? What I would say Ryan is our managements and it start with pay with performance and so what we have is very clear objectives around each of our businesses whether that's consumer commercial merchant international.
We obviously factor in what are some of the external factors that we need to weigh but we have very clear objectives that we have set for the Company overall and for particular businesses.
And I think we have a demonstrated track-record that we hold our people accountable.
So what we have not had is a situation that someone simply says that it will be certainly will be reflected in our compensation is because it's a challenging economic environment that people get a pass that’s not the way we operate as a Company.
On the other side there are different strategic initiatives and particular areas that we’re going to make multiyear investments in and we established certain signposts to judge the effectiveness and the performance of those activities.
And it is a very rigorous process that we very consistently review not only as a management team but with our Board and the comp committee in particular on a regular basis throughout the year.
And then just on the other part of the question around what you’re seeing from corporates any particular sectors of weakness? I think as we’ve said hopefully we believe that we’ll see some improvement but I think we’ve been very clear throughout the year that I would say the segments that I’ve been most disappointed in has been the corporate segment.
And I think you have heard me say this before through the years that the easiest expense category to cut is T&amp;E that’s the first thing you see.
Then you start to see people cutting on technology investments.
And we hope that we’ll see some improvements in that in 2016.
But as I evaluate 2014 that was an area that in the beginning of the year we started off in a better place and we saw a pretty consistent decline.
And certainly what we’ve seen in my 30 plus years experience with the Company is cut backs in T&amp;E tends to be an early indicator for a slowdown.
And I am not sure what will happen going forward.
But what we do believe is we’ll see some improvement in the growth in commercial in 2016.
Thank you.
Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair.
Please go ahead.
A question I guess Jeff you sounded pretty confident and Ken about accelerating growth in 2016 starting in the first quarter that’s kind of an unusual statement in an environment where the markets are very jittery about decelerating economic growth.
What gives you confidence in seeing accelerating growth in 2016 to build it into your plan and even say that you would see it in the first quarter? Well I think I’d maybe answer that in two parts.
So something it closed in is the first quarter Bob you really look at just some of the things that is happening right.
So FX while still a headwind for us is not as big a headwind as you get into the first quarter.
We’ll see what happens with oil prices.
A couple of weeks ago I would have told you I think they’re going to -- we’re going to get to a lapping point on oil prices although those have gotten a little bit of tougher.
And then when you just look at some other things going on in our business including Costco Canada the areas that we have been focused on throughout 2015 in terms of spending and the trends we’re seeing we do think that as soon as Q1 you should see some acceleration in the year-over-year volume trends that you’ve been seeing.
As you think more broadly across the year I mean certainly we worry about all the same broad macroeconomic risks and trends that you talked about.
But we are just balancing that against all the other things that we’re doing to try to accelerate revenue growth.
And the fact that 2015 was another year of not particularly great growth and yet we still got on an FX adjusted basis to 4% revenue growth and we think we can do better than that in 2016.
And are you counting on an acceleration in GDP growth to get to those numbers? Yes of course… Not no no.
And then you’re clearly not seeing a deceleration then in the pieces of your business in line with some of the concerns you’re not seeing strong trends necessarily but you’re not seeing you’re not concerned about the U.S.
economy going into recession for example? Yes here is what I would say Bob is we are not seeing decelerating trends.
We’re certainly not seeing in the overall economic catalyst that would say that we think there are going to be improvements in GDP growth.
But I think the indicators that and the reasons that Jeff cited we are really focused on our business model and the reasons why we think we’ll see improved revenue growth.
And I would keep it at that.
I think as with most people I don’t think we are of the view that we're going to see a dramatic change in the improvement in the U.S.
economy.
We hope things hold and I would say we hope certainly I'm not predicting that things will get a little bit better but I certainly would not bank our plan on seeing a dramatic improvement in GDP growth that's certainly not an assumption at all that we are making for our plan.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Chris Brendler with Stifel.
Please go ahead.
Ken you mentioned the acquisitions of the potential growth strategy earlier in the call and I just wanted to see if you could give us any color on the potential areas of focus.
You also mentioned the importance of being closer to the merchant and I was wondering if you've ever looked at the private label space as the potential area of expansion anything closer to merchants through proprietary closed loop card within a merchant at this point? And sort of second question just clarify for '17 is there any anticipated impact in your guidance from Starwood and also from the European interchange reductions? Is that a net positive or a negative in your view? Thanks.
Let me quickly Chris take the latter two and then Ken you should chat about the M&amp;As.
Question is certainly in '15 you see an impact from European deregulation because while we're not subject to the interchange caps the reality is as we've said for a while it puts some downward pressure on our discount rate as we really believe our merchants who saw that impact in '15 have to see a little bit more of it in '16 probably get -- need to get all the way to '17 before we fully lap that space into all of our thoughts.
On Starwood we'll have to see we think we do a great job and have a great partner for Starwood we think we have a great partnership and I think SPG is one of the assets that Marriott is acquiring but we'll have to see over the longer term exactly where Marriott decides to take the two programs.
Yes so I would just say on private label I don’t see that as an area that we're going to pursue.
I think as we talked about there are aspects of non-card lending both in consumer and commercial that we're certainly taking a look at and I think we believe that we have a range of opportunities as we look at lending we don’t think we're getting our fair share of blend from existing customers that we have and we see that as an opportunity.
I think that private label you got to think through the different cycles and as we look at the different cycles in private lending in private label lending we actually think that we can have more balanced growth and have a more balanced risk profile in the way that we are conducting our lending strategy.
I would just say to add a little bit on Starwood and then I'll talk about how we're looking at acquisitions overall that I would emphasize and I think it is certainly one of the reasons why Marriott made the deal is they were very-very focused on the high quality customer that Starwood has SPG which is what their co-branded card is called is viewed very positively.
You may or may not know when the deal was announced there was a lot of buzz on social media from the Starwood SPG customers saying we really love this product there were a lot of good things said about AmEx.
I had a lot of respect for the Marriott management and I think our job as we've been doing is to provide really-really strong value and if we do that I think we're going to be fine so that' what we're going to be focused on.
On the acquisition side the reality is as we look at a range of different opportunities I think the loyalty partner example is a very good one.
One we see it as a very manageable acquisition but it also plays off a number of the capabilities and takes advantage of the merchant relationships that we have and what you know in the loyalty partner model that I think is quite attractive is the merchant actually funds the reward on loyalty partner.
And so we're in the early stages as you know with the Plenti launch we actually announced I think it was two days ago that Chile's restaurant chain has come on and part of what you want with this program we've got Macy's AT&amp;T ExxonMobil nationwide a range of companies if you want to get people a range of redemption options where they can buy something in one place redeem somewhere else and having the different need categories and that is very important so we're very happy to have Chile's in the Plenti program.
But I do think as we look at the merchant side as we look at consumer as we look at commercial we think there are a range of opportunities of that obviously if we feel they’re going to leverage some of the assets and capabilities or bring us some of the assets and capabilities what we would look as we looked at with loyalty partner is can they substantially improve the size and scale and the growth of those businesses.
And so that’s the philosophy that we’re going to take from an acquisition standpoint.
Thank you very much.
Our next question will come from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.
Please go ahead.
Two related questions for guidance for 2016.
Jeff I thought you said something about restructuring charges being part of expenses embedded in the guidance.
I am wondering if you could quantify that at all.
And then also on one of the sort of headwinds you’re facing for 2016 on the regulation side.
Is it all regulation like Europeans stuff that was just discussed? Or is it also the anti-trust litigation and an anti-steering rule sort of embedded in what you put under the heading of regulation? Thanks.
So the specific things on regulation really that we’re referring to Chris are around the European regulation which went into effect in early December as well as some new rulings in Australia and that will also impact our business.
So that’s really the main driver there.
In terms of 2016 guidance to be very clear as we said in the press release our 5.40 to 5.70 range does not include any potential restructuring charges.
I did say and I would expect that it is likely we will take restructuring charges in 2016 at this point while we have lots of work streams that have been underway for a while.
We are not at the point where we can estimate those charges and therefore give you any sense of them which is why we didn’t feel comfortable trying to build it into any guidance.
That said if you might just if you look at history as Ken said earlier we have over the last couple of years done a number of restructurings and those probably give you a reasonable range to think about.
The only other point Jeff I would make is obviously I think most people are aware of the second circuit court of appeals which issued an order granting a temporary stay of the trial court’s injunction.
And so what that means is as long as that order remains in effect American Express is no longer subject to the trial court’s injunction.
And so that means that we are entitled to enforce the pre-injunction non-discrimination provisions.
And so we’re obviously awaiting the pallet court’s decision which we don’t know when will be coming out.
But I think that was an important development that occurred towards the end of the year.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.
Obviously a lot of talk about what premium multiple or if that still exists versus other card issuers and specifically obviously you have a advantage on the spend centric model.
But particularly have been rewarded for an above average growth rate versus peers.
So if I think about your 12% to 15% target through the year is it basically on an underlying basis it’s not a realistic target for 2017 or is it and do you plan to provide additional visibility on the underlying growth rate of earnings maybe ex-Costco and a lot of the moving pieces from here through ’17? So David we will do everything we can.
We did chose to go to absolute levels of EPS because there are so many moving pieces in our results as you go through the ’15 to ’16 to ’17 time frame but it is very difficult I think for people to make sense of just talking about growth rates.
As I said in my remarks so if you carefully do the math you only get to the at least 5.60 in earnings per share that we’re targeting in 2017 if you have what I recall a very healthy core growth rate as you move from ’16 to ’17.
In ’15 alone and I would point out directing people through the math if you think about the 5% or so of EPS that’s a co-brand reset cost that’s which will lap FX impact of 3% to 4% and then the $0.10 or so was about 2 points of EPS growth that 2014 had it as the net gain from chief global business travel and Concur transactions.
So if you ended up with a core that’s growing not quite where we would think a still appropriate consistent target is 12% to 15% but showing pretty good growth.
And to get to that 2017 number you’re going to have to better the math and get out the acceleration and revenue growth that Ken and I talked about.
So to try to put a specific number on it gets I think very confusing and you start to run together what’s part of our billion dollar cost reduction versus normal OpEx leverage and that’s -- it is a combination of those things that led us to say here is just the absolute numbers we think we can get to.
I think Jeff where it does go to is really the underlying strength of the business model.
As you pointed out relative to the performance in 2015 and as we talked about what we see as the opportunity is going forward in 2016 and 2017.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
I just wanted to sort of follow-up on the revenue growth question and spend a little bit more time on the MDR guidance and looking for that to be a little bit more severe compression than what we saw this year.
Can you just help us think about some of the moving pieces there in terms of relative impact? Is it coming more from the international piece is it more OptBlue as that continues to build out? And sort of on the flip side of that as we talk about continuing to build out the acceptance piece is there an acceleration in timeline as to when you expect to get to parity relative to Visa MasterCard? So three things Cheryl on my specific comment that we do expect to see more year-over-year decline in the discount rates in 2016.
The drivers are really just what you said; number one OptBlue as we continue to build it out the cumulative impact does grow a little larger as you get into 2016.
We continue to believe that program is good for us economically.
We passed the breakeven point in 2015 and we think we are making great progress in that program too.
You do see a greater impact in 2016 from the regulation in Europe and its impact on merchant negotiations as I talked about earlier.
And three you do have some mix issues right.
So in the first half of the year oddly enough as we completely finish lapping Costco in Canada that was helping our year-over-year discount rate a little bit in 2015.
As you have seen a little bit less growth in the corporate card business that tends to be spending at a mix of merchants that tends to be a little bit higher in terms of discount rate and as growth in the U.S.
has been a little slower than it has been historically relative to the U.S.
that also causes puts a little bit of pressure on the discount rates from a mix perspective.
So it’s all of those things that drove the comment I made about expecting a larger year-over-year discount rate decline in 2016.
And then Ken you might want to comment and cover it up a little.
Yes I mean the point I would make is Cheryl I can’t give you a specific timeframe but the farthest I’ll go is to say it is several years which certainly 10 years ago I wouldn’t even come close to saying it’s several years.
I think we’ve made some really strong progress I’ve been pleased with the momentum that we’ve seen with OptBlue I just reinforced what Jeff said is the growing mix of business within the retail and everyday sector is obviously very critical to the expansion of OptBlue and obviously some of the regulation that we’re seeing in some of the key international markets.
But as we’ve talked about before the increased coverage also has an impact on improving the perception of coverage which should help our growth.
Now that takes time for perception to catch up with reality.
And to the earlier point that Jeff made if we can start to see some improvement in the corporate business that’s going to help.
But we consciously understood that with expansion of OptBlue we were going to have a greater mix of retail and every day and that’s something that we want to see because that increases the utility of our acquired products.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from David Togut with Evercore.
Please go ahead.
For 2016 could you please quantify the elevated spending on growth initiatives break it down in each of the major buckets of spending.
And then walk us forward into 2017 giving us a sense of how each of these major buckets of spending will change.
And in particular I am wondering how you can reduce spending on these areas particularly given the more competitive environment you talked about a tougher economy and a tougher regulatory environment? Thanks.
Well David the shorter answer is no I am not going to walk you through that level of detail because we would consider it competitively sensitive to be that precise about the areas we’re targeting that there’re opportunities and also because as the world changes it’s very important that we retain flexibility to react to the evolving environment and we go back to the things I talked about earlier what makes us believe we can moderate spending without losing our ability to run revenues well it is due evolving use of Big Data the growth in the percentage of our new card acquisitions that comes from digital channels that are very efficient and it's through focusing on the areas of greatest opportunity.
The only point I’d make Jeff and I would say we’re in an even better situation because of the progress we’ve made on data analytics and performance marketing.
But if we go back over the last 15 years the reality is we’ve gone through periods of elevated spending where we saw opportunities and then we’ve reaped the benefits three or four or five years down the road even when we have moved down those level spending.
So we have an opportunity and we’re taking advantage of it.
And I would say the analytics and the capabilities that we’ve developed give me confidence that we’ll take advantage of those opportunities and the efficiencies that we have brought to bear in our business over the last several years have really produced good results.
So we feel that that dynamic is something that we can continue.
And we’re going to continue to push very aggressively.
Thank you.
Our next question in queue will come from Aaron Rabinovich with D.A.
Davidson.
Please go ahead.
Just a point of clarification on the expenses I think in Ken’s remarks he said that you expect operating expenses to decline by at least 3% from the 2015 base.
Is the 2015 base just your GAAP total which includes spending around 519 million of onetime charges just trying to get a better understanding of that? Yes so to be very precise think about 2015 base of 11.3 which takes out those doesn’t really include the Q4 charge.
And so as we think about the billion dollar cost target the reality is we’ve done the easy stuff.
It will take until the end of 2017 to get to a full run rate but if you think about full year 2017 results we should get at least down 3% below 2015.
So operator we’ll take one more question.
Thank you sir that will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays.
Please go ahead.
Just one quick follow-up on Starwood do you have any provisions in your program partnerships with whether it’d be a Starwood or a Delta that preclude or limit the co-brand partners’ ability to dilute the value of the points by changing and on our redemption options? And then just one follow-up on the guidance what does it contemplate in terms of FX and provisions for 2016? So we’ll split this up I’ll do Starwood and I’ll have Jeff talk about FX obviously it would be totally inappropriate for me to go in to the terms of the contract.
But what I would say that’s very clear is that if you have a group of customers that in fact have relied on getting very strong value for a product the last thing you want to do is diminish the value of the product.
And as I said earlier and not just from us but if you look at independent card surveys the SBT product is one of the highest rated products from a value standpoint.
So I think that the Marriott people are very customer centric very smart and I don’t think they would have done this deal if the objective was to dilute the value of products to some of their most important customers.
So that would just be my perspective I don’t have any information from them there.
But I do know in some of what I have read publicly they have talked about their excitement about having this size of customer and the value that they put on it.
And so that would be my perspective.
And on FX our comments today are based on the world as it exists today.
And so we basically presume all of the increase or strength of the U.S.
dollar that you’re seeing today but not that it continues to get worse.
On provision we’ve been very consistent in saying.
We see a continued pathway to have loan growth grow at a good cliff.
Obviously provision will grow with it.
And as we continue to get the cumulative impact of a lot of really good growth in loans then you have a different mix more early tenure folks.
And so there is a little bit of seasoning that will also drive these provision rates up a bit.
So that’s all built into the commentary we made today.
Great.
