Good morning.
My name is Candy and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International First Quarter 2011 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you Mr.
Cunningham.
You may begin your conference.
Thank you and good morning everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's financial review together with the earnings press release and our 10-Q filings are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
This afternoon we'll be posting on our website our quarterly business update presentation and we use these slides in the regular order for our ongoing investor discussions.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
[Operator Instructions] With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good morning everyone.
Our first quarter results are fully consistent with our 2011 outlook.
Core earnings were $0.62 per share compared to $0.82 per share last year due to the expected loss of Edison Mission Group.
Southern California Edison delivered a 10% increase in earnings to $0.68 per share reflecting continued growth in rate base as SCE implements its multibillion dollar capital program.
We are also reaffirming our core earnings guidance for 2011 of $2.60 to $2.90 per share with a midpoint of $2.75 per share.
Jim will provide some additional detail on our financial results in his remarks.
I would like to review a few key developments that have occurred thus far this year starting with SCE's 2012 to 2014 General Rate Case.
In early March the CPUC approved the timeline for the rate case which still calls for a commission decision by year-end.
As with our last rate case should the case carry over into the next year we have received CPUC approval to make any rate case decision retroactive to January 1 2012.
We will shortly be moving into a phase in the case involving intervenor testimony and responses along with public hearings.
Last week SCE made an important procedural filing to reduce its revenue request primarily to reflect last year's tax law change on bonus depreciation.
Tragic events in Japan have increased the public's focus on nuclear power generation including at our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
SONGS continues to operate normally and safely.
We are assessing events in Japan and beginning a thorough process of evaluating the causes of the nuclear part of the disaster.
We and the entire U.S.
nuclear industry are working to glean every insight we can from the Japanese experience and then make any necessary improvements to equipment procedures and emergency preparedness planning.
The SONGS' design basis including seismic and tsunami events is conservative and of course meets all NRC requirements.
San Onofre's reactor cores are housed in 4 to 8-foot thick reinforced concrete and steel-lined containment structures.
Similarly the spent fuel storage pools are housed in seismically-designed concrete structures.
In an emergency regardless of the cause it's critical that the plant can shut down safely contain any radiological release and keep the nuclear fuel cool.
To accomplish this the plant has multiple redundant backup systems that can operate even in the event of a loss of electric power for an extended period of time.
Additionally multiple emergency measures have been introduced over the years especially after 9/11.
Seismic analyses updated in 1995 and again in 2009 have reconfirmed the design basis of the plant.
This research also determined that the maximum credible tsunami at San Onofre is 23 feet.
Our tsunami wall is 30-feet high.
However not wanting to leave any stone unturned on April 15 SCE filed a previously planned request with the CPUC to authorize funding for additional seismic research using the latest 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional technologies.
This work will also provide support to any future capital required at SONGS for its continued safe operation and any request we may seek in the future for license renewal beyond 2022.
We continue to recover through rates all of our investment in SONGS such as the previously completed steam generator replacements based on the current expiration of the license in 2022.
While on the subject of license renewal it's worth noting that on April 21 the NRC approved the license renewal for the Palo Verde Nuclear Station where we have a 16% or 621-megawatt ownership interest.
I'd also like to comment on California's recently enacted legislation targeting 33% renewable energy by 2020.
We believe this should be an achievable goal but one that will be challenging and comparatively expensive.
Meeting this goal requires policies that support the integration of these new technologies into the electric grid recognizing the realities of intermittency of renewables resource location and the need for increasing transmission in a timely manner.
Transmission remains SCE's key investment priority in meeting the 33% renewables requirement because the vast majority of untapped renewable resources are in its service territory and transmission remains a bottleneck to delivering 33% renewables power.
Planning for implementation will be complicated by California's once-through cooling water policy which is more stringent than the recently proposed U.S.
EPA rules.
By 2020 California's rules may affect up to 7 000 megawatts of IPP-owned gas-fired generation important for managing renewables intermittency in SCE's territory.
Maintaining grid reliability will probably require repowering some of these sites or citing new generation.
Turning to Edison Mission Group.
We continue to work hard to unlock the equity value we see in this business.
Our priorities remain enhancing liquidity and financial flexibility addressing the challenges of the coal fleet and diversifying the portfolio through our renewables development platform.
Although EMG reported a $0.05 loss in the quarter it continues to generate positive cash flow and EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA was $106 million in the first quarter.
EMG continues to make decisions that maintain a solid liquidity position as it increased cash and investments over the quarter to almost $1.2 billion.
We continue to fine-tune EMG's capital spending program including optimizing capital spending for emissions controls at Midwest Generation to meet all commitments to the Illinois EPA in the time frames agreed.
Our wind construction program actually netted positive cash proceeds in the quarter as projects utilized the U.S.
Treasury Grant Program.
A major event in the quarter was the release of U.S.
EPA's draft Hazardous Air Pollutant Rule or the so-called HAPs MACT rule.
The section covering mercury emissions proposed the same emission limits as contained in our 2006 Illinois Combined Pollutant Standards agreement for Midwest Generation 0.008 pounds per gigawatt hour.
We installed the necessary equipment back in 2009 and are already achieving these limits.
U.S.
EPA's rule contained other draft provisions covering acid gases and non-mercury metals which we can meet by installing the pollution control equipment we have been planning to use at Midwest Gen to meet our SO2 emissions commitments to the Illinois EPA.
Finally EMG continues to make good progress building out its renewables platform.
In April EMG commenced construction of a 55-megawatt wind generation project in West Virginia called the Pinnacle project.
This marks EMG's 30th project and now has nearly 2 000 megawatts of wind generation in operation or construction in 11 states.
EMG intends to remain active in developing new projects as we look to partner with one or more financial institutions to fund additional good-quality projects while leveraging our 3 700-megawatt pipeline and strong development team.
With that I'll turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thanks Ted and good morning everyone.
Page 2 of the presentation summarizes first quarter GAAP and core earnings.
Ted has already summarized the core results.
Both periods had minor non-core impacts from EMG's discontinued operation and last year's first quarter included a $0.12 per share charge at SCE related to healthcare reform.
Page 3 reflects SCE's first quarter financial performance which is consistent with our guidance that rate base growth will drive higher earnings at the utility.
The $0.06 per share increase came largely from higher authorized CPUC and FERC revenues.
The CPUC revenue increase is the attrition mechanism which increases 2011 authorized revenues by 4.35% and other approved investments such as the Edison SmartConnect and SONGS steam generator replacement.
The FERC revenue increase is mainly due to the implementation of the 2010 General Rate Case decision and construction work in process or CWIP return on transmission investment.
I'd also like to touch briefly on SCE's 2012 General Rate Case.
Last week SCE updated its GRC application to incorporate specific changes including the impact of the 100% bonus depreciation for years 2012 '13 and '14.
In investor materials we provided for our fourth quarter 2010 earnings call we included the estimated impact of SCE's rate base of 100% bonus depreciation.
Based on recently issued IRS guidelines for 100% bonus we are now confirming that our previous rate base forecast is consistent with these regulations.
As part of SCE's updated filing the utility also removed the seismic study costs for SONGS to a separate proceeding.
Together these changes lowered SCE's requested increase by $38 million in 2012 $133 million in 2013 and $145 million in 2014.
Page 28 of the investor deck has all the updated GRC information.
Turning to Page 4.
First quarter EMG results were consistent with our full-year outlook.
Core earnings declined $0.27 per share.
There were 4 major factors at play here: First as expected EMG experienced lower realized energy prices largely due to expiration of hedged contracts at Midwest Gen and Homer City.
Emerging coal fleet also had lower generation due to the outage at Homer City Units 1 and 2 as we discussed on our year-end call and the shutdown at Will County Units 1 and 2 pursuant to EMG's agreement with Illinois EPA.
EMG also received project distributions during the first quarter of last year from Doga -- March Point that did not recur this quarter.
Lastly trading income was lower.
We did see improvement from renewable portfolio increasing $0.03 per share overall.
EMG's coal fleet operating performance excluding Homer City outage was generally comparable year-over-year.
We've included our normal summary of operating statistics and average realized prices on Pages 40 and 41 in the presentation.
Regarding Homer City repairs to Unit 1 were completed and unit returned to service on April 5.
We expect Unit 2 to return to service later this quarter.
Although generation from Homer City was down a terawatt hour the results were consistent with our 2011 earnings guidance assumptions.
Turning to Page 5.
EMG added modestly to its coal fleet hedged position.
We continue to believe that we can add value to the enterprise by being less hedged compared to our normal strategy of hedging 50% of the gross margin at risk for the comp year and lesser percentages in the out years.
Midwest Generation added 2 terawatt hours of hedges in 2012 and 1 terawatt hour in 2013.
At Homer City we made very minor changes in coal and energy positions compared to last quarter.
Page 6 shows the continued progress of EMG's renewable energy portfolio which Ted has already commented on.
One area that EMG continues to work on is wind financing opportunities.
Most recently EMG refinanced its Viento project financing and increased the overall financing by $85 million and netted $77 million of incremental cash after transaction costs.
EMG is continuing to look for opportunities to project finance the 920 megawatts of unlevered projects and for third-party capital to continue development of new projects.
As the chart on Page 7 shows wind sources of cash exceed uses primarily from the expected receipt of Treasury cash grants from projects completed during the first quarter of 2011.
Overall wind capital expenditures are coming in at or below planned costs.
Page 8 shows EMG's updated capital spending forecast.
The primary change from year-end numbers is that we lowered our NOx compliance capital costs by $25 million.
For SO2 compliance we have not changed our overall estimate of up to $1.2 billion in capital costs if the entire Midwest Gen fleet were to be retrofitted.
We did however shift some 2011 expenditures into '12 and '13 while some expenditures for particulate upgrades were shifted forward into 2013 from later periods.
Once the final HAPs MACT rule is released we will update our compliance capital costs estimate.
Meanwhile EMG continues to look for opportunities to optimize schedule and reduce capital costs.
Although EMG's capital forecast does not reflect it EMG is continuing to develop work on a 479 million -- 479-megawatt natural gas-fired project.
Let's refer to it as Walnut Creek.
We estimate the project's cost between $500 million and $600 million and it has a 10-year contract with Southern California Edison.
There are a number of critical development milestones still needed to be accomplished the project could plausibly commence construction before July 1 of this year.
EMG is also actively pursuing a project financing for Walnut Creek.
This project has been stalled for some time pending a resolution of the priority reserve issue which relates to the requirement of project's own emission credits as a condition of obtaining a construction permit from local air quality authorities.
EMG continues to exclude from its capital forecasts any environmental retrofit capital spending for Homer City to meet the expected Clean Air Transport Rule requirements.
EMG is discussing with the principal owner the appropriate environmental equipment and how such equipment will be financed.
Page 9 provides key financial covenant ratios for EME Midwest Generation and Homer City.
The unplanned outages of Homer City Units 1 and 2 and the continuation of lower power prices have impacted Homer City's liquidity.
In order to have sufficient working capital available for operating expenses and to pay the equity portion of Homer City's rent payment that was due on April 1 to the owner lessors Homer City took a number of actions including drawing $12 million from an equity reserve account accelerating payments on EMMT for future energy deliveries and adjusting payments of operating expenses.
These actions were discussed in more detail in our 10-Q.
To further enhance Homer City's liquidity effective April 1 EMMT assigned to Homer City a benefit of an arrangement that allows EMMT to deliver power to the New York ISO from Homer City.
These revenues were recorded as part of the Homer City revenues in lieu of prior classification as EMMT trading revenues.
EMMT trading revenues of $28 million -- excuse me EMMT realized trading revenues of $28 million under this arrangement in 2010.
I'll finish up with a few comments on 2011 earnings guidance.
Please turn to Page 10.
As Ted mentioned we have reaffirmed our 2011 core earnings guidance of $2.60 to $2.90 per share.
We have updated our GAAP guidance to reflect $0.01 of EMG first quarter non-core items.
This guidance reflects our principal operating assumptions including updated EMG forward hedged positions and prices as of March 31.
We also reaffirmed EMG's adjusted EBITDA guidance of $465 million.
We have lowered our guidance for EMMT trading revenues by $25 million this year.
This reflects the assignment of revenues I just discussed.
This does not impact expected EMG results as the offset will be recorded in additional Homer City revenues.
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Paul Patterson Glenrock Associates.
Just a few quick ones.
With the cooling water issue that you guys mentioned on Page 33 of the 10-Q could you just give a little more feeling for what the Midwest Gen exposure might be? What I'll do I'll turn that over to Pedro Pizarro.
Our initial analysis indicates that the proposed rules themselves should not have a material impact on the Midwest Gen coal fleet.
And by the way Homer City already has cooling towers.
EPA have stated that it expects what are called modified traveling screens to meet impingement rules for holding and releasing fish that are impinged by intake structures.
So we're updating our cost estimates for these modifications but they are not material.
We also have something called entrainment standards and those could require cooling towers.
But with those the agency has proposed some site-specific flexibility and factors to consider that we think indicate that units like ours should not be required to install cooling towers and the factors we're considering include things such as particulate emissions from cooling towers availability of land to build towers cost-benefit impact on overall water body and projected useful life of a plant.
So however Illinois is evaluating some more stringent water quality rules related to thermal discharge limit that could impact some operations.
Okay.
And then on another topic the Wind portfolio.
Another company has increased its life expectancy associated with what it sees for its wind turbines.
And I was wondering if you could tell us a what the expected life for the newer turbines that you've been procuring is and whether or not you see any potential change in the life expectancy of wind turbines? I'll have Maria Rigatti the CFO of Edison Mission answer that.
We don't expect to increase the depreciable life of our unit at this time.
We use a 20-year depreciable life and thus far we think that that's the appropriate time frame.
Next Hugh Wynne Sanford Bernstein.
Inc.</strong> Just a quick question on your SCE rate base forecast.
The forecast that you presented in the fourth quarter and I guess repeated in the first quarter incorporates the extension of the bonus depreciation.
It's somewhat higher the range you've provide is somewhat higher than the old forecast that you presented in the third quarter.
I just wondered why that was.
It really goes back to what we said in the year-end call.
There were a number of things that occurred as part of the update process.
There were dollars that were shifted.
We actually dropped out some expenditures associated with the Solar Rooftop Program and there were some timing-related issues shifted from one year to the next.
And I'll stop and ask Linda Sullivan if there's any more there that we should comment on.
Yes Hugh what we did was we trued it up to our General Rate Case filing.
We adjusted it downward for the Solar Rooftop filing as well as the bonus depreciation.
Inc.</strong> So what drove it up? The true-up to the CPUC General Rate Case filing as well as moving the timing of some issues around.
Inc.</strong> What do you mean by true up? We ended up putting into our rate case filing -- our ratio to rate base is what we've included in our rate base filing so that's the full request.
Inc.</strong> So basically you've added some projects.
You've shifted some projects in time.
And you brought up the bonus depreciation.
Right.
Inc.</strong> A quick one on Homer City.
I mean you said that you're still trying to figure out how to finance the necessary SO2 scrubber installation I guess at Units 1 and 2.
Pretty much running out of time to get those scrubbers online by 2014 when the Clean Air Transport Rule will come into effect.
What are the implications for the availability of that plant in the 2014 2015 capacity market? Well we will actively participate in the auction.
As you know it's coming up soon.
And related to that question is that there's ongoing and active discussion with the owner lessors on what equipment we're going to utilize and how we're going to finance that.
We understand the time frame is relatively short.
So we're thinking hard about that and doing preliminary engineering work as you would expect so we can move along as quickly as we can.
Inc.</strong> So the strategy in other words for you to have the plants scrubbed by the time the summer of '14 rolls around? Yes exactly.
Next question Ali Agha SunTrust.
Inc.</strong> Could you give us a sense of what reaction or feedback you've gotten from the regulators now that the 32% renewable mandate has been approved? Any implication at how they're looking at the utilities and general cost of capital the risk profile? Any sense of how they're viewing that especially as cost of capital discussions start to come up next year for you and others? Ali this is Jim Scilacci.
I'll start and hand it over to Ron Litzinger.
As you probably know our cost of capital is going to be in place through the end of next year.
And we have the triggering mechanism in place now and we don't anticipate that it would result in any changes.
Clearly that was something that we'll be focused on as we go into the first part of next year.
The procedural schedule would be that we would file for whatever we're going to do in May of next year.
And then we'd probably litigate it through the balance of the year with a decision probably in December before it would be reset.
So we haven't come in to any conclusion yet on what mechanism we would likely propose.
But as you would expect and it's obvious with lower interest rates there may be some pressure on the return on common equity.
But the real important time frame will be in the fourth quarter of next year when they really get down to thinking about what the appropriate rate of return would be.
Ron would you add anything? Our discussions at the PUC with the commission we've been discussing at a very high level.
And this is while the legislation was still in place the potential upward pressure on rates and recognizing the impact that has with our need for reliability investments as well and generally at that high of a level in our discussions.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
Jim if I heard you correctly are you saying the low interest rate environment likely puts downward pressure on ROE; when you balance that against the need for more renewables et cetera are you budgeting assuming a lower ROE on a going forward basis? Did I hear that correctly? Yes I didn't say that.
What I said was that it was the current lower interest rate environment that potentially could some put some downward pressure on return expectations if you were to get a decision now.
But the critical time frame which I'm saying is going to be next year and especially in the fourth quarter of next year when the commissioners will be deliberating on the appropriate return on common equity.
Inc.</strong> Understood.
One question quick one.
As you look at your CapEx numbers as they start to get firmed up for the next 3 years would you just remind us again where you stand with regards to potential need for additional equity for EIX? Yes and a critical piece of that is what's going to happen in 2012 GRC because that will set the expectation of capital spending and the timing of the transmission expenditures which obviously flows through a lot of procedural steps and ultimately ending up at FERC.
And we have no plans for equity.
And as you know the bonus depreciation this year and next has the ability to enhance our cash flow such that we just don't have any plans currently for equity.
Next question Michael Lapides Goldman Sachs.
Ted your commentary at the beginning of the call on the RPS standard and I'm going to mess up the quote here but it almost made it sound like you view it as a challenging standard and an expensive standard for the state to meet.
In most states we've seen -- or in many states we've seen a movement to where the utility meaning in rate base is taking a little bit larger of a role in adding renewables.
It seems you're going the other direction.
I want to make sure we understand why and whether you think the RPS is achievable if SoCal Ed [Southern California Edison] is actually not a big builder of renewables and rate base? Yes the quote was challenging and comparatively expensive and I think that is how we view the 33% renewables.
There aren't other states that have gotten to this aspirational level.
I think the other element is a lot of things have to come together and work together in order to achieve the 33%.
I highlighted one of those policy responses which was the once-through cooling.
If we end up taking out a number of megawatts of gas fired generation it makes the integration of a much higher renewables level all the more difficult.
And that's the part that we really need to make sure that policymakers and the public fully understand is this is an integrated engineered system.
It's not simply a one-dimensional system and we need to be able to ensure the reliability of the grid.
And that's going to be a fairly complex undertaking.
That's the challenging part.
If you were taking out fossil-fired generation and replacing it with renewables generation at least the current technologies then that is more expensive.
So that's the comparatively expensive part.
The final point I guess I would make here is we see the transmission as being one of the key bottlenecks at this point to actually delivering the higher level of renewables to where the load is.
And since we believe we are uniquely positioned to design and build transmission and very importantly get it permitted so that you can build it that's really where our focus point is.
So there are plenty of people that can do the renewables development the actual generation projects and we feel that's a pretty robust competitive market.
That's how we really get the best prices for our customers is to have good solid competition and there are plenty of people who are interested in doing that.
It's the transmission that's the more cumbersome and difficult bottleneck and that's where we're uniquely positioned to add value.
Got it.
Jim one question.
I missed something the reason for leaving Walnut Creek out of the CapEx forecast? It's a good question.
That's why we highlighted it.
There are a number of critical development milestones that we need to get through and we're just not sure if we're going to be able to do all those things.
So we're flagging it as a potential.
And if we're going to do something it would be before July 1 because the rules the environmental rules change after July 1.
So we're flagging it and we'll let you know as we go down the path here what happens.
What does SCE do if Walnut Creek doesn't get built? That's a tough question.
They go through an annual review or they have a long-term procurement process they go through that they're in the process of right now.
And so they'll determine what their total need would be.
And it would come out of that process if there's additional requirement for new generation Michael.
Next question Steve Fleishman Bank of America.
A couple questions.
First when you guys are talking to public policymakers about 33% standard what kind of communication do you give them about how much rates could potentially go up to meet that? This is Ted.
It was part of the overall discussion in the legislative sessions.
This has been going on for 3 years or so.
And so I think it's understood that at least amongst the policymakers it's understood that there's going to be additional costs associated with this conversion.
The PUC a couple of years back commissioned a study that suggested to get to 33% was going to cost if I remember the number right around $112 billion which included both transmission and generation.
So I think it's understood that it's a comparatively I'll use the same phrase comparatively expensive proposition to get there.
Beyond that I don't think anyone has tried to specifically cover all of the elements in part because we're talking about something that's going to take us out to 2020.
So that hasn't really been baked into the rate cases that ultimately will be required to get us there.
But I think they generally know it's going to be comparatively expensive.
Okay.
One other question kind of switching topics on Edison Mission.
Ted you've said a number of times that you see the potential for equity value.
And I'm just wondering over the last few months I mean particularly the financing market has gotten continued to get better tax equity financing partnerships.
We saw Energy Future get an extension of their maturities.
Kind of what's your level of conviction today versus let's say 3 6 9 months ago on the potential to kind of get through the tough times? I'll just give a couple of general comments.
I think we looked at this very hard over many many months and looked as you know at all of the alternatives that we had for Edison Mission Group.
After that review we concluded that the best course of action for shareholder value was to continue to hold EMG and work the issues as aggressively as we can.
In this business of course so much rises and falls on what happens with commodity prices.
We believe it's still a cyclical commodity market and that we will experience some level of recovery but of course nobody can guarantee that element.
But there are a host of other issues that we can work and that we are continuing to work.
And so far I would say those issues have been moving in the right direction from our perspective.
And we've gotten a little improvement on commodity prices both on the coal and the power side which helped things at this point.
But again it's cyclical and those things go up and down.
So net-net I'd say we feel every bit as much conviction to continuing to work the issues as aggressively as we can focus on those things that we can control and try to manage this as effectively and as deftly as we can.
Next Jonathan Arnold Deutsche Bank.
Just one question I have was that are you still anticipating proceeds from insurance to cover some of the Homer City outage costs? And I think you've mentioned on the last quarter we didn't see anything in the Q and wondered if the timing is -- how that will sit with where you need to keep that credit metric and just maybe some context on that.
Yes on that I don't think that -- we are certainly focused on getting insurance recoveries.
We will have to discuss that with the insurers in terms of what qualifies and what doesn't.
But I don't think the dollar amount here is going to be sufficient enough to really change the metrics all that much.
Commodity prices as you know Jonathan swamp all this.
So that's the key.
Okay.
So it wouldn't be a big recovery in any event? It is not a big number.
Okay.
And then could I also ask on the coal transportation contract expiry in I guess for Midwest Gen does having the HAPs rule out and your comments around you're anticipating you'd be able to comply with it is that enough of a catalyst to sort of get to a point where we could see some movement? Clarification there or is that more likely later in the year? Yes I think it's more likely later in the year and we'll report it when we get through it.
And if I could just ask one on the utility.
I mean obviously they've had some changes at the commission.
And can you comment on whether you're having with new commissioners in place it sort of makes it any more or less likely you might be able to settle at least some of the issues in the case? And I know in the last case there was a push to move in that direction didn't really come about.
But how should we think around the possibilities there? I'll have Ron Litzinger address that.
Yes the commission is entirely in place now.
We have reached out and had initial conversations with all of the new commissioners including face-to-face meetings.
And we will continue to work with the commission on all of the tough issues we face like we always have.
Next Leslie Rich JPMorgan Asset Management.
Just a quick clarification on the EMMT trading margin.
What was your previous expectation for the 2011 trading margin out of EMMT? What we did in the guidance chart you can see we shifted $25 million out of each side of the range implying that it's gone over to the Homer City side and will appear through the books there.
So it used to be $75 million to $125 million and now it's $50 million to $100 million? Correct Leslie.
Okay.
And also I'm no bond analyst but on Page 9 it shows the debt covenant status for Homer City getting sort of close there.
Is that a function of the outages that were going on? Or do you foresee that there's some sort of covenant breach situation? Yes this was a tough issue during the quarter with the outages at Units 1 and 2 and with the lower prices.
It put some real stress on this metric.
And in my prepared remarks there was a number of things that we did in order to achieve the metric.
So we'll continue to watch that very carefully.
We have annual rent payments that occur there.
The next one is April 1 of 2012.
And what helps this metric the most is recovery of power prices in continued operation of the plants.
Okay.
So that's perhaps part of the reason why you shifted around the EMMT revenues? Exactly it was.
Next question Brian Chin Citigroup.
I noticed on Slide 8 for Midwest Gen you've got a little bit of changes on environmental expenditures.
You say that the HAPs MACT did not affect the overall estimates.
But the timing of Midwest Gen expenditures to meet compliance deadlines just shifted around.
So we see that some of the spending in '11 has been pushed out a little bit some of the spending after '13 apparently has been pulled up.
Can you just give a little bit more color on what's going on there? And what changed versus your expectations? The one thing we've mentioned specifically was the NOx expenditures dropped by $25 million.
The project came in under what we anticipated so we removed that from the capital forecast.
And we shifted some expenditures.
Now part of the strategy we've been working on is trying to optimize expenditures of coal and time frame.
And all these things we continue to move these things around to make sure that we can comply with the rate requirements but minimize costs to the extent possible.
And I did mention too that we shifted forward some particulate expenditures that were outside of 2013 into 2013 as we're looking at the rate levels and what was included in HAPs MACT it required some additional expenditures in '13.
So this is all live radio.
We're continuing to evaluate this.
And I think what's going to happen it's going to be at the end of the year when you get a final rule we'll re-evaluate the total figure again to see if it's appropriate given whatever ultimately is decided.
Next Jay Dobson Wunderlich Securities.
Jim I wanted to go back to the rail contract.
Could you just give us an idea on sort of where those negotiations stand and then maybe remind us what sort of competitive dynamic you have to exert between UP and Burlington Northern in the negotiations? That's a tough one to get into here on the phone or even in private.
Just assume that we're in discussions and we're trying to create as much leverage as we can.
And then we'll announce an ultimate contract later on in the year.
Sorry can't be more helpful.
Got you.
But I assume one option is to just simply go to an uncontracted status and just pay some market tests sort of how things go there.
Not that I know that's probably the one you'd like but that's an option.
Yes it would be a challenging one.
So we'll just have to see how it works its way through.
Okay perfect.
And then just separately but in the same region I was hoping you could give us a little idea of what you or maybe Pedro is seeing in sort of Midwest power prices? I appreciate your comments.
I mean they haven't changed and you've wanted to be more open as you look out into the '12 and '13 time frame for Midwest that haven't really changed very much to see the hedging status.
But just sort of what you're seeing and then with HAPs MACT already out there have you gotten sort of more confident in your fundamental view? And what's out there to support it? Yes there's not a lot to add here from a sense that we opened up our hedged position.
That has worked well to date which is good.
And we'll just see where the dynamics will go.
We've been anticipating all along that power prices would recover and it's always hard to predict the actual time frame.
And that's why we took the position we did to open our hedged position.
And I look over at Pedro to see do you have anything else to add? I guess the only thing I would add Jim is that energy price since we also watch what happens in the capacity market and we'll get more insight as we get through the upcoming 2014 '15 capacity option.
Got you.
Now that's fair.
But Pedro I mean what you're seeing in forwards is sort of consistent.
I mean they haven't moved around as much certainly it's not as much as you've seen in other markets around the country as far as the recovery goes.
And that's sort of consistent with your view of being more open? Yes I think we're all looking at the same forwards.
We continue as Jim said to look favorably on staying open.
As Ted mentioned we're seeing a little bit of recovery since the end of year.
But...
Next Ivana Ergovic Jefferies.
I was wondering if you could maybe tell us what is your experience whether you can sort of be able to use Trona [indiscernible] instead of scrubbers for compliance in Homer City.
Yes I think we've -- Ivana this is Jim Scilacci.
And we've done some testing of Trona at Homer City.
And frankly what we've found that it was not nearly as effective as we're seeing in Midwest Gen and probably the sulfur content has a lot to do with that.
And so there are some limited applications with Trona and potentially at Homer City but I think what we're going to do is ultimately the technology we're looking at for the 2 units at Homer would be to scrub those units.
Okay.
And are you going to include the [indiscernible] costs in your PJM RPM auction bids upcoming bids? Okay what I'll do here is just I think for right now what we'd like to say that we don't want to get into the public domain what our actual process is going to be around the bid.
It's obviously sensitive and we'll just defer that.
Okay.
And just another quick question.
Are your hedges mostly on peak or is it off peak? I don't know if you can comment on that.
All I'll say is we've added slightly to our hedged position in 2012 you can see the Midwest Gen.
What we would like to do when there are opportunities to hedge in the off-peak hours it's really to make sure in those shoulder months that we're not avoiding or avoiding operating at a negative margin.
So that's what when we'll pop in some off-peak hedges.
And we traditionally have hedged more on the on-peak hours just because that's where our gross margin is located.
So make grades and make some both right? And your hedges are more off peak? It is.
It's weighted towards the on-peak with selective hedging off-peak in the shoulder months.
Next Brian Taddeo of Gleacher &amp; Co.
A couple of -- First on Homer City.
I was wondering if you could comment with the switching or changing the contracts from EMMT to Homer City do you think that will keep you in compliance with the ratio throughout the rest of the year? Yes it's hard to answer that question.
Really what keeps us in compliance fully is the power prices.
And so -- and capacity prices for that matter.
And so it's one of the tools in our bag of tricks that we could utilize.
But ultimately we're going to need power prices to recover to more appropriate levels.
If you hadn't switched the contract over in the quarter would you have not been in compliance? I don't want to get into talking about what could or should have happened.
I'd just say that we did a number of things.
It's fully spelled out in our disclosures and we'll just have to see where it goes going forward.
Got you.
Also in Homer City it looks like you actually pulled some -- sorry you also mentioned where you pulled some of the payments forward from EMMT.
Now how much capacity do you have to do that? And is there still quite a bit of cash you can actually pull forward from them? Yes again I'm going to stick to our disclosures in terms of what we've said there and not get into discussion about capacity or what other options we might have.
So I'm limited to what I can say Brian.
Okay.
Then in one -- other one on tax bonus depreciation.
Do you have an updated view as -- will EME have to make any payments to SCE tax bonus depreciation over the next couple of years? No we haven't said publicly what the impact is in all years from bonus depreciation.
What we've said was that we'll likely be in a NOL position on a federal basis in 2011.
And it depends on what happens in 2012 if we will be there.
It's a possibility.
So I really can't answer your question at this point in time what might happen with EME.
Next question Ashar Khan of Visium Asset Management.
My questions have been answered.
Next Terran Miller Knight Capital.
Just a quick question Jim in terms of the insurance that you hoped for I’m talking about previously at Homer City do you think that would be sufficient to refinance or refund the equity reserve fund? Is it in that order of magnitude or do you think that has to be funded from other cash flows? Yes I don't want to get into the exact numbers here Terran.
We've said that the insurance is what I would consider not to be material.
Our next question is Jeff Kramer UBS.
[ph] Just a few follow-ups.
At Homer City just on Unit 2 bringing that back online is -- I guess is this longer than you expected? Is there anything causing that or any additional work you're doing there? What we're doing at Homer City we're continuing to work on the piping situation there that was troublesome for both units.
And I don't have a fixed date in terms of when we expect that will come back.
And we'll just -- when we finish all the work we'll ultimately get it back online and unfortunately I just can't give you a date.
Okay.
And then was it a contract that was assigned from EMMT to Homer City? And if so was it a Terra battery [ph] and was that affecting capacity payments available to Homer City? It does not affect capacity payments in any way.
It's just the transfer right that Homer City utilizes to send power to either PJM or the New York ISO.
Okay.
And just the Midwest Gen the accelerated CapEx in there was that largely due to need to add backhouses across [indiscernible] sooner than expected or were there certain plants that were added into the mix? You're really speaking out on the question.
I think you're asking about Midwest Gen.
Sorry yes.
Just the additional spend there that kind of accelerated was that specific to additional plants being included in the estimate? Or was that in regard you mentioned in particulate does that have to do with backhouses being included now in a sooner date? It really had to do with particulate removal.
So we haven't been specific what technology is shifting.
So we're just vaguely saying that it's particulate removal.
Okay.
Just lastly on Walnut Creek.
If that does move forward is $150 million the right ballpark for the equity contribution? I think just a rule of thumb we'll probably look for a project financing of about 75% of the project and then the balance then would be equity.
Our last question comes from Ray Leung of Goldman Sachs.
Just to follow on that last question first.
Just on the timing of equity would that be front-end loaded or back-end loaded? And then if you could talk about sort of your bank facilities and where do you stand with that any particular update there.
And what you're thinking about the 2013 maturity.
The equity would probably be front-end loaded.
Normally it would go in first and would draw on your project financing.
The bank line and the 13s are tied together.
And I don't really have anything to provide you an additional update.
We're working and focused on those.
We understand next year they're coming due.
And so we need to resolve the 2 issues together.
And we don't have an answer at this point in time.
The Q&amp;A portion of today's call has ended.
I will now turn the call back over to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone for participating today.
And please don't hesitate to call us if you have any follow-up questions.
Thank you.
Good morning.
My name is Candy and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Second Quarter 2011 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you Mr.
Cunningham.
You may begin your conference.
Thanks Candy and good morning everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's financial review together with the earnings press release and our 10-Q filings are available on our website at edisoninvestor.com.
This afternoon we'll be posting on the website our regular quarterly business update presentation that we use for our ongoing investor discussions.
During the call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
[Operator Instructions] With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thanks Scott and good morning everyone.
Today Edison International reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.54 per share compared with $1.05 per share last year.
Core earnings in the second quarter were also $0.54 per share and compared with $0.62 per share last year.
Core earnings in the first sixth months were $1.16 per share and compared to $1.44 per share for the same period last year.
Second quarter and year-to-date earnings performance is fully consistent with our 2000 earnings guidance.
In fact we now expect full-year earnings to be at the high-end of our earnings guidance range.
SCE continues to deliver solid earnings growth as it implements its capital investment program although second quarter comparisons were impacted by favorable tax items that occurred last year.
EMG reported a loss for the quarter which was expected but we are encouraged by the recent improvement in capacity and energy prices.
As always the third quarter will be a key determinant of full year performance and we expect to update our full year earnings guidance when we report third quarter results.
I'd like to spend most of my time this morning focusing on our key strategies and some important developments.
I'll start with SCE and its General Rate Case.
We are well into the rate case process now having completed several public participation hearings across the state responded to interveners with rebuttal testimony and commenced evidentiary hearings which will continue through the end of this month.
The formal schedule contemplates a decision by year end.
At a high level the issues raised by the interveners are similar to those from the 2009 General Rate Case.
They seek affordable electric service for customers.
So do we.
They want reliability and safety and so do we.
Above all else we hope that the process will appropriately balance these worthwhile objectives of safety reliability and affordability.
The cost of a public mandates is growing much faster than the demand for electricity driving up customer rates.
And therefore also need to be tempered by the need for this balance.
Moving to FERC on Tuesday SCE's 2011 transmission rate filing was accepted by FERC to be effective on January 1 2012.
This will include construction work in progress incentives that were previously recovered in separate proceedings.
The formula rate approach is more typically used by peer utilities in FERC ratemaking and this will best fit SCE's needs going forward.
We will be updating our revenue request to reflect the order's authorized base ROE of 9.93% plus a 50 basis point California ISO adder and roughly 40 basis points on the entire transmission rate base for ROE incentives previously granted by FERC for certain projects.
The overall ROE is expected to be about 10.85% in 2012.
The exact return will vary depending on the mix of construction spending and timing.
Progress also continues on securing approvals for some of SCE's major transmission projects.
In May we received approval from the Bureau of Land Management for the $411 million Eldorado-Ivanpah transmission project which will service new solar and wind projects.
Interior Secretary Salazar announced on July 14 approvals from the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S.
Forest Service for SCE's $655 million Devers-Colorado River Transmission Project which will access important solar resources.
In California much of the transmission rights of way cross federal lands so we were encouraged to receive approvals for these projects.
We in the industry continue to learn lessons from the events at the Fukushima Daiichi plant and from the initial NRC findings from its survey of site and system reliability.
We will continue to support the NRC's operational and safety reviews and determine at the appropriate time what if any changes in SCE's operations or required investment are needed.
We are also awaiting CPUC funding approval to commence the next round of seismic studies for San Onofre.
These studies will utilize the most advanced 3D survey technologies available and are expected to take several years to complete.
Wrapping up this discussion on SCE.
The focus of our capital investment is on enhancing reliability.
The focus of our efforts is on operational excellence and controlling cost.
In this way we expect to provide our customers with safe reliable and affordable electric service.
Now let me review for investors our strategy for EMG.
Having analyzed various alternatives for EMG we decided the best path was to continue to aggressively work the issues with operational focus and financial discipline to capture the option value for our shareholders that we believe exists in EMG.
Central to this strategy is maintaining EMG's separateness meaning no new capital coming in from Edison International and no distributions going out.
We also continue to diversify EMG's concentration in merchant coal-fired generation.
In this regard a particularly satisfying accomplishment is the completion of financing and commencement of construction on EMG's nearly 500-megawatt Walnut Creek gas-fired generation project in Southern California which is actually only about 15 minutes from our headquarters.
The estimated project cost is $575 million.
EMG won a 10-year contract with Southern California Edison in March 2008 one of 4 contracts awarded in a competitive solicitation.
Since that time EMG has worked hard to overcome a number of challenges to secure the necessary permits to build the project.
Earlier this year we identified an innovative approach to solving the permitting issue.
It involved the purchase and lease back of certain gas-fired generation assets owned by AES that will shut down before Walnut Creek starts operations in 2013.
Emission allowances for those assets will be transferred to the Walnut Creek project.
With California's prohibition of once-through cooling for gas-fired generation stations after 2020 instructing a project of this scale in an interim location near SCE's major load center will create both current and long-term value for EMG and an important source of safe reliable and affordable power for SCE's customers.
Additionally EMG's diversification strategy has made important progress on the wind development front.
EMG's 2 newest wind projects Community Wind North in Minnesota and Taloga in Oklahoma began commercial operation in May and July respectively.
And EMG placed its 29th project into construction in April the Pinnacle project in West Virginia.
EMG currently has almost 1 900 megawatts of wind generation in service or under construction in 11 states.
EMG also seeks to develop addition projects from its 3 900-megawatt wind development pipeline.
We continue to work on approaches to secure third-party capital to support the next phase of EMG's wind energy investments.
With respect to the coal fleet EMG has met and continues to remain committed to meeting all of its environmental obligations on time as spelled out in the 2006 Illinois Combined Pollutant Standard agreement and more recent U.S.
EPA regulations.
We believe that the efforts to identify cost-effective compliance solutions and the financing strategies to support them will serve us well in the long run even though they present considerable challenges for us in the near term.
We previously stated the draft U.S.
EPA HAPs MACT rule is consistent with our 2006 CPS agreement with the Illinois EPA.
EMG believes that the U.S.
EPA's new cross-state air pollution rule will not result in material changes in Midwest Gen's compliance plans required to meet the Illinois CPS requirements including both allocated allowances and capital expenditures.
However Homer City will be negatively impacted during interim compliance in 2012 and 2013 with the Phase I of the cross-state air pollution rule.
This is because a low level of allowances has been granted under the rule to Homer City and to Pennsylvania generally in those 2 years and by limitations on the extent to which allowances can be obtained and surrendered.
Homer City is evaluating its options for complying with the interim rules in those 2 years.
Depending on how allowance and power prices unfold we may engage in operational changes and/or reduce dispatch to comply with the Phase I of the rule pending installation of retrofits to comply with Phase II in 2014.
Work has already been done and continues on designing SO2 and particulate emissions controls equipment for Units 1 and 2.
So that Homer City will be in a position to meet the Phase 2 January 2014 compliance deadline.
Preliminary estimated costs are $600 million to $700 million.
Homer City continues to discuss with the lessors the financing that will be needed for the emission control investments.
That completes the major topics I wanted to cover and now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thank you Ted and good morning everyone.
Let's start on Page 2 of the presentation.
That is already summarized consolidated results for the second quarter of 2011.
I'm going to provide a bit more detail.
During the second quarter 2010 there were 2 significant income tax items that affect quarterly and year-to-date comparisons.
First SCE EMG and EIX recorded non-core benefits of $0.43 per share related to the global tax settlement.
Secondly SCE recorded a $0.12 core benefit for a change of tax accounting method for asset removal.
During the second quarter of 2011 the holding company costs were $0.01 lower than last year this was also mostly due to income taxes.
Please turn to Page 3.
For the second quarter of 2011 SCE earned of $0.65 per share compared to $0.75 last year.
Excluding the $0.12 core tax benefit from last year earnings grew during the second quarter primarily from rate base growth.
In our disclosures there are specific numbers but there are multiple sources of higher revenues including the utilities' 2009 CPUC General Rate Case FERC increases primarily related to Tehachapi transmission project and the SONGS steam generator replacement and Edison SmartConnect projects that are outside the customary GRC process.
On an earnings basis higher authorized revenues are largely offset by increased O&amp;M depreciation interest and taxes.
The net impact of these items was a $0.02 favorable earnings increase for the second quarter excluding the impact of the tax changes I discussed earlier.
That has covered the major developments in the quarter but I want to touch on SCE's capital spending.
Capital expenditures totaled $1.6 billion in the first half of the year consistent with our full year estimate of $3.9 billion to $4.4 billion.
In addition the utilities' 4-year capital spending forecast remains at $15.6 billion to $17.5 billion.
The utilities' July 5 rate case rebuttal testimony continues to support capital spending on needed infrastructure and our forecasted rate base.
The detailed forecasts are included in the presentation appendix.
With respect to the FERC rate decision that Ted mentioned this covers about 16% or just over $3 billion of our estimated $20-plus billion total rate base we forecast in 2012.
Turning to Page 4 you can see the second quarter of 2011 EMG lost $0.09 per share $0.01 better than last year.
The merchant coal fleet's results were behind last year primarily from lower realized energy prices and higher operating expenses.
As we mentioned during the first quarter call Homer City Unit 1 and 2 had extended outages to repair faulty piping.
Unit 1 returned to service in early April and Unit 2 in late May.
This obviously affected generation and forced outage metrics.
Midwest Generation's operating performance metrics which are provided in the appendix were very good for the second quarter of 2011.
EMMT our proprietary trading business had a solid quarter.
The contribution from EMG's wind portfolio was higher due to the addition of new projects.
Net interest expense did increase from additional wind project financings and lower capitalized interest.
The major difference at EMG during the quarter was Doga EMG's jointly owned gas-fired project in Turkey.
Doga contributed $0.05 per share during the second quarter of 2011 while in 2010 EMG received $0.03 per share distribution in the first quarter.
Typically EMG receives one distribution from this project annually.
Pages 5 through 7 summarize our year-to-date results which are in line with our full year earnings guidance.
I do want to note a couple of things starting on Page 6.
SCE core earnings totaled $1.33 per share through June 30 2011 which is $0.05 behind last year.
Excluding the $0.12 core tax benefit in 2010 earnings were up $0.07 consistent with rate base growth from infrastructure investments.
On Page 7 EMG's year-to-date losses largely reflect the merchant coal fleet's lower volumes including a Homer City outage as well as our lower average realized prices and higher plant maintenance expenses.
Consistent with our expectations the underlying performance of the renewable energy portfolio was strong with adjusted operating income increasing to $45 million in the first half of 2011 from $29 million last year reflecting the addition of 500 megawatts of new projects placed in commercial operation.
Availability also improved to 93.7% and capacity factors improved to 39.5%.
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes production tax credits.
Turning now to page 8.
EMG sold over 6 300 megawatts of coal fleet capacity into the most recent PJM RPM auction for the June 2014 through May 2015 period.
The modest decline that occurred at Homer City is due to the slightly higher forced outage rates.
We are encouraged to see the capacity prices for Midwest Generation which improved from $28 per megawatt day to $126.
The outcome of the recent RPM auction is consistent with our long-held view that as more coal shuts down capacity values will respond accordingly.
Turning to Page 9.
We provide updated information on EMG's merchant coal-hedge position.
Last quarter we purposely reduced our hedge position believing there was more upside to be gained.
Thus far we have benefited from this decision.
We still hold the view that it is better to be less hedged or below the 50% gross margin at risk level that we have previously shared with you.
Some of you will notice that we modified the chart to add the change in hedge position from the prior quarter.
For 2011 this is a combination of adding new hedges offset by hedges that were realized during the second quarter.
Note 1 is important to read to understand what happened during the quarter.
Hopefully this change is an improvement.
Let us know if it works for you.
As you can tell from the chart EMG did begin to layer in some new hedges in the second quarter to capture some higher power prices.
We added 2.7 terawatt hours for 2011 as well as 2.4 terawatt hours for 2012.
At June 30 we were hedged 8.9 terawatt hours for the remainder of 2011 and 9.1 terawatt hours for 2012.
In terms of coal hedging Midwest Generation added substantial commitments totaling 800 000 tons for 2011 3.9 million tons for 2012 9.8 million tons for 2013 and again $9.8 million tons for 2014.
Lastly in order to answer the obvious question negotiations with the railroads continue and we'll let you know when we have reached a final deal.
Turning to Page 10.
We have now expanded the wind development and financing charts to include the addition of Walnut Creek EMG's natural gas-fired project that Ted discussed.
This slide follows the same format we've been using for several quarters.
As of June 30 we had 185 for megawatts of wind generation under construction and remaining term commitments of 74 megawatts.
You'll see on Pages 11 and 12 the addition of Walnut Creek and the development program's sources and uses and capital expenditures.
On July 27 EMG closed the Walnut Creek project financing.
As Ted said we estimate Walnut Creek will cost $575 million to construct.
In addition financing costs and interest during construction are expected to be $40 million.
EMG's equity contribution is $120 million.
The addition of the project financing is expected to fund the remaining capital expenditures for this project.
Lastly as we expect to receive $360 million of U.S.
Treasury grants in 2011 and 2012 from our wind projects.
On Page 12 is EMG's updated capital spending outlook.
As we have indicated previously we are in discussions with the lessors of Homer City plant about a technology selection a method of financing for the scrubbers for Units 1 and 2 and the facility's environmental compliance for 2012 and 2013.
The preliminary cost estimates for the scrubbers is approximately $600 million to $700 million.
The point that Ted and I have covered regarding EMG speak to the key elements of our strategy to realize EMG's option value as summarized on Page 13.
We continue to see the market giving no value on our stock price for EMG but we believe there is real option value being preserved for the actions we are taking and with the potential for realization of that market value if there's timely recovery of power prices.
I'll close with a brief comment on our 2011 earnings guidance.
Ted has already commented that our full year core earnings outlook would place EIX at the high-end of our $2.60 to $2.90 range.
We have noted on Slide 14 that our key assumptions had not changed other than to update for forward prices as of June 30 and exclude future discontinued operations and non-core items.
We expect to update our guidance when we report third quarter results.
That concludes my comments.
Operator let's move to Q&amp;A.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Arnold Deutsche Bank.
Question on Homer City.
I know that you mentioned that in '12 and '13 you might seek to comply with the Casper rule (sic) [CSAPR] by running the plant last I guess.
Just how will you kind of address the I guess the covenant issues that might come with that.
I guess you had a similar situation earlier this year with the outages.
Jonathan I'll start it off and I'll pass it over to Pedro and Maria.
Given right now we're trying to work through how exactly we're going to operate in 2012 and 2013 and we're trying to work up a plan and with a plan then you can go through and determine what the financial ramifications would be of that plan.
And at this point in time I don't think we have clearly in mind how we are going to operate Homer City given the new rules.
We have to determine what the emissions credits might cost how many we could actually achieve and what the approach we're going to use in terms of how we might modify the operational plans.
So I'm going to stop there and look over to Pedro and Maria and see if you have anything else to add.
I think it's just early in the process for us to really give you a good sense for what we're going to do.
Jim I'd agree and Jonathan the one comment I would make is that we're not only looking at reducing the level of dispatch but we're looking really at all operational options and any other things that we can do to improve the chances the ability to comply under CSAPR.
So really looking at a whole universe of things and once we have that plan in place we can work through the implications on the financial side.
One last thing I'll add to -- part of the discussions with the lessors would be exactly what things we need to do in order to operate efficiently for '12 and '13 and then looking forward to '14 as we go into operations with the new scrubbers.
Okay understood.
Could you maybe clarify a little bit what is the --  you obviously sold forward in the capacity auctions for those periods what are you actually required to deliver in terms of performing under those short capacity positions? Again that's -- you can see the numbers in the disclosures as far as what we've actually sold and there are requirements under the agreement with PJM so I guess where you're going if you fail to deliver there are penalties but you also have the ability periodically in the auctions to adjust your positions either up or down depending upon your needs.
But you wouldn't have to be available 24/7 effectively.
Is there --  can you just remind us what the commitment is? I'll look over to Pedro.
Again when we sell into the PJM auctions there's a requirement to make the capacity available.
The point Jim was making was that commitment can be adjusted through the residual auctions that are held.
And then PJM also has in the worst case if capacity that is committed doesn't show up when it is called on there are penalty provisions called for in the PJM agreement.
So there are basically multiple stages to this first residual auctions and being able to true up positions and then through capacity non-materialized then having the exposure to PJM penalty provisions.
Can I just have one thing on the utility? Eldorado-Ivanpah it looked like the investment opportunity there went down $70-odd million between the last disclosure.
Was something changed with the scope of the project? When the PUC approves those Jonathan this is Ron at that stage they often will reduce your contingency pending final engineering and then you are allowed to update your costs at a later date when final engineering is complete.
So that's what -- this is just the contingency thing.
That's correct.
Next question Dan Eggers Crédit Suisse.
Just on the utility side.
Ted I thought it was interesting your comment about policy outpacing other issues as far as demands on customer bills.
Is there an appetite for change in California in any of these rules or is it the inevitable -- the nature of California at this point? I don't think anything is inevitable.
I think the key here and we're becoming more active in this is to explain to policymakers and to the public that the effect of such a dramatic increase in policy -- public-policy mandates ends up driving up costs and if electricity demand isn't keeping pace with those costs the natural outcome is higher customer rates.
So it's a pretty simple equation but you kind of have to put all the pieces together in order to see it clearly.
So this is what we've been talking to the commission about it's what we've been taking to public policymakers elected officials and the public.
Okay.
And I guess just on the generation side for compliance of the EPA rules.
When do you guys think you're going to have a more complete plan kind of on what strategies you're going to deploy to share with us and then what's going to be the decision to your right now on Homer City as far as getting the money together or the decision to get the money together to put the scrubbers on? I think the answer for both is probably around the same time.
We've said previously that we would look to update on our environmental compliance costs at the end of the year once we have a final HAPs MACT rule.
And that timing is coincident with our expectation for Homer City too.
It's key that we work through our issues with the lessors and think about getting into construction at Homer City by the early part of next year.
So it would take us 2 years to construct the facilities that we'd be online in early 2014.
So the general view Dan is we should be in the fourth quarter results we'll be updating for all the current events.
Okay so the scrubbers will only take 2 years to build.
So you guys will realistically meet the '14 time line even if the decision is not done until the first quarter? Yes and that's what we've said in the disclosures.
That's why we're doing some preliminary engineering right now in order to be in the position that we can --  if we reach agreement with the lessors and arrange for financing then we'll be right into construction in early in 2012.
The next question Travis Miller Morningstar.
Another question on the generation side.
If you guys maintain the no capital in no capital out there at EMG and you decide to go with the environmental controls on Homer City the $600 million or $700 million.
How does that affect your wind portfolio growth opportunities and any other kind of generation opportunities at EMG? Really what we're looking to do is we're looking to the lessor and potential third-party investors to finance the Homer City environmental upgrades [Audio Gap] we'll stop.
On the renewable generation portfolio part of Ted's comments and what we stated previously that we have about 74 megawatts of remaining commitments for wind turbines and we are seeking third-party potential investments equity to go beyond our existing commitments for wind turbines.
So that's 2 separate financings we're looking at in order to continue our wind business and make the environmental upgrades for Homer.
Okay.
And then a quick follow-up on that.
Does the -- I guess describe here the obligations and rights for that lessee-lessor relationship.
Do the lessors have the obligation and the right to decide essentially whether to retrofit and/or close the facility? I think the easiest way -- it's very very complicated.
There are extensive agreements covering -- governing the rights under Homer City and how we operate and our relationship with the lessors.
I think the simplest thing I can convey to you is that it's complicated and we're just working for a consensual arrangement with the lessors in terms of how we're going to make these upgrades and how we're going to operate post-upgrades in 2014 and beyond.
I think it's also important to note and we've stressed it before Homer City is nonrecourse within the EMG complex.
So just to summarize the lessor has the -- the lessor would be on the hook for the capital or is there a chance that you guys also would be on the hook for the capital? Again I'd say it's nonrecourse.
So if we don't have the capital resources to do it then we would not go forward with it on our nickel.
The lessor has a choice to make as to what they would do and as we've said we're really working on this as we're working with the lessors to find third-party financing for the retrofits.
Next question Steven Fleishman Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
You just answered one of my questions but just Jim on the comment that you're tracking toward the high-end of your range for the year could you just clarify what exactly is driving you to the higher end of the range? Is it better performance at EMG? Is it both? I think it's a little bit of everything.
I'm not going to be specific as far as tic and tac where it might show up but we are seeing higher prices and we've upped our hedging at EMG you can see that from the numbers we provided.
The holding company is tracking a little ahead year-to-date.
SCE is tracking a little bit.
So it's here and there and everywhere and we'll update when we get to the third quarter.
Okay.
And then I guess just on the transmission decision to that ROE affects the whole transmission rate base? We just recently had that court decision.
Let me just clarify it here.
The return on common equity that Ted talked about in his script it really affects things going forward in 2012 and beyond.
It doesn't affect what we're doing for 2011.
We just need to separate the 2.
And it's a slight reduction we're at 11.5% we expect for 2012.
And we're 10.85% based on the current numbers and the current mix of transmission spending for 2012.
Next Ali Agha SunTrust.
Inc.</strong> I wanted to clarify Jim comments -- I've heard a number of time you guys talk about preserving the option value at EMG and the actions being taken.
Just to take that a little step further what kind of time frame did you have in mind to preserve that option value? Is that an indefinite sort of plan? Or when do you reach a decision point that suggest to you perhaps the option value is not going to be recognized in the timeframe you have in mind.
What kind of timeframe are you looking at? Ali this is Ted.
I'm not the most patient person but I think generally speaking so long as we see and believe that there is option value we'll continue to work aggressively for that.
Clearly we'd like to see it develop sooner than later.
We'd like to see it reflected in the stock price sooner than later.
And I think that's mostly about picking off the uncertainties and being able to show investors more clearly where that equity value is that we see.
So that's what all of the efforts are focused on trying to accelerate the clarity and make that visible to investors.
Inc.</strong> So I mean end of 2012 -- if we're having that conversation Ted.
I mean is that a fair time to be thinking about this or it could be even longer? I appreciate your interest in trying to pin me down to a specific time but I really can't do that.
I think again it would come back to so long as we believe that there is option value there we see how we can obtain it then we'll continue to work hard to bring it forward.
We don't have a specific timeframe in mind.
Inc.</strong> Second question if I could.
You've talked about potentially bringing in some third-party investors in the wind portfolio.
You talk about third-party financing for the Homer City upgrade.
I'm assuming that's different from an equity infusion but correct me if I'm wrong.
But when you look at the Midwest Gen and Homer City portfolio as well would you have an interest even in this environment to perhaps bring in third-party equity ownership there to bring up some of that value? Is that a viable strategy in this market? I think it's probably wisest for us to not try to speculate a lot on those pieces.
I think we've tried to steer the path that we can in this discussion this morning.
The Homer City piece is nonrecourse.
We are seeking third-party financing.
That's critical.
That could either come from the lessors or it could come from third parties.
And I think we've got a good constructive effort under way with the lessors to find the third-party financing.
So that's the primary focus.
In terms of asset sales which is the way I interpret your question we have a policy of not really talking about those things unless we have something specific to announce.
Next Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein.
Inc.</strong> I had a question regarding Midwest Generation.
You pointed out that you believe you can comply with the cross-data air pollution rule based on the plans you're already putting in place to comply with the Illinois EPA agreement.
And you've given us the cost the capital cost of doing so.
What would be the impact on operating cost of the dry absorbent injection technology? Hugh it's Jim.
I think you're just at a timeframe where when we look to actually start spending on DSI or our trona approach it's really beyond the horizon for where we're going to give guidance.
Clearly there it would add to operating costs.
There are ways you can estimate it but we haven't been public as of yet in terms of how much of that might be.
Inc.</strong> Could you tell us what percentage of hours that operating cost might be recoverable or reflected in the price of power and therefore recoverable as opposed to when it might not? That's a tough question because it's going to be unit by unit.
And it depends on the timeframe from which we're actually going to install the DSI on the various units.
So obviously if we were to upgrade Waukegan 7 and that would be one of the first we're looking at moving ahead the Powerton Station.
And then it would depend on how often coal is on the margin relative to natural gas.
Those are really a whole bunch of complex numbers that I can't even begin to estimate here.
But there's obviously -- we're going to have to work through that as we get through -- go forward in time and we're going to have to come up with earning guidance as we get to that point in time but that's a couple of years out as you know.
Next Michael Lapides Goldman Sachs.
Can we come back to the transmission item for a second.
I want to make sure I follow this.
Can you update us on what the transmission rate base was that was part of the case? And am I thinking about it correctly that the rate base prior to the case continues to earn the prior 11%-plus ROE and anything after the case including some of the projects like Tehachapi are in the 10.85% ROE? I'm going to let our transmission expert Jim Scilacci give you the answer on that Mike.
And I'm going to turn it over to Linda Sullivan if I screw it up.
So the way we're putting it right now for 2011 and for guidance purposes we're using the simplified approach and using our total rate base x 11.5% x the 48%.
So we're not moving off of that.
So that's what -- for directional purposes that's what you should be using Michael.
It gets more complicated and we haven't given -- we haven't broken out FERC transmission pieces for 2011 so we're going to lead it with a simplified approach.
For 2012 and I said in my script our transmission rate base is about $3 billion plus or minus.
And that is the piece that would have the lower expected return which we're estimating right now based on the mix to be about 10.85%.
On all of the transmission rate base for 2012? On all of the transmission.
Including incremental projects as well as the rate base that was in service through the end of '11? Yes.
Now it's going to get a lot more complicated because you're going to have different rates of return on different pieces of FERC rate base.
And we're going to try and simplify this and find some way and go forward on an aggregate basis instead of trying to find that this project has an X return and Y  project has a Z return.
So we're going to try to keep it on an aggregate basis but we'll have to figure out that out for the -- in the year as we give guidance for 2012 and beyond.
And the major projects listed on Page 28 the ROEs for the bulk of those especially the big ones like Tehachapi and Devers have already been set by the FERC so I could follow up with Scott on just making sure I'm modeling the right numbers there.
That's correct.
Next Brian Chin Citigroup.
Going back to your answer to Jon Arnold's question on Homer City and the residual auctions for RPM could you just talk a little bit about how mechanically would that work? Is it that you go into the residual auction and try to buy replacement capacity to reflect the 2 units at Homer City that may not be available the entire time for '12 and '13 is that how it would work? Yes that's exactly the case.
Now again we're not certain we have to do that.
We haven't gone through all the mechanics of how we might operate under the new rules but what you just suggested is the way that we'd go about it.
And we actually do that periodically to the extent that you may need to make fine-tuning adjustments and you'll see it periodically in our capacity charts.
There'll be slight additions or deletions depending upon how we think we're going to need to operate.
Right right.
And then historically when you've made those slight adjustments obviously the cash impact happens during the settlement period but then do you record the earnings impact when the auction -- residual auction happens or does it all just sort of happen during the settlement year? Frankly I don't know the answer to that question so I'm going to have to follow back with you on mechanically how that works.
You would think that we would record the revenues as earned.
And so if there's a change then we would reflect it that way but we will confirm back.
Michael Goldenberg Luminus Management.
I wanted to follow up on Homer City.
As far as 2012 you said that there's several options.
You can reduce production you can do other things -- throughout the year -- - because from what I understand the penalty won't be known until the end of the year.
How do you go through the year making those decisions without knowing what the end result is until the end of the year? Let me just go through the litany of what we might do so we're clear.
You could change your operations you could potentially change the way you operate the plant in terms of the fuel so you can have higher or lower quality sulfur content.
We have the ability to do that but we're going to look at that carefully and we haven't made any decisions.
Now how the penalties are determined I'm going to pause and look to Pedro here and see if you have anything -- if there's anything else here we should add.
I'd like to clarify are you thinking about penalties that we're discussing only in terms of capacity at PJM or you're thinking about EPA penalties for the...
EPA.
EPA.
Okay.
I think we are still working our way through the rule on how this will apply as we have disclosed the allocations that we were granted for Homer City for 2012 and 2013.
In the rule are just short of 26 000 tons for each of those years.
If you look at our historical for 2010 emissions that was more around 113 000 tons per year in that ballpark.
They are -- it's a very complex rule and it includes not only those allocations for plants but it also includes limits on how many allowances that are purchased in the market can be surrendered.
So there's a lot of unknown still to work through here in terms of how will other players respond in the market what number of allowances will be available for purchase in the market how does that compare with the state level variability limits and how many allowances can be surrendered.
So still working our way to putting all those pieces together.
But my question was assuming you don't -- for example switch coal is there a sort of seasonality of output that would be more efficient than something else that you have considered and maybe can explain to us? Well simple answer is yes if you can imagine there would be seasonality of output and that could drive value.
I should just stop there because we're still working our way through the math of what would optimum operations for Homer City look like in the face of limited allowances.
So I think you're getting to the nub of the math problem and conceptual issue that we're working our way through right now.
Michael you've got a good question there.
Clearly you're going to want to operate during the high-margin hours.
And then how you optimize the design of your operations around that is the key and that's the math we're going through right now to try to figure that out.
And on fuel do you both have rail and the additional storage because of a lower BTU to burn lowest sulfur coal or is there storage problems at the plant? At this point I'd rather just comment we're looking at all these options and not go into more detail because we're really working our way through the issues right now.
Next question Raymond Leung Goldman Sachs.
Couple of things just switching a little bit in gears.
Of the guidance that you provided on EMG how much of that is from trading operations? And what have you seen in that end? If you go back in the deck it shows the numbers that we had included in our guidance for EMMT.
I think the number -- I'll confirm.
And I think it's $70 million to $100 million $50 million to $100 million we adjust it.
We showed at the beginning of the year a little higher number then we shifted to Homer City-related numbers over to Homer City.
So we dropped it from $250 million to $100 million and year-to-date.
And that's on a pretax basis just so you're clear.
That is not  an after-tax number.
And we did show here in our disclosures where the trading business is coming out.
It had actually a pretty good second quarter.
Great.
Two other things.
You show about $360 million in Treasury grants.
I think in the footnote you indicated 2012 for that or are you expecting any of that in 2011 at all? Small pieces 2012 the majority of it comes in in 2011.
The footnote should be yes I think there's just a small piece that comes in...
Any issues with you think getting those proceeds on time? No we've been -- we've already received a number of them.
There's a technical hoop you have to jump through and once you do that it actually comes in fairly consistent.
Okay.
And then is there any bonus depreciation for you guys? And can you sort of outline -- I know the IRS may have to provide the taxable income to So Cal Ed and sort of maybe outline what potential timeline that could help you guys in terms of that point.
A guess? Now this is confusing because you got so many different entities that are at play here.
We've said that EIX is in an NOL position for 2010 and likely for 2011 and potentially for 2012 because you continue to have bonus depreciation in 2012.
And that's going to cause a challenge for EMG to monetize tax benefits during that period.
And so after you reach -- you go out of the NOL period EMG after the utility goes out of the NOL position then EMG then could monetize tax benefits.
And we said that could take several years.
So let me pause there and ask you if the question still is clear in terms of -- it's not clear right now in terms of where you want to go with it.
I guess what do you expect potentially down the road from bonus depreciation? Well if you expect it we're going to have it for next year for 2012 at 50%.
So EMG would be able to take advantage of that for projects in construction for that year.
Beyond 2012 given all that's going on in Washington I think I'd be hard-pressed to believe that they extend bonus depreciation for another year.
It's been a tremendous source of cash for the utility for the last several years but those are political judgments and we'll just have to see where things in Washington go.
And just last thing any more color -- I know you guys keep talking about renegotiating the bank lines and you've always said weeks.
Can you talk about maybe what potential hurdles there may be that sort of continue to sort of play -- as it sort of continues to play out? Our intent is to ultimately put in place a credit facility at EME in Midwest Gen.
We're still working through what the amount would be.
We would clearly look to reduce from the $1.1 billion we have now to something below that.
And we're just going to go through the process with the banks.
Obviously the extension of the revolver beyond 2013 is linked through our process for determining what we're going to do with that maturity in 2013 mid-part.
And so those are things we're working through together.
And so I don't have a time line and we're -- clearly we're focused on that and it links back to the auction value too and how we extend the running board to resolve the '13 maturity so we extend that option value out.
Do you think that's an '11 event or a '12 event? I won't speculate on when that's going to occur but clearly we're thinking about it real hard.
Next Jason Mendel  [ph] RBC.
Just a quick follow-up question again on the cross-data air pollution rules and the impact on Homer City you've given some pretty good details.
That's helpful.
But for Unit 3 in particular is there any reason to expect that that unit can't just run flat out without any curtailments? I think Unit 3 given that it's already scrubbed and has an SCR it would operate in a normal arrangement.
And then for unit --  so we're talking about curtailments for Units 1 and 2 and then in the event that financing is able to be raised for scrubbing -- so the $600 million to $700 million I presume we're talking about scrubbers and then what kind of timeframe for outages would you expect at those units during construction? We haven't said yet because obviously you're going to build the scrubber it's really a standalone unit and you would need to cut it in through some type of outage that you would normally take and plan for.
So that's something that's down the road it would be probably in the latter half of 2013 before the unit would go operational in '14.
So but we would plan accordingly for and schedule our overhauls to correspond with that.
Perfect.
and then if I could just follow up one last question back to tax sharing agreement.
Given that the -- that agreement has generated some pretty good cash for EME over the last few years and may not for the next few years you pointed out the difficulty in monetizing.
Is there anything being contemplated in terms of figuring out some way to monetize that either externally or internally to the total enterprise? Well I think it's too -- it's premature to talk about what we may do there.
We're looking at it and that's all wrapped up in discussions we'll have with our banks in terms of what we might do next.
Thank you.
That was the last question.
I will now turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone for joining us this morning and please do follow up with Investor Relations if you have any further questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That does conclude today's conference.
You may disconnect at this time.
Good morning my name is Ilan and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Third Quarter 2011 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you Mr.
Cunningham.
You may begin your conference.
Thanks Ilan and good morning everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments together with the earnings press release and our 10-Q filings are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
This afternoon we'll be posting on our website our quarterly business update presentation that will use these and other slides for ongoing investor discussions.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read those carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
[Operator Instructions] With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good morning everyone.
Today Edison International reported third quarter earnings of $1.31 per share.
Core earnings for the quarter were down $0.15 from a year ago due to lower earnings from EMG.
Earnings at Southern California Edison increased 16%.
Year-to-date earnings were $2.46 per share.
Core earnings were down $0.43 per share compared to a year ago again on lower EMG results.
SCE core earnings increased 5%.
While we work to uncover the option value for EMG we believe a good proxy for the investment thesis in our stock is core earnings at SCE net of corporate cost.
The third quarter financial results are consistent with the high end of our earnings guidance range for 2011 and have given us even greater confidence in an improved outlook across the company at SCE EMG and the parent.
Therefore we are raising our 2011 core earnings guidance to a range of $2.90 to $3 per share.
Jim will provide more information on our higher earnings outlook in his remarks.
I'd like to focus my comments today in 2 areas; reaffirming the growth opportunity for SCE and the path to unlocking the potential option value in EMG.
Southern California Edison continues to implement its capital investment program which is expected to result in 8% to 11% average annual rate-based growth through 2014.
This growth is largely driven by California policy mandates such as transmission investments needed to meet California's 33% renewable requirement.
SCE continues to work through permitting and scheduling critical path items for its major transmission projects.
SCE is seeing cost pressures associated with the Tehachapi transmission project regarding engineering design and scope changes environmental mitigation work and permitting delays.
Last month for example SCE filed with the CPUC to comply with FAA-requested project modifications such as marking transmission lines and lighting certain transmission structures as part of the Tehachapi project.
The PUC instructed SCE to defer construction on these structures which have recommended aviation safety improvements until after the PUC review was complete.
The Tehachapi project is experiencing some community opposition and an impacted city recently filed another request for rehearing on the segment passing through their community with the PUC.
These issues and delays provide evidence of why we say it takes 7 to 10 years to design site and build new large-scale transmission projects in California.
SCE will be working to minimize the overall impact of any cost increases on individual projects and on its overall capital spending program while still meeting the state's policy goals for renewable power and meeting commitments with renewable generators who have invested based on state policies.
In terms of SCE's other major capital spending programs the Edison Connect's SmartMeter program remains on plan for completion next year.
SCE is about 2/3 of the way through the installations over 3.2 of the 5 million meters in total.
Total project costs are unchanged at $1.6 billion of which $1.25 billion is capital.
SCE's 2012 General Rate Case is moving into its final stages.
Last major procedural filings were made last month and the record is now basically complete.
The assigned administrative law judge must now draft a proposed decision.
SCE and its testimony has continued to highlight the critical importance of prudent levels of reliability and public safety investments.
Importantly we will ultimately manage the business within the dollars authorized as we seek to balance these key policy and system reliability objectives with reasonable customer rates.
The current schedule envisions a final GRC decision this year.
To the extent a final decision is delayed the commission has already ruled that it will be retroactive to January 1 2012.
I'd now like to turn to discuss the efforts to realize option value at EMG.
For some time now we've stated that there are several potential scenarios that can produce real value at EMG.
The size of that potential value seems large enough to us to warrant pursuing.
And the structural separateness of EMG from the rest of EIX coupled with the fact that Edison International plans no new equity investment in EMG made pursuing the prize practical.
However we also recognize that there is not unlimited time to work the many scenarios.
We are approaching the time when scenarios will give way to decisions.
And we believe many of these will be made over the next 6 to 12 months.
The final U.S.
EPA HAPs MACT rule now scheduled to be issued in December is a key regulatory decision needing to confirm Midwest Generation's environmental compliance program for several air pollutants.
Once issued and analyzed this will allow EMG to start making investment decisions on individual plant retrofits.
Retrofit decisions will involve a number of considerations in addition to HAPs MACT such as market and regulatory conditions and other potential EPA pronouncements in the water and greenhouse gas areas.
As many of you know Homer City was the first to challenge EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or CSAPR.
There have been 45 petitions for review of the rule filed 16 of which request full or partial stays of the rule and all are now consolidated under EME Homer City versus EPA.
Homer City's concern centers on the interim Phase 1 period of 2012 and 2013 where it sees real harm in how emission allowances were reallocated.
While we can't handicap the legal outcome it is clear that the rule has generated lots of controversy.
Beyond the major EPA rule makings just discussed there are some other elements that will be critical to realizing potential value at EMG.
First we must satisfy ourselves there is sufficient energy margin EBITDA and liquidity over the next few critical years in the face of challenges such as reduced capacity revenues and expected cost increases.
An important milestone will be the prices realized in next May's PJM capacity auction for to the 2015-2016 planning year.
One would think that the shutdown decisions by other generators since the last auction should lead to a further improvement in capacity prices but this needs to be confirmed.
Capacity prices and PJM are a critical indicator of future value for our fleet.
An example of cost pressures will be a new rail contract for Midwest Generation which should be completed before year end.
Liquidity remains a major focus for EMG over the next few years.
Project divestitures remain an option if necessary to meet EMG's liquidity needs.
Second the ability to obtain third-party financing of the Homer City scrubber retrofits with no equity investments from Edison Mission Group needs to be determined.
Pending finalization of the financing program for retrofits Homer City continues to work on critical path items including permit applications with the State of Pennsylvania and final scrubber technology selection.
At the same time EMG continues to formulate how to optimize operations for Homer City's compliance with Phase 1 CSAPR rules and 2012 and 2013 taking into account PJM rules existing capacity sales and allowance price and availability.
The third element is to make the appropriate environmental retrofit decisions for Midwest Generation consistent with the parameters we've discussed for some time namely EMG will retrofit only where it can see sustainable value for making those investments.
EMG continues to fine tune the construction timeline such that it can meet all its emission reduction obligations and yet minimize major capital spending well into 2012 while complying with construction permits issued for Waukegan and Powerton units.
The fourth element is to establish a more sustainable capital structure for EMG with the appropriate credit metrics.
We see this requiring a meaningful reduction of about $1 billion of EMG's $3.7 billion in unsecured debt over the next few years.
We continue to pursue opportunities that provide for long-term growth at EMG including targeted actions to further our renewables development program.
Most recently we moved 2 wind projects from the development pipeline into construction in Nebraska the Broken Bow and Crofton Bluffs projects.
These total 120 megawatts and importantly utilize the last remaining inventory of wind turbines.
Both of these projects will be completed next year.
We now have 31 wind projects in service or under construction totaling almost 2 000 megawatts.
We also have a 3 800-megawatt wind development pipeline which we continue to manage as we look to transition our growth program to third-party wind equity financing.
The Wind portfolio represents a source of liquidity both in terms of additional project financing capacity and asset monetization.
The rundown I just gave you is why I say the next 6 to 12 months are likely to be definitive for EMG.
In this timeframe we want to be in a position to describe to investors the rationale for the critical decisions and the major assumptions being made about EMG so that the market has adequate information to evaluate the equity value of EMG to EIX.
Much has been accomplished particularly in those areas where we have some control of the outcome such as finding the lowest cost retrofit solutions and much more will continue to be done.
Continuing worldwide economic uncertainties and increasing supplies of cheap natural gas are prolonging the recovery in power prices one of the critical factors in EMG's option value.
EMG will have to find ways to counteract some of the commodity price pressure.
That completes the major topics I wanted to cover so now I'll turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thank you Ted and good morning everyone.
Page 2 of the presentation summarizes the quarterly earnings comparisons that Ted's already touched on.
You will note we did not have any non-core items in the quarter while last year we had net favorable non-core impacts from the global tax settlement that totaled $0.10 per share.
Edison International holding company costs returned to a more normal trend this quarter at $0.04 per share.
Last year we reported core earnings for the holding company of $0.01 per share due to consolidated income tax benefits related to state income taxes.
Turning to Page 3 SCE's second quarter core earnings increased to $1.25 per share up $0.17 from last year.
These results are consistent with the regulatory earnings model for SCE.
This model is based on authorized returns on investments and capital structures approved by the CPUC as well as FERC.
Higher earnings in the quarter were driven by rate-based growth and lower taxes.
Income taxes benefited earnings this quarter due to increase in property-related deductions and lower interest accruals on tax reserves.
Page 4 is the updated chart that depicts SCE's cost of capital mechanism.
As many of you are aware the trigger mechanism is tied to the Moody’s Baa utility bond index.
For the 12-month period ended September 30 the index fell within the deadband and therefore did not trigger a change in SCE's authorized return on common equity.
Therefore SCE's allowed return on common equity for CPUC jurisdictional rate base will remain at 11.5% throughout the end of 2012.
In April 2012 SCE will submit an application for its 2013 cost of capital.
This application will also address the utility's capital structure and embedded cost of debt and preferred stock.
In our 10-Q we've also updated the utility's 2012 General Rate Case to reflect the required updates for known changes from governmental actions escalation and the shift of refueling outages at San Onofre into 2012.
We also updated the outlook for the FERC return on common equity to 11.1% from the preliminary estimate of 10.85% we shared on our earnings call last quarter.
This increase reflects a more thorough review of the underlying mix of capital spending and timing of projects moving into rate base.
This is really an issue of mix which allowed returns to vary based on how capital is spent during the year on projects earning different incentives.
Turning to Page 5 EMG earned $0.10 per share on a core basis compared to $0.37 per share last year.
Merchant coal fleet results were impacted by lower capacity revenues and realized energy prices.
In addition total merchant coal generation was 10% lower than a year ago related to the retirements of Will County Units 1 and 2 at year-end 2010 as well as higher forced outage rate at Midwest Generation.
I will also note that Midwest Gen's comparisons were impacted by the $0.04 per share core earnings benefit from the sale of a Lehman Brothers bankruptcy claim in the third quarter of 2010 which did not recur this year.
Detailed operating metrics for the coal fleet are included in the presentation.
Earnings associated with EMG's renewable platform fell $0.03 from the lower capacity factors 24% in the third quarter versus 28% a year ago driven mainly by lower wind conditions.
Pretax trading income was $11 million in the quarter compared to $27 million a year ago or a $0.03 decline on an after-tax basis.
Reduction in trading revenue was from 2 factors: lower proprietary trading results and the transfer of revenue from EMMT to Homer City for energy sales to the New York ISO.
Beginning April 1 2011 these revenues are now included in Homer City's results.
Net interest for Q3 2012 was higher than last year from an increase in the total amount of project finance debt and a reduction in capitalized interest.
I do want to add a few comments on EME's cash position which increased to $1.235 billion or a $402 million increase over last quarter.
The bulk of the increase was from the net receipt of $253 million in U.S.
Treasury Grants from completed wind projects and $182 million of tax sharing payments.
Overall liquidity positions are summarized on Page 19 of the presentation.
As of September 30 EME had recorded $340 million of deferred tax benefits.
As many of you are aware EIX is in a net operating loss position for federal income tax purposes so EME is unable to monetize tax credits like PTCs or bonus or other depreciations for its wind investments.
EME will be able to monetize its accrued tax benefits once EIX returns to taxpaying status and after SCE has fully monetized its tax claims.
I won't go into the year-to-date results in the interest of time.
These results are summarized on Pages 6 through 8 of the presentation and they are consistent with our ongoing message that rate-based growth will increase SCE's earnings while lower gross margins for the merchant coal fleet will adversely impact EMG's earnings.
Turning now to Page 9.
Midwest Generation added very modestly to its hedge positions including 558-gigawatt hours in 2011 and 408-gigawatt hours in 2012.
We've also reflected the additional coal commitments made in July that we had discussed on our second quarter call.
Page 10 summarizes the status of the current renewable and gas-fired growth portfolio that Ted has already discussed.
All 3 wind projects under construction are expected to qualify for the 30% U.S.
Treasury Grants which remain available through the end of next year.
And we will determine based on liquidity needs at that time whether to apply for these grants or instead utilize PTCs.
We have just over 1 000 megawatts of wind projects that have not been financed.
We continue to seek new nonrecourse debt financings for our contracted projects.
As many of you are aware the project finance market has tightened with the ongoing European banking situation and we were exploring the private placement market as an alternative to the project finance market.
Page 11 provides sources and uses for our development projects.
You will notice that we simplified the chart and added additional information through 2013 which is when the last development project is completed.
EMG's updated capital spending outlook for 2013 is shown on Page 12.
Compared to last quarter's forecast there are a few changes including an increase in renewable energy spending to complete 2 new wind projects located in Nebraska and a decrease in spending on Walnut Creek gas-fired project.
The capital spending forecast continues to include modest expenditures for early-stage work on the Midwest Generation's program for SO2 emissions reductions through 2013 which initially focuses on Waukegan Unit 7 and the Powerton units.
Final decisions to install full environmental controls will likely be made next year.
I'll conclude with some more details on our increased 2011 earnings guidance.
Please turn to Page 13.
Our next -- our key assumptions for the year have not changed other than using forward prices as of September 30.
Our increased core earnings guidance does not include the potential of up to $0.05 per share of energy efficiency incentive earnings if a PUC decision is reached during the fourth quarter of this year.
Using the midpoint of our $2.95 per share core earnings guidance SCE's guidance has increased $0.07 primarily from lower net interest costs and taxes.
EME's guidance improved by $0.09 based largely on higher gross margins at our merchant coal fleet.
Loss at the holding company improved $0.04 due to lower income taxes.
Consistent with EMG's updated earnings guidance we are also increasing EMG's EBITDA guidance to $529 million from $465 million.
Page 39 provides supporting information.
Looking ahead to 2012 guidance we would not expect to provide new guidance until we receive a final SCE General Rate Case decision.
Lastly we tentatively plan to report fourth quarter results on February 29.
That includes my comments.
Operator let's move to Q&amp;A.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Ted I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate even more on the 6- to 12-month timeline when you're talking about mission.
Is that thought process this will come kind of piecemeal as far as decisions with a Homer decision and then a broader decision on the business? Or how should we think about kind of layering data points from here? I think what I was trying to do in the script is give you a sense of those kind of major events all of which seem to kind of line up over the next roughly speaking 6 to 12 months.
So for instance on the liquidity side we've got a revolver that's coming due and obviously we're getting closer to the 2013 maturity of the $500 million.
Secondly we've got Homer City decisions that need to be made in order to comply with the upcoming CSAPR rules particularly the retrofit decision there.
So we're actively out seeking third-party financing for those retrofits.
We've got important decisions on retrofits to make with Midwest Gen that are really pretty much in that same kind of general timeframe.
So again I won't repeat it all but just ticking through it I think you can see some of the major decisions are lining up such that we really need to make those decisions in the next 6 to 12 months.
I think that will pretty definitive as to what the overall earnings and liquidity picture looks like for EMG.
Research Division</strong> And Ted when you go through that process you guys have long talked about the option value of the business and the attractiveness because of the option without the downside with the ring fencing.
But with the 6- to 12-month process you involve the possibility that if there's not substantial equity value as you guys get through kind of these data points that the whole business could be reevaluated from an Edison International perspective? Well certainly.
I mean always that potential exists.
I think the main thing we're trying to signal here is a number of external factors will clarify over the next half a year to a year.
We'll end up making some important decisions as a result of that on retrofits and the like.
All of those things will I think provide us as well as investors of a lot better clarity on really how the option value looks for EMG.
I don't want to speculate too much beyond that but I think we'll have much greater clarity around what that picture looks like.
Our next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just a question.
Ted in your remarks you talked a little bit about some of the cost pressures related at Chino Hills and Tehachapi.
Can you talk about when you're likely to have an update on what the final cost estimate for Tehachapi would be and do you expect hitting regulatory push back in terms of being able to fully recover any incremental cost on the project? I think what I want to do is pass that over to Ron Litzinger to give you a little bit of an update on that.
We owe the California Public Utility Commission a revised estimate once our final engineering is complete.
We are working to get that complete and we'll likely provide that estimate probably early next year given some of the developed -- recent developments.
Research Division</strong> How did this impact -- like how do you guys think about what the worst case scenario is in terms of the timing for when the project goes in service? We're continuing construction on the segments that are not impacted by some other recent events.
We are trying to hold our construction schedule so that the deliverability of the renewable generators out there can be met and I believe the PUC is sensitive to those schedule requirements as well.
Our next question is from Steve Fleishman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> I guess 2 questions.
I'll be brief on those.
Just to follow up on the question on the EME analysis.
We'll get more data over time to know the value.
I guess is there a risk that the more that you know the value the more that you've actually lost option value.
Thereby waiting this long to get answers we're losing the people that might have been more optimistic to put option value on this? I don't know if that make sense but just...
Well I'm not sure exactly all the things that are in your mind on that Steve but yes I think...
Research Division</strong> Well it's just that someone who might have been more bullish in their views the more -- if the more we get data points they could be ones that are negative.
So I guess the real question is have you been evaluating the value of this yourselves and externally all along and by continuing this forward potentially losing value so to speak? Steve I'll put us both out of our misery here.
I think as difficult as your question is to phrase I have the same difficulty given the sensitivities answering it.
I think the fundamental point is that and we've said this to investors before going back -- well it's getting close to I guess we started the process a couple of years ago we analyzed what you would -- I think everyone would consider the basic generic options for EMG selling it some version of spinning it off restructuring and continuing as we termed it continuing to work the issues hold the assets and work the issues.
At that time we didn't see a heck of a lot of value in the first 3 options beyond what the tax shield is.
So that left us looking at the potential for realizing significant value by continuing to hold the assets and working through the issues.
It looked pretty asymmetric to us and I alluded to that in the script that we're -- we were -- we saw some pretty significant potential there a wide variation between the downside cases and the upside cases but the downside cases didn't really -- weren't really that relevant from the EIX perspective.
So that encouraged us to continue to hold the assets and work the issues.
If at the end of all of that to go to your point we don't see a lot of value or issues crop up that make some of those more downside cases the reality then I think it just puts us back to where we were at the beginning.
So I think from our perspective this was a prize worth working for and we still believe that there are some significant value in EMG.
It would be nice if we could get a little help on the commodity price side but that's one of the things that's out of our control.
By the same token there have been some things that have helped on the capacity value side.
So we're just going to continue to work through it.
I think things are going to clarify quite a bit more in the next half a year to a year.
And I think that's going to really be definitive for us and we'll be able to discuss that pretty openly with investors once we have that information.
Research Division</strong> That's helpful color.
You've actually answered the question even though I didn't ask it well.
Is there any settlement talks still going on? I'm sorry? Research Division</strong> Is there any settlement talks still going on on the GRC or are those over? I’m going to let Jim take this one.
Okay.
We won't comment on any discussions that may or may not be occurring with the Commission.
That's why I gave it to Jim.
And our next question is from Gregg Orrill from Barclays Capital.
Research Division</strong> I was wondering if you could talk about your flexibility to respond on the cost spending in the event that you would get what you believe is a negative outcome from the GRC.
This is Jim Scilacci.
I'll start it and pass it over to Ron or Linda for further clarification or enhancement.
Whatever the Commission decision ultimately provides the utility we will set our spending in both capital and O&amp;M to meet what the Commission has authorized.
That is just a basic fundamental view that we have.
So if they cut deeply in areas then we'll need to adjust our spending accordingly so we can have a reasonable opportunity to earn our authorized return on common equity.
Now we've done this historically.
We go back and many of us in the room have been through many GRCs and this is the normal reaction to any kind of decision you get.
You will adjust your spending and you will adjust what goes on in the organization to reflect that.
And I'll stop there and look over at Ron or Linda to see if they have anything else to add.
They're shaking their heads.
Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
When you -- you've talked about likely resolving a rail contract at Midwest Gen by year end.
Is it reasonable to expect that you would also be locking down some of the rail aspects of your trona compliance plan simultaneously? This is Jim.
I'll start and pass it over to Pedro.
Now you've got different timeframes here.
The usage of trona is a little further out in the planning horizon and when the rail contract expires for the commodity coal.
So it doesn't line up exactly so as you would expect that as we start using trona which is more in the 2013 timeframe we will look to block in the necessary transportation.
So that's more of a next year type of thing.
Pedro anything else to add? Jim that's right.
The only thing I would add is that we'd also expect to be looking at much smaller volumes for trona than we would for coal.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then I noticed on the slide where you talk about dividend policy you used to say modest annual increases and you've added this while SCE implements major CapEx program sort of second half statement and obviously your CapEx is forecast to peak in '12 and then step down quite materially.
Is that -- are you suggesting that you might be more open to something above a modest increase once we get through that CapEx peak? Jonathan that’s something we'll have to talk about with the Board but I think the modest annual increases is still our preferred course.
Because even though we're coming off a peak we've gone up very rapidly and we'll need to adjust accordingly.
Our goal ultimately because our payout is obviously going down.
And we'd like to adjust over some period of time back up to a more normal payout ratio somewhere between the 45% and 55% target payout ratio that we've talked to you about.
And maybe depending upon what happens with our GRC what happens with tax policy and whatnot but we will ultimately move to a higher growth rate.
But in the near future I think we're going to stay with the more modest increases.
And our next question is from Ali Agha from SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> In the slides as you all indicated with regards to SCE's cost of capital filing you filed that in April.
I guess if I recall from prior memory the process takes you through maybe September October.
I was just wondering once GRC is behind you is there a way for you to accelerate the decision making for the cost of capital and just have that issue resolved perhaps in the first half of next year? It's a possibility Ali.
But I think what's going to happen here if we were by ourselves if it was just Southern California Edison it might be feasible but we'd have to include the way it works here in California.
It's a joint proceeding with the Semper companies and PG&amp;E.
And so we'd have to all get together and decide if we wanted to do something.
And I think that's a possibility and I think the other utilities have liked the trigger mechanism that's been designed.
So we have to look to maybe potentially retain that structure.
But I would anticipate you should probably plan on a decision in late -- in the fourth quarter of 2012 realistically.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And second question going back to EMG as you look at your portfolio going forward and then you updated the pricing curves et cetera as well; I mean realistically given how you're seeing this market when would you expect EMG to return back to profitability overall? Is that 3 to 4 years down the road or do you think you can do it sooner than that? Well I think it's important to look at ultimately the EBITDA generation capability for the company.
And really from the capacity values and the forward curves we're going to struggle for the next couple of years.
It's just the math and you can do the mathematics on the open position and where prices are right now.
So beyond that as we flip to an assumption of rising capacity values and then tightening of the marketplace and we would come out of the trough and work our way ahead.
Now it's anyone's guess if that ultimately turns out the way the 4 curves and our view of capacity values actually go that direction.
We believe that's going to be case.
And then we'll get back to where we'd like to see the business.
But it's going to take a couple years.
Our next question is from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> I also had a question regarding the upcoming cost of capital proceeding.
You have a helpful chart here on Page 4 of the slide that shows the moving average of Moody’s Baa utility index remaining within the deadband implying no change in ROE in '12.
But similarly the index has now been for several months at or below the bottom of the deadband which might lead the Commission and the proceeding to think that a significant downward adjustment of the benchmark and the ROE would be appropriate.
I think also you recently disclosed that the ROE set by FERC in your transmission rate case had been reduced to something like 10.85 if I'm right.
So I just wanted to kind of get your sense of what are appropriate expectations for the outcome of the cost of capital proceeding.
Do you think the Commission will move directly to this -- to reflect these lower interest rates in ROEs or do you think they’ll take a longer-term view and allow you as you have in the past to continue to earn a relative robust allowed ROE? This is Jim.
I'll start out and leave it for Linda or Ron to fill in.
Just a point of clarification.
In my script we said 10.85 was the FERC return on common equity.
Initially we revised that to 11.1 and it really has to do with the mix of projects that have incentives within the rate base.
So as we build more to Tehachapi which has a higher level of incentives the weight -- the weighted average gets you closer to 11.1.
But you're correct the FERC did establish the base ROE and with incentives you're getting up to these higher levels.
So clearly they're reflecting the lower interest rate environment in the overall returns.
And potentially we’ll have to go through the discussions with the Commission.
Historically they've recognized with our large capital programs and the impact of debt equivalents on our balance sheet from all the PPAs we have entered into over the years and continuing to enter into there is impacts beyond what the metrics without the debt equivalent standalone would indicate.
And I don't have any great insight.
With low interest rates there will be obviously pressure on the return on common equity but ultimately it's going to be dependent upon where we are at the end of the year.
Our next which is from Jay Dobson from Wunderlich Securities.
Research Division</strong> You used the word "We" when you were discussing the efforts to raise external capital for Homer City.
And so I was wondering if you could just give us an update on sort of where that stands and sort of how you're feeling about those efforts as we close in towards year end.
Just to give you an overarching comment and then let Jim pick it up from there.
The “we” refers to obviously Homer City is going out and doing that but doing it in cooperation with the leasehold equity so primarily GE.
So there are regular conversations going on there and we're trying to really present a coordinated approach to the capital markets as we look at financing but Jim you want to provide anything more? Yes.
And we would -- we've engaged a financial advisor to help us in that process and we're in the midst of it.
And we don't have anything to add because we're right in the middle of it right now.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> Got you.
But that's something I assume you'd have by year end or sort of shortly thereafter.
And if that's true how would you expect to disseminate that? Well again our goal is to move as quickly as possible here because working backwards from the 2014 timeframe when we want to be able to comply with Phase 2 of CSAPR so you have to have the equipment installed the 2 FGDs early in 2014.
And just working back from the construction schedule that that would imply we're going to need to move this along quickly.
And in the second phase then look to finance the $300 million of additional leasehold bonds swaps to fully finance the scrubber construction and so all of this has got to be done on an accelerated basis.
So we're moving as quickly as possible.
And so Homer City is a separate registrant and if there's material news there we may have to do something separately for Homer City.
So I can't tell you exactly when all this is going to unfold.
Research Division</strong> Okay perfect.
And as a follow up to that but more broadly is Ted you indicated you're currently analyzing your operational considerations for Phase 1 under CSAPR for both I assume both Homer City and for the Midwest Gen.
Understanding that that's still work in progress.
Could you give us a sort of how you're feeling about that and what sort of the current work process might suggest as far as operations in '12 and '13 for those assets? Let me have Pedro Pizarro give you a little rundown on some of the considerations there.
Sure.
Well Midwest Gen as I think we've disclosed prior -- we don't see a major impact from the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule.
And we believe that the current plans for operations in Midwest Gen are compatible with that rule.
You saw on or you'll see in the disclosures from this morning there was a write-up there on the impacts at Homer City and for the Phase 1 the 2012-2013 period as you probably know the current rule leaves Homer City fairly short in terms of allowances and the allocation is round numbers around 26 000 tons of SO2 allowances compared to 113 000 tons of historical emissions in 2010.
And so Homer City right now is going through the process of -- a 2 tracks.
One is Homer City has made legal filings looking for a motion for a stay on the Phase 1 phase of the CSAPR Rule.
And then in addition to the extent that that rule is in place once January 1 2012 rolls in Homer City is looking at a number of options for how they would have to modify its operations or reach out to purchase allowances in the market.
A lot of variables are at play here that really won't become clear until January 1 2012 including what -- at what price are allowances available in the market and to what extent are they available where are power prices and what's the – how do power prices respond to those allowance -- SO2 allowance prices and then we'll be looking at options -- are looking at options on Homer City including are there differences in how the project gets dispatched or how it handles its fuel.
Research Division</strong> And that’s primarily units 1 and 2 right Pedro because 3 is scrubbed? Yes 1 and 2 since 3 is scrubbed.
Our next question is from Terran Miller from Cantor.
Jim I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you think the project finance capability is remaining of the wind portfolio.
Terran we've got over 1 000 megawatts that we have not financed.
Some of those are merchant projects so there's 240 megawatts for our Big Sky project.
Goat Mountain's 120 megawatts and there's another smaller project.
And potentially there you could finance that but traditionally that's been a tough thing to do without a PPA.
So that if you take those out the balance are obviously contracted and there are different stages in the first 10 years of their PTCs.
So there's some amount.
It will depend upon the robustness of the market.
I can't give you a number off the top of my head here if you were to ask me to give you one but there's potential.
And our job here is to look to see if we can finance the maximum extent possible or find PPAs for those merchant projects and then flip them into potential project financings.
So that's the order of march here.
And do you have any optionality to do anything on the tax equity side or because of the need up top it really doesn't pay for you? It is certainly an option and we're considering it for a group of projects right now.
But those tax equity we have not done one as of yet.
We’ve only utilized – since we’ve been untaxable historically utilized the BTC at EIX.
So we are looking at that now and we'll have to see how viable it is as we go down the road.
And Ted just a point of clarification.
I've listened to many of these conference calls; I didn't get a sense that your answer to either Dan Eggers' question or Steve's follow-up question was really anything different than the answer you've given in the past.
Did I miss anything? Nope.
Our next question is from Greg Gordon from ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> So would be the 315 midpoint earnings estimate for SCE just on its face appears to be an ROE modestly in excess of the 11.5.
But I do understand that that includes -- probably includes CWIP and that corporate allocations also move around.
So can you comment on what sort of all the moving pieces are that gets you to that number as your midpoint? Okay.
This is Jim Scilacci and I'll start there and hand it over to Linda if there's supplemental information.
Generally we target to earn our authorized return on common equity.
And there are things that can cause us to earn slightly above or slightly below.
If you look back historically we've come in at fairly narrow range.
And the things that we see that can affect the return on a positive side for the last couple of years than a couple of key areas in the primary one have been tax benefits.
We've been the beneficiary of a lot of cash that's deferred the need to finance as much as we originally forecasted.
So that comes with a cash you have lower borrowings you have lower interest expense so you have a benefit embedded cost of debt and preferred.
Those are the areas -- that's the principle areas that we have seen the -- that's given us the benefit that's caused the outperformance.
And there’s some areas we overspend but we put more O&amp;M into our San Onofre station over the last couple of years but net-net-net this is washed out and the tax benefits really stand alone as the thing that has driven it above.
I'll stop there and look at Linda anything else you'd like to add? It's the tax benefits as well as interest-related benefits from the capital spending -- the timing of our capital spending programs.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So your -- when you give the rate-based numbers in the appendix do those numbers include or exclude CWIP? What we do just for clarification we go back and give you a rate-based model.
And that includes just simply the -- our rate base x our authorized return on common equity x the 48% common equity ratio.
And what we've said that there are CWIP earnings but there are portions of our business that we don't get cost recovery for.
So if you make corporate contributions there are certain executive benefits our short-term incentive programs aren't fully funded.
So it tends -- we like to say that those benefits from CWIP are offset by those that we don't get cost recovery for.
So we'd just guide you back to the simple rate base methodology.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Great.
So CWIP offsets the nonrecoverables and you've been doing modestly better on the financing side because of the tax benefits.
You said it better than me.
Yes.
Our next question is from Ivana Ergovic from Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just a quick question about Homer City.
Are you able to actually burn a different coal such as PRB in order to comply with the requirements of CSAPR in the first phase? Pedro? Let me just answer it by saying that we have looked at a whole range of options in terms of compliance coal without giving a lot of details since I don't think we've disclosed legal specifics you get into questions about availability and price and sale.
That's all that's getting factored into the equation.
But we have looked at other options that include different types of options that include how you treat or manage the coal that you do have and continuing to pursue changes.
But I think if some of those could require permit changes and so that also would factor into the equation.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And another thing so should we assume that going forward I guess beyond 2012 a good ROE for transmission would be 11.1 or does this go down or up? I mean I guess you said it depends on the cash of the which has a better incentive.
We said it depends on the mix but we said for 2012 the return would be at 11.1%.
And that's going to go up or down depending upon the mix of actual construction expenditure that we end up incurring.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> But going forward is it more towards upside or is it going down from 11.1% beyond '12? I can't tell you right now.
We haven't put anything out there in the public domain.
It's going to be in the general ballpark.
And it has a small impact Ivana because when you look of the total rate base FERC is 15% of our total rate base so it's going to be small impacts if it's changing 5 or 10 basis points.
And that is all the time we have for questions today.
I will now turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone.
Please do follow up with Investor Relations if you have any other questions and we look forward to seeing a lot of you at the EEI Financial Conference next week.
Thank you.
Thank you and this concludes today's conference.
You may disconnect at this time.
Good afternoon.
My name is Sharon and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks Sharon and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
Ted's prepared remarks presentation that accompanies Jim's comments earnings press release and our Edison International 10-K are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
Tomorrow we will issue our regular quarterly business update presentation that will use these and other slides for ongoing investor discussions.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read them carefully.
Presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Today Edison International reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.75 per share and full year core earnings of $3.22 per share.
We are pleased that our fourth quarter results have allowed us to deliver 2011 core earnings well above the high end of our guidance range.
Southern California Edison Edison Mission Group and the parent all contributed to outperforming the earnings guidance.
Of particular note Southern California Edison's core earnings increased $0.20 in the quarter and $0.32 for the full year due to rate base growth and a favorable tax adjustment that Jim will discuss a little later.
Typically at this time of the year we provide earnings guidance for the coming year.
However we will not be providing 2012 guidance until we receive a final decision in Southern California Edison's General Rate Case which we hope will be in the first half of 2012.
In the absence of specific earnings guidance Jim will discuss some of the key drivers to our 2012 earnings in his remarks.
On a reported basis we showed a loss for the full year of $0.11 per share due primarily to impairment charges at EMG.
These impairment charges are largely the result of a sharp decline in power prices combined with the need for substantial investment in retrofits for our coal fleet to comply with environmental regulations.
I'll say more about those charges later during my remarks about EMG.
Let me begin by covering some recent developments at Southern California Edison.
First let me provide a brief update on the timing of the Southern California Edison's 2012 General Rate Case.
As of now we don't have a timeline for when we will get a final decision although we hope it'll be in the first half of the year.
Commission is aware of the need for a timely GRC decision and we expect a proposed decision will be forthcoming shortly.
But it is also important to remember that the final decision will be retroactive to January 1.
Our value proposition at Southern California Edison is driven by growth in capital investment which is expected to result in average annual growth in rate base of 7% to 9% through 2014.
This growth is largely driven by California policy mandates as well as infrastructure replacement to ensure public safety and reliability.
Over the last 5 years Southern California Edison has delivered compound annual growth in rate base of 11% and its core earnings have increased at a 12% compound annual growth rate.
One large component of SCE's capital program is investment in transmission to connect renewable generators such as the Tehachapi and Devers-Colorado River projects.
At these projects we are seeing higher costs to mitigate various environmental impacts and from permitting delays.
These additional costs are included in SCE's updated capital spending forecast.
I would also like to provide an update on the outage work taking place at our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station or at we refer to as SONGS.
Unit 2 is offline for a planned outage -- planned refueling outage and we took Unit 3 offline on January 31 to inspect a water leak in its steam generator.
Steam generators in Unit 2 were replaced in 2010 and Unit 3's were replaced in 2011.
Planned inspections of the steam generators in Unit 2 found isolated areas of wear in some of the heat transfer tubes.
We are in the process of preventively removing tubes from service as prescribed by industry guidelines and well within design margins for this kind of repair activity.
We are still conducting a battery of tests and performing a root cause evaluation on the Unit 3 tube water leak.
SCE is committed to the safe operation of SONGS and of course will not return the plant's generating units to service until we are entirely satisfied it is completely safe to do so.
Final update I will provide on SCE is that this year it will complete the installation of 5 million smart meters in a $1.2 billion infrastructure capital investment.
There were 3.8 million meters installed by the end of last year and the program is on schedule and on budget.
As the system is rolled out SCE is developing programs that provide customers with enhanced information and services on their energy usage while providing us with new tools to better manage outages.
We continue to see opportunities for this investment to enhance our customer service platform by facilitating energy efficiency and providing the ability to integrate customers' smart appliances and devices within the home.
Let me now turn to Edison Mission Group.
We continue to believe that a dual platform of regulated and competitive businesses best positions our company for the transformative change we believe will sweep across the electric power industry.
The last 18 months we have been focused on unlocking the option value at EMG by reducing and extending the timeline for required capital investments and creating new liquidity to provide additional time for our recovery in power and capacity prices.
However power prices have not recovered.
Indeed their deterioration accelerated late last year and early this year.
Additionally EMG's liquidity has been reduced in the near-term by losing its ability to monetize its tax losses until at least 2013 primarily because the federal stimulus program and especially the enactment of 50% and then 100% deductibility of bonus depreciation has created net operating losses in the consolidated EIX tax group.
These 2 factors have added to EMG's stressed condition.
Efforts to stabilize EMG continue focusing on cost effectively meeting its environmental requirements reducing its unsecured debt and diversifying its generation portfolio with additional natural gas and renewable generation.
Ultimately the test will be the ability to generate sufficient cash flows such that it can refinance a sustainable portion of its unsecured debt.
If current power market conditions persist EMG expects to incur further reductions in cash flow and earnings losses in 2012 and beyond.
Current conditions coupled with pending debt maturities and retrofit investments will strain EMG's liquidity such that it may need to divest assets and restructure or reorganize its capital structure to get through this period to see if option value is indeed there.
We have repeatedly said that EIX will be financially disciplined and not invest new funds into EMG unless we can see a clear and compelling path to obtaining both a return of and on any investment.
In the face of deteriorating financial conditions at EMG we reaffirm that pledge.
EMG will likewise maintain its financial discipline and the impairments being announced today demonstrate this as they reflect the decision not to invest or the reduced likelihood of investing in retrofits at certain coal plants.
$623 million after-tax impairment charge at Homer City reflects the assessment that EMG is not going to control this investment going forward.
This conclusion was reached when Homer City was unable to attract outside capital for its environmental retrofits under its current financial structure and current market conditions.
We are working with the owner-lessors to transition control of Homer City to them subject to their discussions with their bondholders.
Today we also announced a $386 million after-tax impairment charge on 3 of our Midwest Generation plants: Fisk Crawford and Waukegan.
We have also reached the conclusion that it is not economic to continue operating Fisk beyond 2012 or Crawford beyond 2014.
We retain flexibility on the decision whether to retrofit Waukegan since we don't have to make major capital commitments there for a while.
With the challenging market environment facing EMG primary focus is to preserve and enhance liquidity and seek a sustainable capital structure.
While the impairments reflect deteriorating conditions they also reflect this focus.
Reductions in spending at Fisk and Crawford and potentially Waukegan will help liquidity.
They also facilitate extending the timeline for deciding on retrofitting the remaining Midwest generation plants while maintaining full environmental compliance by burning ultra-low sulfur coal.
While EME terminated it's largely undrawn revolver in February termination of the revolver has the benefit of freeing up collateral for future debt financing.
Actions in our wind business reflect the focus on preserving and enhancing liquidity as well.
First EMG reduced development spending on its existing wind pipeline and rationalized development and support staff.
Second it continues to project-finance its existing wind portfolio.
This end during December of last year EMG closed a $242 million portfolio financing of 3 contracted wind projects representing 204 megawatts.
Third and perhaps most significantly a sizable equity financing was completed for EMG's wind developments.
On February 13 EMG received a $460 million commitment to facilitate the development of wind projects.
This unique structure involves the transfer of 3 operating EMG wind projects totaling 291 megawatts to a new venture with outside investors.
Also 2 projects in construction totaling 120 megawatts will be sold to the venture upon their completion.
This transaction will net EMG approximately $235 million as the 5 projects are transferred.
It also allows EMG to do additional development of wind projects without consuming its equity capital while retaining project upside after the investors achieved their targeted return.
Completing these strategic actions results in a more focused EMG better positioned to weather it's challenges.
Last summer I began saying that the next 6 to 12 months would likely be determinative for EMG and that during that time frame a number of important issues would need to get resolved.
That remains the case.
We have important steps that we will be addressing with investors in the coming months as we continue to focus on seeking shareholder value.
Those are the major topics I wanted to cover.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thank you Ted and good afternoon everyone.
Page 2 of the presentation summarizes the quarterly earnings comparison that Ted's already touched on.
Starting with Edison International Holding Company results for 2011.
As you can see they are a positive $0.02 per share due to some consolidated income tax benefits and a true-up -- through tax true-ups.
Turning to Page 3 SCE's fourth quarter core earnings increased to $0.76 per share up $0.20 from last year.
Higher earnings in the quarter were driven by rate-based growth and a cumulative adjustment to deferred income taxes related to nuclear fuel.
Although not in our guidance we did recognize $0.03 of energy efficiency earnings.
Ted has already walked through -- talked about the 2012 GRC for SCE.
Pending the final decision Southern California Edison is managing its current O&amp;M and capital spending at a run rate similar to 2011 levels.
Turning to Page 4 EMG lost $0.03 per share on the core basis compared to a positive $0.10 per share last year.
The merchant coal fleet has suffered from lower average realized energy and capacity prices and lower levels of generation.
Improved results from our renewable energy projects were partially offset by higher net interest from an increase in total amount of project finance debt and a reduction in capitalized interest.
Detailed operating metrics for the coal fleet are included in the presentation appendix.
Now I'd like to review the non-core charges at EMG on Page 5 starting with Homer City.
As previously reported during the second half of 2011 we conducted a bidding process to obtain capital funding for the Homer City scrubbers from third parties.
The processes failed to obtain sufficient interest.
As Ted mentioned Homer City is now working cooperatively with the owner-lessors to resolve funding for the scrubbers and transition control of the station over to them.
This process is moving on an accelerated basis in order to allow scrubber construction to begin.
As a result of the expectation that EMG's interest will be substantially or entirely diluted through that process EMG recorded a pretax impairment charge -- excuse me an impairment charge of $1.91 per share for EIX share.
In the event of a final decision to dispose of the interest EMG will record an additional charge and likely classify Homer City as a discontinued operations.
Homer City has a rent payment due on April 1 of this year.
Homer City believes it will not meet the covenant requirements and therefore be unable to make the required equity rent payment and there is no assurance that Homer City will be able to make other rent payments in the future.
In order to pay equity rent Homer City must meet historical and projected senior rent service coverage ratios of 1.7:1.
At year end 2011 Homer City's historical ratio was 1.18:1.
We have provided additional detail regarding Homer City in the EME and EIX 10-Ks.
Homer City's failure to make the April 1 equity rent payment will not result in cross defaults or trigger other covenant trips for EME or EIX.
Turning to Midwest Generation the substantial downward movement of power prices since the third quarter of last year and the need to preserve liquidity in light of the pending decisions on environmental retrofits EMG recorded $1.19 per share impairment charge related to Midwest Generation's Fisk Crawford and Waukegan stations.
EMG determined the fair value of these stations to be 0.
Other non-core charges in the quarter related to the reduction in EME's wind development program of $0.13; a write-down of Edison Capital investment and 3 aircraft leased to American Airlines $0.05; and a final payment from the sale of the March Point project that occurred in 2010 a positive $0.02.
As a result of the impairment-related non-core charges Edison International parent company recorded a $0.06 per share charge related to adjustments in deferred taxes.
I won't go into our full year results in the interest of time.
These results are summarized on Pages 6 through 8 of the presentation and they are consistent with our ongoing message that rate-based growth will increase SCE's earnings while lower gross margins for the merchant coal fleet have and will adversely impact EME's earnings.
To emphasize the utility's value proposition Page 9 provides the historical compound annual growth rates for both rate base and core earnings since 2006.
As the chart demonstrates SCE has delivered 12% core earnings growth and 11% rate base growth over the last 5 years.
Page 10 provides an updated capital expenditure forecast.
The 3-year forecast yields $11.8 billion to $13.2 billion of capital expenditures through 2014.
The major changes to the forecast include upward revisions to the expected cost of transmission projects most notably the Tehachapi and Devers-Colorado River renewable transmission projects.
These cost increases have been partially offset by other transmission reliability projects which were deferred.
On Page 11 is the resulting forecast of rate base through the end of 2014 which ties to SCE's 3-year rate case cycle.
During this 3-year period compound average rate base growth is forecasted to be 7% to 9%.
The updated rate base growth reflects the expected gradual decline in forecast capital expenditures.
Page 12 provides the current hedge positions for energy and coal for Homer City and Midwest Generation.
Homer City is in a state of transition so we have purposely not entered into new hedges and have closed out other positions.
The substantial reduction in power prices and some limited coal to gas switching in ComEd we would expect that the historical generation and related coal consumption at Midwest Generation will not be indicative in the current environment.
I'd also like to touch a little bit on the new rail contract with Union Pacific for the Midwest Generation fleet.
Midwest Gen entered into a new multiyear rail contract in the fourth quarter effective January 1 2012.
Under this agreement the estimated transportation cost is $386 million for 2012.
The cost may also increase based on a number of factors provided under the terms of the contract.
Under the new contract Midwest Gen may reduce its minimum requirements in the event of a plant shutdown under certain circumstances.
Overall we see roughly a 1/3 increase in Midwest Gen's delivered coal cost.
EMG has decided to pursue an ultra-low sulfur strategy for its Midwest Gen fleet which will permit deferral of environmental capital expenditures.
Based on 2011 data Midwest Generation's fleet was meeting the 2013 EPS requirements of 0.44 pounds per MMBtu for SO2 emissions through the use of low sulfur coal.
On Page 13 is the revised capital expenditure forecast.
This new forecast reflects changes in timing for environmental retrofits and the Midwest Gen stations previously provided a cost estimate to install environmental upgrades of $1.2 billion for all Midwest Generation stations.
The updated forecast of up to $628 million is to retrofit just the larger Midwest Gen units or Powerton 5 and 6 Joliet 7 and 8 and Will County 3 and 4.
Although it is less likely that we will do so the estimated cost to retrofit the smaller stations Waukegan 7 and 8 and Joliet 6 is about $235 million.
The remaining capital expenditures are mostly for the construction of the Walnut Creek natural gas-fired plant and the Crofton Bluffs and Broken Bow wind projects.
Page 14 is the updated wind development chart.
We have updated this chart to reflect the February closing of our wind capital raise which Ted has already discussed.
In addition to this strategic value for remaining active in development markets the liquidity benefits for EMG are significant.
As a result of the Capistrano Wind Partners equity raise and the recent Tapestry debt raise in December EME now has 1 406 megawatts of projects that are financed.
Of the remaining 575 megawatts that are not financed 387 megawatts are contracted.
Lastly as a result of capital resource constraints and limited market opportunities the development pipeline of potential wind projects has been reduced to 1 300 megawatts from 3 800 megawatts.
Turning to Page 15 EME's corporate cash position is mainly cash at EME and EMMT improved in the fourth quarter to $951 million a $217 million increase over last quarter.
Overall in 2011 EME improved its liquidity to the receipt of $388 million of U.S.
Treasury grants $167 million from wind financings -- wind financing distributions and $213 million of tax sharing agreement payments from Edison International.
Deferral of payments under the tax-sharing agreements impacts EMG's liquidity although it does not have an impact on earnings.
As of December 31 EMG recognized $520 million in future tax benefits related to net operating losses and PTC carryforwards under tax-sharing agreements.
The right of EMG to receive in the amount of and timing of tax allocation payments are dependent upon EIX's consolidated tax position.
Based on current tax law EMG is not expected to monetize tax benefits until at least 2013.
Also EMG expects to return tax allocation payments to EIX during 2012 of approximately $185 million.
Lastly permanent closure of merchant coal plants would add to EMG's tax loss position.
One important item to note on February 27 EME terminated its $600 million revolving credit facility to save fees primarily because Homer City was part of the collateral package and the line therefore became effectively not usable.
This termination will also release other collateral as Ted said.
EME facility was due to mature on June 15 of this year and the facility was largely unutilized.
The Midwest Gen credit facility still remains outstanding and expires on June 29 of this year.
Page 16 replaces our usual guidance slide in an effort to provide our investors with some of the operating assumptions for 2012.
That concludes my comments.
Operator let's move to Q&amp;A.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> I have one question and briefly perusing the 10-K you talked about in the event that you transfer the ownership of Homer -- if you cease to become the controller of Homer City that there would potentially be both ongoing contingencies? Could you speak to what that might refer to? Okay just briefly there's a lot of detail in the Ks that I think you can sort through once you have a little bit of time to look at it.
So we impaired investment of Homer City at EME and there are some additional assets that reside that have not been impaired yet.
And so when you actually get to the completion when we actually transfer the asset there's approximately I think the disclosure say about $170 million of net remaining investments that we would need to write off.
The timing from that is uncertain.
We're still working through that.
I can't give you an expected time frame right yet.
It depends upon how it goes with the owner-lessors.
There may be some additional items that come up during the course of the discussions and we're trying to define exactly what the liabilities are on either side.
But the principle liabilities have been disclosed in our 10-K.
Research Division</strong> It's not some sort of ongoing exposure? It's more write off of an existing asset that just hasn't yet been written down? We would take it to -- there would be no ongoing exposure.
We'd take it 0.
Research Division</strong> And secondly Ted talked about it still being the case that there are important issues that need to get resolved in the 6- to 12-month time frame contrary from the summer was still valid.
Can you just sort of give us some roadmap as to now that this -- with where you are here on Homer presumably final resolution of that is one of those items but just talk us through some of the other points on the road Ted? Jonathan it's Ted.
I think kind of the principle ones are EPA rules need to be finalized.
I think we've got a pretty good sense of what those look like.
But as you know there are a couple of important elements still yet to be fully finalized.
That in turn would give us a better read on timing and amount of expenditures for retrofits.
Second kind of key one is some of the additional liquidity activities.
We still have some parts of our wind portfolio that have the ability for additional financing.
So continuing to look at those things.
We also talked a little bit about the new equity capital program that we have for the wind development.
But in order to realize all of the cash from that we've got work to get completed.
And then I think another important milestone from our perspective is what happens in the capacity market auction in May.
That certainly will speak to this kind of byplay between very depressed power prices making many of the existing generation facilities uneconomic in the PJM marketplace.
We're seeing a lot of announced retirements not just stars but others.
So what impact will that have on the capacity market? I think those are some of the key milestones.
There's other stuff that the folks at EMG keep working on to improve liquidity and pull some additional rabbits out of the hat.
But the big ones are the ones I mentioned.
Research Division</strong> And can I just follow up on capacity auction on Homer City and the timing here during the previous auctions EMMT has been placing that capacity into the auction I guess.
What should we anticipate would happen going into this coming auction with you -- assuming that say the ownership still sort of is somewhat in limbo? Jonathan it's Jim.
I think you just should assume Homer City would fit in to auction.
We anticipate the units being available in the future.
We'll have to work that out between ourselves and the owner-lessors.
The next question comes from Dan Eggers of Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> I guess just on the Midwestern impairments this quarter what was the threshold Jim made you to decide that these assets will be impaired and other assets would not be impaired? And where would the next decision point be if other assets were to be impaired along the way? I think every quarter you have to go through the impairment analysis.
It's a standard accounting approach.
And what happened between last quarter and this quarter is really the drop in power prices changed the economics.
I think the reality of that and given the problems that we've been facing especially with the in-city the Fisk and Crawford stations I think the economics came through that it was clear that it was time to impair those stations.
Now we also impaired the Waukegan station.
But we haven't made a final determination yet in terms of what we're going to do there.
But the reality was that the economics were clear that we needed to take an action.
Now we'll continue to look at the other what you're implying the other smaller stations but we haven't made any conclusions.
And the current plan is then to retrofit the larger stations and we're proceeding down that path.
Research Division</strong> And I guess Ted if I could just read your script and maybe this is the hard part about putting out your script but toward the end when you talk about the financially discipline not invest new funds in EMG unless we can see a clear and compelling path can you help us understand what a clear and compelling path would be relative to not putting capital into the business as you guys have avoided that for so long? Yes I don't think you should expect any change in our viewpoint on it.
In fact that's why the next sentence is in this script too.
In the face of deteriorating financial conditions which have clearly deteriorated you can expect we will not be putting any funds in EMG.
Research Division</strong> I guess the primary season is coming out -- too many sound bites I just want to make sure I had that right.
And then I guess the last question is Homer City will be taken out of recurring earnings going forward so in '12 that will have no bearing on your results from an operating perspective? Most likely.
Yes.
As We move it into discontinued operations that would be the case you'd have to pluck it out.
Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> One short-term question one long-term question.
On the shutdown of some of the Midwest Gen units how should we think about the O&amp;M savings that comes with that? Okay.
Michael this is Jim.
We'll incorporate that into our operating assumptions.
The problem here we haven't given you guidance in terms of what we expect EBITDA or earnings would be for the facilities.
And we'll do that as we get the SCE's General Rate Case.
But there will be operating savings capital reductions that go along with the shutdowns.
Research Division</strong> And thinking longer term if there's a scenario where EME has to go through some kind of restructuring not just asset sales but literally restructuring of the debt how does the NOL at EME get treated in a situation like that? And is EIX -- I don't want to use the word -- I guess use the words on-the-hook for ensuring that EME in a restructured environment gets access to the cash flow it would have gotten had it stayed within the broader EIX umbrella? Okay that's a complicated question.
I think just go back to the most simplest form.
EIX the way it works under the tax-sharing agreement it uses a consolidated approach.
So therefore if the consolidated return has available capacity to monetize tax benefits then the dollars flow either to SCE or EMG based on the actual situation.
Now if an entity were deconsolidated from the parent it could then no longer monetize tax losses that reside within that entity.
And so I think that's the simplest way that you can think about it.
Research Division</strong> But could that entity if deconsolidated would be deconsolidated and would effectively be able to over its own time and course assuming financial conditions permit be able to monetize that NOL on its own? The NOL would reside with that entity if it were deconsolidated.
And then whatever happens going forward it would depend upon the earnings and losses of that entity.
It would not affect the consolidated entity of EIX.
Our next question comes from Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.
Research Division</strong> Jim just to follow up on the last question and maybe I'm reading too much into your comments.
Discontinued operations is this going to happen not going to happen? I just try and understand what would be the determining factors.
Since you wrote it down it appears you're transferring it to the owner-lessor.
Would seem like that sort of a no-brainer but maybe I'm misunderstanding that.
I think you got right.
So once we've finalized this transition and we don't know when it's going to be over we would likely at that point move it to discontinued operations.
Research Division</strong> So there's no question it's going there.
It's just more your sort of hesitancy there was when it's going to happen not if it's going to happen? It's the likely outcome.
Research Division</strong> What would make it not the outcome? It's going to go down a transition path.
I guess I don't want to go through every possible avenue here but we expect it at some point in time to go to discontinued operations.
Research Division</strong> So you've written off your entire equity interest so the way it wouldn't go to discontinued operation is if you thought there was still some value there? Is that the fairest way to think or maybe not the fairest the simplest way to think about it? No the way it is just for clarification we believe the fair value of Homer City is 0.
The way have to go through it the accounting is complicated and it's very clear if I model it here in the disclosures in terms of how it's treated.
So we take in the first step it essentially wrote off the majority of the investment.
There's a portion of the investment that's at fair value and that's the remaining piece that will once we transition it to discontinued operations will have to be written off.
Research Division</strong> That's the $170 million you were speaking of earlier? Yes.
Research Division</strong> And then Ted back to the 6 to 12 months I think as you said in the script there were certainly those of us who've been listening have heard it since round about last summer.
So roughly June or about the time we'll have results for the PGM capacity auction would be sort of that line in the sand.
Should we continue to think about it? I mean I guess some of us still struggle with this at a firm 6 to 12 months or is it a rolling 6 to 12 months.
And understand the variables continue to change not all of which are helpful but maybe just sort of reaffirm your sort of message on that if you would? Yes I'll reaffirm it and clarify it to some degree.
It was last summer that I started talking about 6 to 12 months which is basically trying to suggest between the EPA rules that we knew were going to end up having to be promulgated by the end of the year which would be the 6 months to all the way around to the auction which would take place in May which is getting pretty close to 12 months we figured that by summer of 2012 we would have most of the factors that we needed to come to conclusions about which units would be retrofitted therefore what the capital cost would be.
If we were to not retrofit certain units and close them down what would be the savings that would come from that? And how would we kind of refocus EMG as a result of those decisions which would fill in one of the big blanks that is what's the capital requirement for retrofits of the coal fleet.
The second part is we were going to start facing some retirements in the revolver the maturity of the revolver.
And then fairly soon after that we'd be into the $500 million of the 2013s and so on.
And our keen desire is to kind of take all those factors as well as our outlook for where power prices would be and conclude whether we could really stabilize EMG or not.
And the stabilization is meeting the capital requirements as well as trying to pay down a healthy chunk of debt particularly the debt maturing in 2013 2016 such that we would have sufficient credit metrics for EMG to be self-sustaining or that said differently refinance its 2017 and beyond on the basis of its own credit metrics.
That to us was the definition of stabilization.
We felt we would have most of the information we would need coupled with some outlooks on power prices to conclude whether we in fact could stabilize EMG.
And we still are on that path as I said in my prepared remarks.
But still our intention is some time in the summer of this year being able to have those discussions with investors.
Obviously main part of the plan that has not worked is power prices recovery.
They have not recovered they've only gotten worse.
So that constrains cash it constrains our liquidity that makes the ability to stabilize EMG much more difficult.
Research Division</strong> And I guess the last follow-up on that and I'm sure you don't want to get into your proprietary view of power prices but would it be fair to say if power prices remain on about the forward curve where they are right now we need to pursue some sort of restructuring? As we said in the script we would need to -- if these conditions persist we would need to consider divesting assets to raise liquidity and consider restructuring or reorganizing the capital structure.
So we won't make any predictions as to where all of that goes at this point but if we have a prolonged period of low power prices it constrains the liquidity sufficiently that we'd have to consider those other actions.
Jay I'll just add to that too I know you're listening that I think we've had our view and we've heard -- you've heard it from us any number of times as we've entered into the agreement with Illinois EPA that we believe strongly that coal plants would be shutting down and we're seeing that now and that would lead to an improvement in capacity values.
I think the question that Ted was addressing you were raising had to do with energy values.
But we still hold the view capacity values re-rising in the PJM market.
Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> Just to maybe follow-on with Jay's question.
We still have pretty liquid or good debt markets and loan markets.
And let's say those allow you to deal with a lot of the near-term maturities the 2013s and that gives you at this point maybe another 3-year time line is that enough? Or do you need to be able to prove that there's value out till 2016 '17 ? Because as you know there'll be a lot of assumptions that need to have made to deal with that? Steve this is Ted.
It's going to be difficult to foresee all of the different possibilities here.
But let me try to give you a general steer of the way we're thinking about it.
If all we're doing is kind of limping from one quarter to the next we don't really see how we reach a stabilization of EME.
And that's not a very appealing prospect from our perspective.
So we are to some degree seeking to force the question will we be able to stabilize EMG? And as I said I think that fundamentally means we have to be able to meet the capital requirements for the retrofits of the plants that we do believe are economic and should continue to run.
Number two we have to take out some debt.
And we have to be able to see somewhere over this next 3 to 4 years that we'll be able to generate sufficient liquidity to meet those CapEx requirements and reduce debt such that by the time we get to the '17s we can see that this is going to actually generate sufficient credit metrics for refinancing.
If we can't see how that looks possible then I don't think we have a stabilized entity and we'll just be lurching from quarter-to-quarter.
So our goal here and again come back to the 6- to 12-month kind of concept is by the summer that we have a sharp idea of whether or not we'll be able to stabilize EMG.
Research Division</strong> And just to clarify in the event that you determine that you won't be able to stabilize it what exactly do you do? I mean you're already not committing any new money to it.
So what are the exact things you would actually then do if you make that determination? I think at that point you're looking at restructuring reorganizing the capital structure.
I don't think there's any other outcome.
Research Division</strong> I'm going to go so far as actually asking a utility question...
It's entirely acceptable.
Research Division</strong> Since it's probably more than 100% of the value of the company.
The one thing you didn't mention that occurred I think since your last call was these windstorms that you had and seem like you had a decent amount of reaction to that.
Could you just give us some sense of kind of what happened there? And is there anything operationally you're changing in reaction to that and how you're thinking about that? Steve we'll have Ron Litzinger address that.
Yes Steve clearly there's been the report by the consumer protection and safety division the public participation hearing that occurred on the regulatory front.
From our perspective we have done a thorough root cause evaluation of our response in the windstorm.
We will be coming out with that report shortly and we've agreed to share that with the commission.
And in addition to that we have engaged an independent consulting firm to do an independent evaluation of our performance as well which we will take note of and make our corrections to our practices and our procedures going forward.
The next question comes from Jon Cohen of ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> I just had a question about your interim environmental compliance strategy using ultra-low sulfur coal.
How many years do you think that will allow you to sort of scape by under the CPS-mandated emissions limits? And will that get you out to the '15 '16 time frame or is that going to be earlier than that? I think just -- we're not going to give you amounts or how much we're buying and what the price and whatnot.
I think just bear in mind that we're going to do a combination of things.
It's going to be low sulfur coal and we'll be installing removal technology.
And we have very steep reductions that are required because low sulfur coal will only get you so far.
And as you look at the CPS numbers out beyond '14 there are steep drop-offs.
So that's where you really require capital expenditures for the dry sorbent injection systems to get you to those lower levels.
Research Division</strong> I think that answered the question.
So 2014 is where the sort of threshold is.
I wouldn't stop there.
You would continue using it and in combination of the equipment that's how much dry sorbent you need to inject.
So there's a combination of things you do here to get to the numbers that are -- that's part of the agreement.
Research Division</strong> And then one other question on your coal contract.
You mentioned that if you shutdown plants the volumes under the contract reduce.
Are there minimum volumes that are allocated to the plant level? In other words are there minimum volumes for Powerton Joliet and Will County? I can't get into the specifics of the contract but there's a mechanism we have in place that we can adjust accordingly based on the plant that's taken out of service.
The next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to follow-up real quick on that last point on the transportation.
That $386 million a year that you mentioned does that already contemplate the potential closures the Homer City withdrawal and then just kind of a mark-to-market dispatch at current market conditions? Or is there a downside potential for that $386 million? I think based on the disclosures we had to go through and expected amounts reflects that.
To the extent that we shutdown plants in the future because we're looking at the plant shutdowns don't occur until '13 and beyond.
So I wouldn't expect to affect the '12.
Research Division</strong> And then on the potential legal challenges do you think there's anything there for HAPs MACT like you guys went through with Casper? And how could some kind of legal developments that you're involved in relate to your decisions around what to do with Homer City or anything at the Midwest Gen? We'll have Pedro Pizarro address that.
Yes.
Just briefly on HAPs MACT I can't speculate on whether others may file legal challenges or how the courts will view that.
I will say that we have been generally supportive of the final form of HAPs MACT or MATS as it's now called.
So we're certainly at this point not contemplating a challenge.
On Casper we did file the challenge there or Homer City actually filed the legal challenge there.
And those -- they're not of Homer City given the impacts on the Homer City project we've disclosed that we don't foresee significant impacts from Casper as written the Midwest Gen fleet.
So the Homer City will continue to pursue its legal path as the court now has granted the motion for stay and we'll be going into our hearings later this year.
Research Division</strong> And then one quick.
Is the oil peaker at Fisk included in the shutdown? No.
Research Division</strong> That will continue running? It's not part of the shutdown.
Our next question comes from Paul Fremont of Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I guess first question would be it looks like -- or if I understood you correctly the write-off of the 3 EMG units resulted in a $0.06 tax benefit to the -- on a consolidated basis to the holding company.
What would -- are you able to quantify what the associated tax benefit would be if the rest of EMG were written-off? Paul I think you got the -- there's different things that are going on here so let me step back for a second.
If you look at Page 5 of our investor deck the write-off all the write-offs that occurred the impairment charges that were taken in the fourth quarter resulted in a non-core charge at the holding company of $0.06.
There is also in core earnings a deferred tax adjustment that was a positive.
So one's in non-core one's in core.
I just wanted to make sure I clarify what was going on there.
And it is hard to keep track of both these things.
But I can tell you if we're to write-off the whole thing what the deferred tax adjustment would be for the holding company the reason for the non-core $0.06 adjustment that occurred at the holding company in the fourth quarter has to do with how state income taxes the apportioned state income taxes that is a very complicated and detailed discussion and I just don't have any information that I can get into you on any kind of relevant degree.
But periodically and I think you'll remember last year every once in a while based on the way income is a apportioned through our various companies we will either take a benefit or take a loss depending upon how we foresee the apportionment changing.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> So I guess what I'm trying to get at is is there a way to determine what the worthless tax deductions would be associated with an EMG write-down? Unfortunately we have not put that information in the public domain.
You can see the book value of the remaining Midwest Gen assets that is now clearly spelled out in the disclosures.
We've previously showed that to you in a prior quarter.
And you can see what's happening with Homer City.
So a lot of the information as far as the book value perspective is in the public domain.
We just don't have the tax basis in there.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And then moving on to the utility.
It seems every -- it seems if you basically just take the rate base equity ratio and the ROE the company keeps coming in sort of at levels that are above what would be implied.
So is there something that we need to think about from a modeling perspective either efficiency adders or other incentives when we model SCE on a going-forward basis? I think we're going to continue to provide information using what we'll call the simplified methodology the one you started with.
There are things that occur year-to-year and I think we had some tax benefits that flowed through in the fourth quarter that's why you're seeing some of the outperformance.
At times embedded cost of debt provides a benefit but you can have other parts of the business where you're overspending.
So that covers -- so we have outperformance in one area can cover underperformance in others.
So we're going to keep coming back to that simplified approach.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And then just following up on Steve's question on the OII.
You have another OII that's outstanding relating to the Santa Barbara fires and that seems to be taking forever in terms of getting through that proceeding? Is there anything in terms of the claims arising from Santa Barbara that would allow us to make an assessment on sort of the monetary exposure in the windstorms? Yes.
Let me just clarify on that and we'll turn it over to Ron to give you some additional details.
So that's the Malibu fire situation and there's additional disclosures that's updated in the 10-K when you have an opportunity to take a look at that.
But I'll turn it over to Ron now.
Yes the Malibu Fire OII is continuing.
That proceeding continues.
It has been a long one.
Just to be clear with regard to the OII from the San Gabriel Valley windstorm there has not been an OII announced at this point.
This concludes the question-and-answer session.
At this time I will turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone.
Please don't hesitate to follow-up this evening I know for a lot of you and certainly tomorrow for any follow-up questions.
Thanks very much.
This concludes today's conference.
Thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Good afternoon.
My name is Sharon and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International First Quarter 2012 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks Sharon and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our 10-Q filings are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
Tomorrow afternoon we will issue our regular quarterly business update presentation that will use of these and other slides for our ongoing investor discussions.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
[Operator Instructions] With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thanks Scott and good morning -- or good afternoon everyone.
Today we reported GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share.
As expected a decline from the $0.61 per share last year.
Core earnings were $0.35 per share compared to $0.65 per share a year ago.
There are 2 high-level points I would like to make about our first quarter earnings.
Southern California Edison's first quarter results reflect a mismatch of costs and revenues given the delay in receiving our General Rate Case decision.
Once the California Public Utilities Commission issues a final decision revenues will be recognized retroactively to the beginning of the year.
Second in anticipation of transferring EMG's Homer City plant to the owner-lessors we reclassified Homer City's $0.03 per share loss last year and this year's $0.07 per share loss into noncore earnings.
I would like to update you on a few important matters since our year-end earnings call.
Let me start with the cost of capital application Southern California Edison filed with the CPUC on April 20.
SCE's application recommended continuing its current capital structure of 48% equity 43% long-term debt and 9% preferred stock with a recommended ROE of 11.1% down from the current 11.5%.
SCE also recommended continuation of the same automatic trigger mechanism which has been in place for several years that uses the Moody's Baa utility bond index.
We recommended this mechanism be continued for a 3-year cycle and adjusting the baseline to reflect the 12-month average of the index at September 30 of this year.
SCE's proposal would result in a 2013 reduction in customer rates of $128 million about half associated with the lower ROE and the other half related to the true-up of our embedded cost of debt and preferred stock.
Hearings are anticipated in late summer or early fall with a final CPUC decision by year end and effective January 1 of next year.
There are summaries of the filing and an illustrative example of the index mechanism in the presentation appendix.
Let me now turn to our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
SCE is continuing to assess the causes of the steam generator leak discovered January 31 at Unit 3 working together with the NRC the manufacturer and other consultants and industry experts.
Over the last 3 months we have been conducting a battery of tests and studying the phenomenon causing the tube wear.
We have identified some unusual wear in approximately 1% of the nearly 39 000 steam generator tubes that transfer heat to produce the steam which drives the turbines and generates the electricity.
While tube wear is to be expected we are taking this very seriously since it is occurring in newly installed steam generators.
When we are satisfied that we sufficiently understand the mechanisms and the causes of the wear we will seek confirmation of our remediation plan with the NRC.
The plan will likely follow standard industry practice of plugging stabilizing and removing from service all affected tubes along with some other operational changes.
We are absolutely committed to the safe operation of San Onofre and will not return the units to service until we and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are completely satisfied it is safe to do so.
It is possible the time required to do all this will keep one or both of the units offline into the summer straining our ability to meet peak electricity demand.
Therefore we have been working with the California Independent System Operator and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric on power supply contingency plans for this summer.
Those plans include transmission upgrades bringing idled plants owned by other companies back into service conservation and demand response programs to reduce the possibility of service interruptions.
I'd like to turn next to EMG and come back to several key points I made on our year-end earnings call.
First is our strategic intent.
I want to reiterate what I said on the last call that we continue to believe that a dual platform of regulated and competitive businesses best positions our company for the significant change we expect in the electric power industry.
Second I reaffirm our commitment that we will not invest new funds into EMG given the challenging market conditions.
Finally given the simultaneous need to retrofit the Midwest Generation fleet and meet future debt maturities at a time when power and capacity prices are at a cyclical low I stated that a restructuring or reorganization of EME's capital structure may be needed.
Further to this point we take note of reports that EME bondholders may be seeking to organize themselves.
We continue to believe this year will be definitive for EMG in terms of making decisions about the path forward.
I would like to review some of the important decisions made since our last earnings call and some of those to be made in the months ahead.
Let me start with Homer City.
EMG continues to work with GE Capital to transfer Homer City to the owner-lessors.
On March 29 Homer City and GE Capital signed an agreement that sets forth a road map for completing the transfer.
Turning to Midwest Generation.
EMG has accelerated the timeline for closure of the Fisk and Crawford facilities to September 2012.
EMG has also requested a 1-year extension to December 2014 of the compliance deadline for environmental retrofits at Waukegan Unit 7.
The closure of Fisk and Crawford stations and the resulting emissions reductions more than offset any impact of a 1-year extension at Waukegan and give EMG more time to assess capacity market and forward power prices that will affect final retrofit decisions.
EMG continues to implement its renewables financing strategies.
These will enhance liquidity while allowing EMG to grow its renewables investments through the Capistrano venture announced in February.
With those comments I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thanks Ted and good morning -- I did it too.
Good afternoon everyone.
Ted has already touched on the high-level first quarter comparisons which are summarized on Page 2 of the presentation.
Please note that the first quarter holding company costs of $0.02 per share are in line with our normal quarterly trend.
Turning to Page 3.
The delay in the 2012 CPUC General Rate Case decision that Ted mentioned impacted first quarter earnings by about $0.08 per share.
Our first quarter CPUC revenues are largely based on 2011 authorized revenues.
As a result higher costs in the first quarter are not currently being recovered including higher depreciation and new debt and preferred stock costs.
When SCE receives its final GRC decision it will record the revenue retroactively through January 1.
The remaining $0.03 negative variance is lower AFUDC as SCE is utilizing more short-term debt in 2012.
In addition SCE incurred $0.04 per share of unplanned outage inspection and repair cost at San Onofre reflecting the $20 million pretax figure that Ted mentioned.
During the first quarter inspection and repair costs were largely offset by lower operation and maintenance costs in other areas of the company.
Subject to the NRC review under the confirmatory action letter and any new developments that may result from further analysis testing and inspection SCE's estimated share of the total incremental inspection and repair costs associated with returning the units to service remains uncertain but is currently projected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million pretax.
Currently SCE is expensing the SONGS inspection and repair cost as incurred.
And such cost will as appropriate be offset later to recognize recoveries SCE obtains under the warranty applicable to the steam generators.
Replacement power costs are recorded in the fuel and purchased power balancing accounts but are subject to later reasonableness review by the CPUC.
As a result of this treatment there is no impact on 2012 earnings.
There were no significant changes to SCE's capital spending or rate case forecast and the details are included in the appendix.
EMG results are shown on Page 4 and reflect the treatment of Homer City as noncore for both periods.
EMG's first quarter core loss increased by $0.17 per share from lower generation lower average realized energy and capacity prices along with higher fuel costs at Midwest Gen.
Reduced generation resulted from lower economic dispatch increased planned maintenance outages and thermal discharge limits at 2 stations in March due to unseasonably warm weather.
Our regular Midwest Gen operating report summary hedge position and capacity market summaries are contained in the appendix.
There were no significant hedge or coal procurement transactions in the quarter.
On Page 5 presents 2011 quarterly and full year EPS results for Homer City that can be used for updating models.
With the expected pending transfer of Homer City to the owner-lessors we are no longer including Homer City-specific information in our presentation and earnings commentary.
It remains in the 10-Q disclosures for those that want the information.
On March 29 Homer City and GE Capital entered into an implementation agreement and both parties are now working on related agreements for the construction of environmental improvements at Homer City and the transition of the plant to the owner-lessors.
GE Capital and certain of the Homer City debt holders have been in discussions regarding the terms of the existing secured lease obligation bonds and funding for the scrubbers.
At this time it is uncertain when Homer City will transition to the owner-lessors.
Ted already mentioned that we will close Fisk and Crawford stations in September.
When this occurs EME will record a tax deduction equal to the remaining tax basis of the assets.
At March 31 2012 the tax basis for Fisk was $64 million and the tax basis for Crawford was $87 million.
I'd like to turn now to EMG's wind financing and capital raise strategy on Page 6.
EMG continues to make progress implementing this strategy which now includes the Capistrano Wind Partners venture that closed in February.
In the first quarter EMG completed a new $98 million project financing for the 2 wind projects under construction in Nebraska Broken Bow and Crofton Bluffs.
EMG's capital spending plans which are shown on Page 7 are essentially unchanged from what we discussed last quarter.
The scope in the forecast includes basic maintenance capital spending the large unit environmental retrofit program at Midwest Gen and completion of the 2 Nebraska wind projects this year and the Walnut Creek gas-fired project next year.
All of the growth investments now have dedicated construction financings in place which will convert to permanent financings upon completion of construction.
Turning to Page 8.
At March 31 EME had liquidity of just over $1.3 billion and had recognized $908 million of tax benefits from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards compared to $520 million at the end of last year.
We expect deferred tax benefits to increase based on further operating losses plant closures and from recognition of ongoing wind production tax credits.
Last quarter we had reported that EME would make a tax allocation payment to EIX of $185 million but this amount may be substantially offset by tax allocation payments to EME by Edison International.
Page 9 covers the same key points as our year-end presentation.
As we have previously said we will not provide earnings guidance for 2012 until after the CPUC GRC is final.
We do however anticipate that EMG's full year adjusted EBITDA will be negative.
This concludes my comments.
And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for the questions and answers.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> I guess on EMG at this point with a -- your continuing deterioration in fundamentals can you just -- if you want to share any more thoughts on how you're evaluating that project and maybe how you could advance the conversation with the bondholders if the capital restructuring is a viable option for the timetable you guys have discussed for coming to a solution? Dan this is Ted.
I think we're getting to that spot on EMG particularly as it relates to potential discussions with bondholders that just frankly is not going to be helpful or wise for us to kind of weight in and speculate on how those things might go.
So I'm afraid you're going to kind of more likely than not get responses from us on those types of questions.
We're just going to have to see how it develops.
I think we've tried to lay out -- tried to lay it out in my comments that the fundamental approach is we believe that there needs to be some sort of -- some element of work with the bonds looking at the capital structure restructuring the capital.
And that's going to most likely lead to a conversation with the bondholders.
And that's probably just where we need to leave it at this point.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
That's fair.
And I guess just on the outlook for SCE this year.
I know you've pulled guidance.
But if we thought about how it will work once the GRC gets done is it fair to assume this year you do still expect to yield or earn your allowed ROE at SCE less the $55 million or $60 million for the SONGS cost which would presumably get recovered maybe next year once the warranty work gets resolved? That thing that's -- this is Jim Dan.
I think it's the key we're going to need to get before for us is a General Rate Case decision.
And you have all the metrics that we've been using for year-after-year.
But the key piece that's missing here is the proposed decision is the first step and ultimately a final decision.
And once we have this -- that in hand then we'll be able to give you a good assessment of where we think 2012 is going to come out.
Next question comes from Jay Dobson.
Research Division</strong> Wanted to follow up a little bit maybe if we could just talk EMG and just what capacity factors we sort of saw in the quarter.
I'm not sure if a lot of that information was in the handout Jim.
But just talk about given coal-to-gas switching and these sort of things what we saw? Okay.
The information is included in the deck.
I'm just going to flip through it and probably tell you what page it's on and I'll stop for a second.
There was some limited coal-to-gas switching that we saw.
In fact in my comments we talked about 3 areas where we saw reduced generation.
And we think it had to do with the coal-to-gas switching for a piece of it higher planned maintenance quarter-over-quarter and some thermal limits that we encountered because of the unseasonably warm weather in March.
So that dropped the generation and some of the capacity factors for the Midwest Gen units.
So I'll pause there.
Can you see it? Page 33 Jay.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Perfect.
I'll take a look at that.
And then going back to San Onofre I just want to understand your comments.
The $55 million to $65 million you're talking about pretax cost return.
That's the total cost so you're including in that what you've spent in the first quarter? Yes.
Research Division</strong> And how...
I just want to sure it's clear.
Pretax.
Research Division</strong> And how would that roll over the year? I mean obviously when it comes back is an important element in that.
But if we were to assume it wasn't coming back for summertime is what we've seen in the first quarter a reasonable run rate? Or just how should we think about those flowing? And I know it's a difficult question because we don't know or you don't know when it's coming back.
Okay.
I'm going to turn this over to Ron.
He'll give you some more detail around that.
Yes.
The $55 million to $65 million is what we are projecting for repair cost.
And I want to keep those distinct from replacement fuel costs.
And staying with the repair cost that's what we're projecting.
We still have a long way to go to finalize that.
But that's where we think we'll end up and then we can seek recovery under the warranty.
Replacement power which we had in the disclosures for the first quarter which is around $30 million we also disclosed that those costs would be substantially higher in the summertime.
Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> I think my question was pretty much answered.
But just to follow up a little bit on SONGS.
The process here is that you'll determine what the costs are expected to be and then make a claim under the warranty.
So it will be kind of -- or will you need to expense everything and then claim back later? So this is Jim.
And I'll start then Ron can fill in.
So what we've done already we've expensed all the costs to date and we gave you numbers for what we think it's going to cost to bring the units back online.
That's the $55 million to $65 million pretax based on the current plan.
And so we'll continue to expense them as we incur them then we will look to seek recovery based on what we believe is appropriate under the warranty.
Ron would you like to add anything more? Yes.
The primary focus now is identifying the root cause so that we can return the units to service at some point.
We are working cooperatively with MHI as Ted stated and just add that additional fact.
Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just looking through some of the transmission project data in one of the back slides I noticed that some of the projects that are due on online or operational next year they're like 16% 18% done.
Devers-Colorado is 18% complete.
Eldorado-Ivanpah is 6% complete.
And just wondering how you feel about the schedules and getting them operational and in earnings by year-end 2013.
Ron? Those particular projects Devers-Colorado and Eldorado-Ivanpah we have no indications of them been delayed.
That said it is always possible to run into delays with regards to environmental concerns on those projects.
But at least for now we've got no anticipated change in DCR and Eldorado-Ivanpah.
And Michael just to add.
If you look in the capital expenditures on Page 22 2012 and 2013 are very heavy construction years.
And a big part of that is [indiscernible] DCR Eldorado-Ivanpah.
So those are why that we have such a peak in this year and it drops off a little bit in 2013 but still stays elevated.
Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> My question goes to SONGS.
You mentioned that there may be steps you'll have to take in the summer to ensure adequate power supplies in California bringing plants owned by others back into service for example.
Are any of those costs likely to be unrecoverable? Or do you anticipate that all of them will be recoverable under the GRC? It's not -- this is Ron Hugh.
It is not done through the GRC.
Our fuel and purchased power costs are reviewed annually through our ERA proceeding.
And all of the cost that we incur for SONGS being down will be subject to a reasonableness review and it's tough to predict at this time where that will go next year.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> Is that the point also of your disclosure on 19 that the steam generator replacement cost remains subject to CPUC review? Is that something to remind us that that's a reasonableness test as well? That is an additional reasonableness test.
We've really got 3 categories here fuel and purchased power cost which are the ERA proceeding.
We've got the steam generator replacement reasonableness application that we need to make for the capital and then there's our O&amp;M cost which we talked about earlier.
Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> Question on the kind of thinking on dealing with EMG.
As you've talked about all the issues that you resolved in the last 6 months the pieces I guess we still have the RPM auction piece left.
So it seems like there should be more certainty of the pieces of the company.
But there are certain things such as power prices in the future also things like what happens with bonus depreciation that are going to be hard to really know in making this decision.
So how if you're going to try and work this out do you mitigate the risk to shareholders that you'd make the wrong call on those things? Or how do you deal with -- there's no way you're going to know all these pieces.
Steve this is Ted.
I'm trying to be a little more serious.
I think you put your finger on obviously one of the big issues.
We are looking well into the future.
We're looking at what the potential cash flows are going to be.
Certainly if we're engaged in conversations with bondholders and the like they're going to be doing similar types of things.
So there's judgments that have to be made and there's no way to be assured that those things -- that you can make all those judgments perfectly.
The one part that I think is immutable is we are not going to be making additional capital contributions from EIX and EMG.
So it is a closed loop as far as we look at the cash flows.
Number two I think we see some ways in which cash can flow through the system more readily which presumably would have value for EMG and for bondholders.
And I'm sure that will be a big part of any kind of restructuring conversation with them.
Beyond that it's all the usual stuff.
If you could tell me exactly where gas prices are going to be and coal prices this is a pretty easy equation but nobody has that.
So we have to make those judgments as do the bondholders.
Our next question comes from Paul Fremont of Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I guess the first question that I have I guess relates to Midwest Gen.
Given the much lower level of output that you saw in the first quarter do you expect that to translate to the remaining 3 quarters? Or would you look at that more as sort of a one-time event in the first quarter? Paul this is Jim.
I think with the lower prices and given the economics I think we've seen some lower generation generally.
Now these are the ramping units for ComEd and it really depends on demand within ComEd.
And so we've seen it from a high end.
I think in years past we've been as high as in the low 30 terawatt hours and we've seen it trend down as prices have come down.
And it really just depends on what's happening economically throughout ComEd.
But I would wager that generation levels would be lower than historical levels that we've seen.
Pedro would you like to add anything? Yes.
The one thing that I would add is that I agree with what Jim said in terms of the perspective relative to prior years.
I think your question also went to did we expect that the first quarter gets reflected in terms of how the units generate throughout the later quarters? I think we had that overlay of probably -- more likely than not that it's lower than in prior years.
I would say that in the first quarter as Jim mentioned earlier we did have fairly unique things going on simultaneously some higher planned outages.
We had to adjust the effects of weather including the river temperature-related curtailments.
So to the extent that some of those things turn around in terms of the summer months those unique factors won't be there presumably in the summer that were there in the first quarter.
So I think the overall trend of lower than last year makes sense.
So it would be good to have Fisk and Crawford you're going to have to factor in the equation which would lower generation levels from historical levels certainly for a full year.
Our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to get to the Joliet 6 and Waukegan retrofit decision.
What's the key time variable I suppose the variable and then the timing of that variable that you need to see to decide that retrofit? And then I guess along those lines can you meet the Illinois CPS agreement without those units retrofitted? I think in one of the pages that we have in the deck it shows the timeframe Page 34 for those that are on this call.
It shows the timeframe under the CPS agreement where we need to comply.
And the Joliet station is further out.
And in our plans and what we've talked about based on what we believe is going to happen with CSAPR and what we believe is going to happen with MATS we believe that most of the expenditures has got to be completed by the 2015 timeframe in order to comply with both state and federal requirements.
So that's the key time area that we'll have the majority of all the decisions made.
Now if you look in our disclosures we try to divide the numbers between the larger units and the smaller units so we give you visibility in terms of the cost differences between the 2.
And we've added some additional information in the deck this quarter so you can break it down by plant so you can see what the cost would be.
Research Division</strong> Is there any reason that you would go forward with retrofits before 2015 on those 2 units? Pedro? Yes.
I think our approach all along has been in general to make sure that we are complying with the Illinois standard.
And within that frankly wait as long as reasonable in order to build more time to test the value of the options.
So I think as long as we are complying with the requirements you'd probably expect us to continue to find -- look for ways to extend that runway.
Our next question comes from David Frank of Catapult Capital.
Ted my question was pretty much in line with Steve's and it was about trying to gauge your comfort level given all the uncertainties that we face in the future for things like natural gas prices.
And so I guess is the strategy here just to maybe pick something really low? And if you can get an agreement on that you go ahead? And if not you don't.
Yes.
Well that gets into some of the judgments which I'd probably -- I would probably prefer at this point not to go into those.
I think the one other point that I might leave out there is one that I believe I made at the last call.
And that is I don't think we really have a lot of interest in having EMG kind of lurch from quarter-to-quarter here.
We need to I think really understand is there a viable plan for EMG that allows us to make the retrofits that are economically sensible to make reduce the debt in the order of $1 billion and have sufficient cash flow to refinance remaining debt.
So it's kind of right-size the leverage and make the capital commitments that we need to make under the CPS agreement.
We need to see a credible plan for that and we need to be able to assure ourselves that EMG is viable and able to meet those objectives.
Going quarter-to-quarter makes it increasingly difficult to manage the business manage it effectively and frankly I don't think really helps the value for EIX shareholders.
So that's really our objective is to try to get this thing resolved see a credible plan take the approach we've done with other parts of this.
We work cooperatively that's always the way we start and we work cooperatively to figure out if there is in fact a path and then make the decisions and move on from there.
Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.
I have a question about the utility believe it or not.
Now I'm wondering given that the rate case decision is getting delayed by so much how does it impact your CapEx schedule? Because you have ranges of CapEx even for this year.
Should we assume simply that you are spending at the low end of the CapEx range? Yes.
Angie this is Jim.
And I'll let Linda Sullivan jump in here for further detail.
We're purposely spending at a lower level because we just don't know what's going to occur.
And so that's probably a good assumption.
Now historically when we've gotten delays in receiving GRCs we watch about capital and O&amp;M.
And then so you may see times when you have -- the actual closings can lag with what you would normally expect if you've got the GRC on a timely basis.
But it's really over the 3-year period that's important for the plan.
And we would have a lower capital spending and we'd hope to over time at least over the 3-year period catch back up to what we thought was necessary especially in the distribution area because that's just spending for reliability.
We want to get those dollars spent.
That's the care and feeding of the overall system and you need to get those dollars spent to maintain your overall service reliability levels.
Anything else you want to add to it Linda? I would add Angie on the CPC GRC side for the first quarter we are spending at the 2011 run rate.
And then transmissions were about $75 million above where we were last year.
And then the special projects are treated differently from a rate case perspective as well.
Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Just a question on the April 20 cost of capital application.
In the application you proposed an equity ratio of 48%.
What was the rationale for not seeking a higher equity ratio say in the 52% range? There's been quite a bit of discussion in the state about that level.
Just curious as to how you all think about the capital structure question.
Yes.
There's a -- it's an art probably not as much as a science in terms of how we look at this.
Going back just from when we hit the height of the financial crisis we had access to the capital markets and were able to finance in really the depths of the ugly times.
And we feel that given the access to the capital markets that we've enjoyed at the current equity ratio that's sufficient for current needs.
Now that could change dependent upon how we view the overall business.
It could change on the amount of debt equivalency that we're facing because of all the contracts we enter into for fuel and purchased power.
There could be other factors that I'm not thinking of now.
But we have good access to capital markets under reasonable prices.
And I think if we were to bump up the equity ratio that would just add cost per customers that we don't think is a good trade-off.
Our next question comes from Terran Miller of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Two quick questions.
Jim on Page 8 when you talked about the potential offset for the $185 million payment does that mean that EIX will end up with an IOU from EME going forward? Is that how we're supposed to think about that? How about N-O? That's not going to happen.
So Terran just...
So it's a forgiveness? No no no.
I don't want to be flip on this because it's real important.
You plan and look and see what your taxable income is going to be.
And taxable income can change for a lot of different reasons.
So you can go up or down at the utility.
Edison Capital still has some impact on the overall tax position for the enterprise so it is constantly and monthly changing.
So we gave you a number back at the end of the year.
And as a result as you roll forward in time some of those numbers now are changing.
So we will just give you a view as we see it at the close of every quarter and we'll update it.
We won't get into every reason why it changed but we're just signaling that taxable income can change and can offset some of the actual payment that EMG would normally make.
Our next question comes from Ashar Khan of Visium.
Can I just ask on the slide why is the AFUDC lower? I thought it would be because CapEx was lower this quarter but you were saying you're spending at the same level as of last year.
Could you just amplify why the $0.03 lower AFUDC is? Yes this is Jim.
And if I mess it up I'll give it over to Linda.
When you have more short-term debt the way the calculation works it lowers your aggregate AFUDC rate which can lower earnings.
I'll have to prove it to you mathematically offline Ashar but that's the way it works.
We have more short-term debt balances year-over-year that's causing AFUDC earnings to change.
So if you want to have a further discussion why don't we call back later and we can take you through it? Our next question comes from Kit Konolige of Konolige Research.
Most of my questions have been answered.
Quick question.
If you have a view on the proposal to allow the inclusion of hydro as a renewable in California either what you're feeling is about the substance of that proposal or the likelihood of passage.
We'll have Ron Litzinger address that.
If hydro is included as a renewable that would certainly be a positive for us in meeting the RPS standard and the amount of investment we need to make in transmission.
Hydro is also much more flexible and reduces some of the pressure we would have on integration costs.
So we would view that as a positive.
So Kit just your sense for numbers.
We were at 21% RPS requirements at the end of 2011 and hydro can go up and down year-after-year because this is probably a low season last year was a high season.
And large hydro was about what did we say 6%? In 2010 it was about 6%.
So if you have 21% or plus or minus 6% you're getting up to the high-20s now.
Our next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Ted just to summarize and make sure I'm understanding the message on EMG and you've laid out a number of data points from your side.
But first off to be clear you had previously been talking about having your decision by the summertime this year.
And I wanted to confirm that is still the timeline.
And then secondly when you talk about EMG not lurching quarter-to-quarter being viable et cetera should we assume that when all of this is done and assuming you get what you want et cetera however we get there that EMG should be a profitable i.e.
positive earnings contributor for EIX in the current price environment that we are in? Is that what we should be thinking? I think we've typically made the statement that we need to be able to meet the capital requirements the retrofit capital requirements under the CPS agreement and more recently U.S.
EPA rules.
Number two that we can delever EMG.
We've typically used this number around $1 billion of debt.
And that the subsequent cash flows in the business would allow credit metrics such that we could refinance the remaining debt when it comes due.
So those are kind of the key markers which are not really earnings-related markers or if anything probably a little more related to EBITDA.
But that to us would really spell a stabilized business that's able to meet its obligations and have positive cash flow which I think ultimately translates into positive earnings.
The exact timing on all of those that's a little harder to predict at this point.
But those are the key markers that we've typically laid out there.
The conversations that we would have with all the other stakeholders they're going to come to the table with things that are important to them.
But those are the ones that kind of most on our mind.
Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> SCE can you refresh us? What is the base FERC-authorized ROE on transmission? What would you describe as your weighted average concerning the incentive that some of your projects have ROE? And when is the next filing or docket process where the base ROE could be up for revision? Okay.
Michael I'm going to have Linda Sullivan grapple with all those questions.
Michael this is Linda.
The base ROE that is currently in rates is 9.96% and then we add to that the Cal ISO incentive of 50 basis points and the project incentives where we get into a weighted ROE of 11.1%.
That's currently in rates that is subject to refund and settlement procedures.
And we are in that process right now.
Research Division</strong> And what's the docket schedule for the next review of -- or what's a likely docket schedule for the next review of the base level ROE? The next -- well we're in the current schedule with the settlement procedures where the next proceeding is expected in the June timeframe.
Your next question comes from Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.
Research Division</strong> Ted I wanted to come back to timing a little bit on EMG.
And I guess as we all remember sort of I guess just about 9 months ago you set that 6- to 12-month timeframe.
And as I think you just responded you're going to be pretty much on track there.
As we start and turn the page or maybe turn the chapter to what now is going to be a new timeline and I know there's as much uncertainty now as there was 9 months ago how do you see this playing out from a time perspective? I imagine the bondholders on the phone may have their own views of that.
But how do you see with the idea that the 2013s in June or so create sort of their own ending if you will as far as the process? Well certainly the maturity in middle of next year is something of a forcing function.
But our intent is not to wait until June of next year.
So the 6- to 12-month kind of marker that I put out there last summer I think still represents pretty much the right timing.
So we've been getting more and more information.
And as we've gotten that information we've made some decisions such as the Fisk and Crawford decisions which clarify a little bit what some of the CapEx requirements are going to be.
In a few weeks here we'll hear where we are on the capacity prices which I think will be important when you look at those in the context of last year's auction.
So I think we're pretty much on the schedule that I mentioned and most of the information that's relevant to making important decisions for us as well as for the bondholders other stakeholders I think most of that information is either on the table or about ready to hit the table.
Our next question comes from Jason Mandel of RBC Capital Markets.
Just 2 quick questions.
First off on Capistrano Wind just so I understand the dollars in and dollars out there's some timing issues with when money gets paid and gets spent and whether or not there would potentially be any impact to those dollars from a restructuring event at EME.
And the second one just basically on the capacity auction and plants that are being bid in and process-wise how that works in the event that the capital spending is either not there or doesn't make any sense in the future and basically can't be met.
Well let me take it in reverse order.
This is Jim.
And then I'll look over to the EMG folks for a little help on Capistrano numbers.
But we'll anticipate bidding in our plants on a normal course and we're working down that path now.
And I'll stop there because I think we gave you the key message.
And Maria and Pedro on Capistrano the ins and outs.
On Capistrano the investors paid $230 million for the 3 operating projects that have been now become part of Capistrano.
Subsequently there are 2 construction projects that will at COD and conversion from construction financing to term financing be contributed down into Capistrano.
At that point in time there's another $140 million earmarked which will reimburse CME for any equity contributions.
As Jim noted earlier those projects have been also project-financed and the debt on those projects will go towards the balance of the construction costs.
Your next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.
I actually had a question about San Onofre.
We see some indications that San Onofre 2 is supposed to be back online on June 2 -- well 1 actually and then the Unit 3 back on June 12.
But I understand that the NRC needs to voice its approval for the units to come back.
I mean could you talk us through the process and how likely this NRC will be comfortable with the solutions that you're presenting them with? Angie we're going to have Ron take you through that.
I believe you're looking at what we've posted with the California ISO on the returns to service.
And we update that periodically.
We are currently as Ted mentioned evaluating the causal analysis and where we might go with the -- responding to the Confirmatory Action Letter.
But we will likely update those numbers within the next couple of weeks with CAISO that are officially posted.
Our next question comes from Terran Miller of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Second question is Jim EM -- Capistrano does that sit at EMG? Or does that sit at EME? And second question is the $98 million of proceeds from the project financing is that cash available to EME? Or does that go with the project? It sounds like in the last time it goes with the project to complete the project.
On the latter one yes.
Maria? In terms of the ownership structure? Yes.
So Capistrano is indirectly owned by EME.
Indirectly owned by EME.
Correct.
Our next question comes from [indiscernible] of JPMorgan.
So the 2013 notes mature obviously a year from now but the Midwest Gen credit facility expires next month.
What are your plans with regard to that? The Midwest Gen revolver we've said in the disclosures that in fact there is hardly any usage on it and it will likely just expire on time.
And so we have plenty of cash currently at this time at EME and we'll use that cash really to take care of our working capital requirements.
And we don't at this point in time have a plan in place to put any kind of replacement revolver.
And part of the big picture here is working to figure out how we're to work with the bondholders before we have the maturity that coming up.
Now the disclosures do show that we have -- thank you Scott -- an LC facility in place a cash-collateralized LC facility to take care of some of the requirements we have with the things that go on admission to back up the trading shop and other requirements.
And then we've disclosed that in terms of the usage in our current quarterly report.
The last question comes from Raymond Leung of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just following up on -- just questions about flowing of cash.
But related to Walnut Creek have you guys made the entire equity contribution? If not how much more do you need to put out there and over what timeframe? Yes.
The equity went in first and now we're drawing down on the facility to cover the construction expenditures Ray.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So you're done funding that.
That wouldn't be another cash drain.
Correct.
That is the last question.
And I will now turn the call back to you Mr.
Cunningham.
Go ahead.
Great.
Thanks very much everyone for joining us.
And please don't hesitate to call us at Investor Relations if you have any follow-up questions.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
This concludes today's conference.
Thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Good afternoon.
My name is Gabrielle and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Second Quarter 2012 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks Gabrielle and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our 10-Q filings are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
Tomorrow afternoon we'll issue our regular quarterly business update presentation that will use these and other slides for ongoing investor discussions.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
When we get to Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
If you have further questions please return to the queue.
With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Today Edison International reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.23 per share and core earnings of $0.32 per share.
As expected this was below last year's $0.54 per share in GAAP earnings and $0.56 per share in core earnings.
Second quarter results reflect unrecovered cost at Southern California Edison due to the delayed General Rate Case decision.
In addition we have continued inspection and repair costs related to the outage at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
SCE will look to recover these costs in the future.
We also saw additional losses at EMG this quarter primarily reflecting low power prices.
This further underscores the need to restructure and stabilize our competitive generation business as I'll talk about in a few minutes.
There are several important developments at Southern California Edison this quarter.
I'll spend most of my time on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station or SONGS as we call it.
Both units at SONGS remained safely shut down for inspections analysis and testing following the January 31 Unit 3 steam generator tube leak.
SCE has retained several outside industry experts consultants and steam generator manufacturers in addition to heavy -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries which designed and manufactured our steam generators to analyze the causes of the unique tube-to-tube wear and potential remedial actions.
On July 19 the NRC released its detailed findings from its augmented inspection team.
It summarized its finding by saying that faulty computer modeling inadequately predicted conditions in the steam generators and manufacturing issues contributed to excessive wear of the components.
The report states that the excessive wear arose from tube-to-tube contact caused by vibration in the tubes in certain areas of the steam generators.
The excessive vibration is due to a phenomenon called fluid elastic instability which is discussed in detail in the report.
The NRC has identified a number of outstanding issues that it still is reviewing.
To date the inspection and repair effort is focused on a substantial amount of technical analysis work and preventative plugging of tubes where appropriate based on indications of prior or potential future wear both in areas where there was tube-to-tube contact and tube-to-support contact.
Each of the 4 steam generators has over 9 700 heat-transfer tubes and is designed to include sufficient tubes to accommodate a need to remove some from service for a variety of reasons and the tubes at SCE has preventively removed from service are all well within this margin.
SONGS will not be restarted until SEC determines that it is safe to do so.
And when startup has been approved by the NRC pursuant to the terms of a Confirmatory Action Letter.
Any remedial action that will permit restart of one or both of the units will need to ensure that the fluid elastic instability phenomenon does not reoccur.
Because Unit 2 experienced considerably less tube-to-tube wear it could restart months in advance of Unit 3.
Any restart of Unit 2 would likely operate at reduced power levels and with mid-cycle scheduled outages to provide for additional inspection and testing to assure safe operation.
Inasmuch as Unit 3 had more tube-to-tube wear than Unit 2 it is not at this time whether Unit 3 will be able to restart without extensive additional repairs.
SCE is also looking longer term at what repairs if any could allow the steam generators to operate safely at full power as originally specified.
At this time SCE has not determined what those repairs might be or whether the generators will need to be replaced for the units to operate at full output.
In the interim SCE is reviewing its O&amp;M and capital expenditures at SONGS with a view to reducing expenditures to mitigate the added cost pressures from both units being out of service.
I'd like to clear up some confusion that has arisen in the past regarding potential dates for submitting our response to the Confirmatory Action Letter.
We have never released a specific date for our submittal.
Under the California Independent System Operator rules we are required to post an estimated restart date on their website whenever we have a generating unit down for an outage.
But these are only rough estimates and not formal forecast timelines.
We will not be forecasting specific timelines for a Confirmatory Action Letter submittal or potential startup dates.
As we have said many times there is no timeline for safety.
And to forecast dates is inconsistent with prudent decision-making.
Turning to the regulatory review at the state level there are several mechanisms in place for the California Public Utilities Commission to provide oversight and review the reasonableness of expenditures related to the outage.
First the steam generator project cost remains subject to a CPUC reasonableness review once SCE submits final cost for the project.
As of June 30 SCE has spent $593 million on the project compared to the inflation-adjusted authorized spend of $665 million or SCE's 78% ownership share.
Second our purchase to replace SONGS generation is recoverable through the ERRA E-R-R-A balancing account which is also subject to an annual reasonableness review.
Third the California Public Utilities Code has rules governing outages.
Once either of the units has been out of service for 9 consecutive months which should be November 2012 for Unit 3 and December 2012 for Unit 2 SCE is required to notify the CPUC.
Within 45 days the CPUC is required to initiate a review to determine whether to remove from customer rates all or part of the revenue requirement associated with what's out of service.
Any rate adjustment is made after hearings conducted as part of future General Rate Cases.
In addition the CPUC's pending proposal to initiate an order instituting an investigation regarding the impact of the extended outage is scheduled for consideration at their Thursday meeting.
Jim will cover the financial impacts and recovery of costs incurred in his comments.
My remaining SEC comments will be brief.
We still have no indication of the timeline for receiving a General Rate Case proposed decision but are hopeful this can be concluded in the third quarter.
We recognize the significant workload on the commission and staff at this time but remain hopeful that we can soon gain the clarity we need to run the utility efficiently.
Turning to Edison Mission Energy we remain focused on developing clarity on the best approach for financially stabilizing EME.
There has been continued progress this year across several self-help initiatives to improve liquidity and operating cash flow.
One was to accelerate the closing of uneconomic plants and transferring Homer City to the owner-lessors.
Another has been to reduce operating and overhead costs to the extent possible including another workforce reduction to be completed by the end of 2012.
A third is minimizing capital spending on environmental retrofits while complying with all state and federal emissions loss.
However our greatest focus has been on the need to restructure the $3.7 billion of unsecured debt.
This is because despite EME's efforts at managing liquidity our internal forecast anticipate that EME's liquidity will rapidly decline in future quarters and absent a restructuring of its obligations EME will not have sufficient liquidity to repay the $500 million in unsecured debt due in June 2013.
For EME to be viable it must have a clear path to adequate liquidity particularly over the near-term when it will have the cash cost of retrofits and the tightest operating cash flows.
A successful restructuring will require at least 2 things.
First it will require a reduction of debts sufficient to obtain credit metrics that will enable EME to access capital markets to refinance remaining debt well in advance of future maturities based on a reasonable set of assumptions.
Second it will require conserving cash wherever possible especially over the next couple of years during the retrofit period and the severe trough and capacity payments to provide a margin of safety in a continuing uncertain market.
Given the fact that EME and Midwest Generation are intertwined this may result in the need for revisions in Midwest generation's Powerton and Joliet leverage lease financings as well.
EME and Edison International are engaging on a confidential basis with advisors representing certain of EME's unsecured bondholders to discuss EME's financial condition.
Should we be unsuccessful in negotiating a debt restructuring adequate to stabilize EME as part of Edison International and in accordance with the requirements I just outlined then EME would need to be reorganized under new ownership.
Our objectives remain the same: eliminate the overhang of uncertainty about EME restore EME to a healthy financial condition that would position it for future success and act with a purpose and a sense of urgency.
While the exact path forward to success is not clear at this point we are engaged with bondholders and we plan on moving our discussions along as rapidly as we can.
Despite some of the challenges that I've touched on when I step back the investment thesis in Edison International is very much intact.
I'm optimistic that we can resolve some important issues this year.
At SCE we continue to have a sustained need for capital investment and system reliability and meeting public policy mandates with the potential for sustained mid to high single-digit rate base growth.
Finally as we move beyond SCE's 2012 capital spending peak and get the rate case and cost of capital decisions we will seek to return our dividend in steps over the subsequent years to our target payout ratio range of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings.
The earnings power at SCE along with gaining clarity on EME provide the key value drivers for Edison International shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thanks Ted.
Good afternoon everyone.
Please turn to Page 2 which summarizes the quarter's results that Ted just touched on.
I will not duplicate Ted's comments but will add one note that EIX parent company costs were unchanged quarter-over-quarter.
Page 3 highlights the key drivers of SCE's earnings.
As in the first quarter CPUC revenues were largely based on 2011 authorized revenues.
As a result higher costs are now currently being recovered including higher depreciation and new debt and preferred stock costs.
This impact totaled $0.09 per share.
When SCE receives its final General Rate Case decision it will record the authorized revenues retroactively to January 1.
During the second quarter inspection and repair costs related to the San Onofre outage reduced earnings by $0.05 per share.
These costs were offset by timing differences and other cost savings which amounted to $0.08 per share.
As many of you are aware on June 15 the CPUC set the schedule and the approach for the 2013 cost of capital proceeding for SCE and the other major California utilities.
The commission has separated the case into 2 phases the first addressing the allowed returns and capital structure which will be decided in December and a second phase to review the cost of capital trigger mechanism that has been in place since 2007.
SCE did not propose any changes to the existing trigger mechanism except to reset the starting point of the index to the period ending September 2012.
We would expect the Moody's BAA Utility Bond Index to continue to be the appropriate index for SCE based on its current credit ratings.
Please turn to Page 4.
I'd like to pick up on Ted's discussion on SONGS with some more color on cost in our current investment.
Year-to-date SCE's share of the pretax cost of SONGS-related inspection and repairs totaled $48 million.
It was $20 million during Q1 and $28 million during Q2.
As a reminder we continue to flow these costs through core earnings.
You may recall that last quarter we estimated that SCE's share of the total incremental inspection and repair cost associated with returning both units to service was then projected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million pretax we now believe that SCE's share of incremental costs to commence startup of just Unit 2 at the reduced power levels that Ted outlined previously is expected to be approximately $25 million pretax.
Of course this estimate remains subject to NRC review and any new development that result from further analysis and testing.
Based on additional knowledge gained regarding Unit 3 over the past 3 months we've concluded it's premature to estimate the incremental repair costs associated with returning this unit to service.
We are also evaluating the cost while returning both units to full capacity.
The market cost for substitute energy and capacity net of avoided nuclear fuel for SONGS are being recorded in the fuel and purchased power balancing account with no impact on earnings.
As of June 30 these costs which were subject to CPUC reasonableness review totaled $117 million.
Because of the uncertainties associated with when and at what levels the units will or may return to service total potential substitute power cost cannot be estimated at this time.
The slide on Page 4 also summarizes key financial metrics related to SONGS.
SCE requested annual revenue requirement of approximately $650 million in its 2012 General Rate Case to cover direct operation and maintenance cost depreciation and return on investment.
SONGS rate base at the end of the second quarter was $1.2 billion.
Please turn to Page 5.
As Ted indicated at this time our focus remains on the technical analysis to return the units to service safely although we are assessing all available remedies for cost recovery.
Steam generators are warranted for an initial period of 20 years from acceptance.
The manufacturer is contractually obligated to repair or replace defective items and to pay specified damages for certain repairs with stated liability under the purchase agreement limited to $137 million.
These limitations are subject to applicable exceptions.
There may also be potential recoveries under insurance issued by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited known as NEIL and we have placed NEIL on notice of potential claims although insurance recoveries remain uncertain.
I'd like to come back to the rate case decision timing and the impacts on SCE's capital spending plan.
Please turn to Page 6.
SCE has not changed its capital spending forecast pending a final rate case decision.
However the GRC delay will likely change the 3-year forecast of actual spending which depending upon the final timing could bring 2012 capital spending at or below the low end of the forecast range.
Actual capital spending will likely catch up with CPUC authorized spending in the later years of the 3-year rate case cycle.
This timing mismatch will primarily affect distribution and generation CapEx.
Please turn to Page 7 which covers EMG's results.
Keep in mind these results almost entirely reflect the activities of EME.
We continue to wind down Edison Capital and its ongoing earnings are immaterial.
As we told you last quarter Homer City is reported in non-core earnings in both periods.
Midwest Generation continues to face weak power markets and higher delivered coal cost resulting in $0.08 per share higher loss.
EMMT's trading results were down $0.02 per share.
Results also reflect a $0.02 per share decrease related to certain wind projects that are consolidated in EMG's results.
This relates largely to the Capistrano Wind Partners transaction completed in February.
While the transaction provided an important source of liquidity to EME it effectively lowered EME's ownership interest and therefore share of earnings.
Comparisons were also impacted by lower distributions from the Doga project which largely cost $0.03 per share reduction from the natural gas power fleet.
EMG's EBITDA was $9 million in the quarter and $50 million year-to-date.
Our usual supplemental information on EMG's EBITDA capital spending and operating hedge summaries as well as year-to-date financial results are included in the presentation appendix.
Please turn to Page 8 and we'll review liquidity.
As of June 30 EME and its subsidiaries had slightly over $1 billion of cash and short-term investments.
Cash and cash equivalents not subject to contractual dividend restrictions were $879 million which includes $177 million of Midwest Gen cash.
With the June 29 expiration of the Midwest Generation credit facility the contractual dividend restriction on movement of cash under this agreement is now eliminated.
As a side note EME's environmental retrofit plan is essentially unchanged from last quarter although EME continues to look for opportunities to optimize spending while remaining in compliance with applicable state and federal rules.
EME's deferred tax asset remains an important source of future liquidity under an intercompany tax allocation agreement.
These tax assets increased modestly to $961 million as of June 30 from $908 million in the first quarter.
Future payments under the tax allocation agreement are only available to EME if it remains part of the consolidated Edison International tax filing entity which requires EIX ownership of at least 80% of EME.
A final point on liquidity is that SCE and EIX replaced their credit facilities during the second quarter.
More details are included in our disclosures.
Page 9 is a summary of EME's financial status which Ted has substantially addressed and is included in EME and EIX disclosures.
Lastly Page 10 of the presentation highlights some of the key operating variables consistent with what we have introduced last quarter.
As we have said previously we will not provide earnings guidance until after we receive a final rate case decision.
With that I'd like to turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&amp;A portion of the call.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question does come from Dan Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Ted I was wondering if you could just share a little more thought on the EME situation.
Clearly the case is being made for liquidity and survivability of the business but how do you put this decision in context of your preserving equity value for shareholders demonstrators ongoing equity value above just kind of going entity concern? Yes it's a great question.
And I think at this point like most decisions of the sort it's going to be a matter of relative value.
Generically there going to be 2 choices.
Either EME will make sense as a continuing part of the EIX family and I've tried to be clear over the last few earnings calls about kind of the markers that we have in mind that would really provide us and our equity investors sufficient clarity around the viability of EME as part of EIX.
If we're unable to really gain that clarity or unable to really see a viable entity that ultimately can return to providing value to EIX delivering on its underlying mission then it really won't make sense to be part of Edison International and will need to be owned by others.
So at this point it's too early to tell really what's the art of the possible where as I mentioned we're beginning the process of engaging with bondholders to determine that.
And we get sufficient clarity get sufficient certainty and we can really see a path for EME to be a value-adding part of EIX then that's the way we'll go.
If not then it's not going to be part of EIX.
Research Division</strong> And I know it's -- the negotiations are starting now but is there a time line that you guys have set kind of as to how quickly you want to have this resolved or how long it will take to get to clarity? Yes I mean we chose the words carefully in my opening comments trying to indicate that the time is now.
I mean we need to engage we need to get these conversations going.
We're doing it with a sense of purpose and a sense of urgency and we want to resolve this.
The uncertainty I don't think is doing anybody any good.
I don't think it's doing EIX equity holders any good I don't think it's doing EME any good.
We've got important operations.
We have safety that we have to have in mind.
All of these things I think really say we need to reach a conclusion here with dispatch.
And our next question does come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Yes couple of questions.
First on Mission I know you've talked about not having liquidity to meet the $500 million maturity next year.
But you've got some decent-sized bond payments coming toward the back end of this year I think late in the fall.
Just curious are those bond payments kind of the trigger date we should think about? Meaning that you kind of want to make a decision before those payment date show up or is it something that could go into next year? Mike it's Ted.
Short answer is yes.
I think those interest payments are very important and even waiting out until November when those interest payments are dues in my mind not moving with dispatch.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And you've talked a number of times over the last 6 to 12 months about wanting EIX to have competitive generation meaning not wanting solely to be a regulated utility holding company.
Just curious if it comes to that how -- and that merchant generation company is not Edison Mission how would you get it off the ground? How would you get started? Yes maybe I'll -- sorry this is Ted again.
Maybe I'll just reshape your words a little bit here.
I think what we've stated in the past is we believe that it's important to have both a regulated and competitive business platform.
Competitive generation in my mind is a subset of a competitive business platform so just one clarification on that point.
I think in general we'd have to admit that it seems like the potential for distributed generation or more retail-related services or even other competitive business activities that would be outside of our regulated footprint at Southern California Edison but those are more futuristic.
We think there's some important opportunities that we want to continue to track and continue to focus some attention on.
But it would be better I think to make use of some existing skills and an existing platform than to create those from scratch from whole cloth.
But that's probably an advantage on the margin and I don't think it's one that really drives our thinking at this point.
And our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> I had a quick question on -- so the $48 million that you incurred so far at SONGS can you give us an idea of how much of that was Unit 2 and how much was Unit 3 versus I guess the $25 million future spend that you've marked for getting Unit 2 back for reduced power? No I don't have a breakdown here.
We haven't disclosed the breakout between the 2 separate units Jonathan.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Is there anything else you can do for us to sort of try and frame what your -- the terminology I think you used extensive as the possible additional repair work that might be needed on Unit 3 could mean at this exit of multiples of Unit 2 or just moderately more.
Anything you can -- any additional framing you can put on that? Jonathan this is Ted.
Just a quick part on that.
I think the main thing we're really trying to signal there is you -- we probably can't address entirely the issue of keeping this phenomena this fluid elastic instability phenomenon from reocurring by simply operating at reduced power in the case of Unit 3.
So what we're really trying to signal is it needs more than reduced power types of operations.
So that's really what we're referring to.
We haven't gone far enough down the road at this point with Unit 3 to really come up with anything more definitive than that in terms of exactly what would be required to restore it.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Can I just try one other thing on this topic Ted is there any when you -- as you analyze these scenarios around what's the best deal for customers or the costs you're looking at is there any question that fixing it is the right option? Well I think at this stage you'd expect us to have all the options on the table.
At this juncture we're just trying to do this in the most disciplined systematic kind of step-by-step approach.
And these are complex technical issues.
It's a first-of-a-kind type of issue that we're dealing with meaning this tube-to-tube wear.
So we're just taking it one step at a time without trying to get too far ahead of ourselves.
But yes at this point of course all options are on the table.
We're focused mostly on getting Unit 2 restored if we believe we can do it safely.
And as we said it's pretty clear to us initially that would be at reduced power with relatively short operating windows that we take it down and go through reinspections and all of that will help inform us in terms of our future actions as well.
And our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I guess 2 questions.
One you talked about a targeted payout of 45% to 55% if Mission were no longer -- if Mission were to file for bankruptcy.
Should we assume that you'd be targeting the same level of payout or would that potentially change? Paul it's Jim.
We based the dividend for EIX on the earnings of the utility.
That's the way we've always done it.
So I don't foresee that any action in and around EME would affect our payout policy.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then the second question that I have is if EMG were to file could you give us a sense of how we should think about the $961 million of tax benefit that sits there? Is there any precedent in other filings as to what would happen? Would EIX be forced to repurchase that or how should we think about it? I think -- this is Jim again Paul.
I think that's a complicated issue and it would be certainly embroiled in any kind of negotiation with bondholders or during the bankruptcy process.
I don't think we can predict at this point in time what ultimately would occur.
It's clear that as long as EME is part of a consolidated family and that might be during the period of a bankruptcy then we'd have to monetize tax benefits.
But ultimately where it plays out in the end that's harder to say.
So there would be a point in time when ultimately the clock could stop ticking and you would cut off ultimately the monetization of tax benefits.
But that will take a lot to get resolved and it could take a period of time.
I couldn't predict at this point in time how long.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And are there any precedents that we could look at in terms of other companies where this has been ruled on? Yes I think the only one that comes to mind from when we previously saw this and it's going to be dated.
So there was some discussion around the PG&amp;E bankruptcy when they -- when their competitive generation business went into bankruptcy.
But again remember that was back in 2001 2002 so I'd be careful looking at that precedent and given the passage of time.
And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> A couple just logistical questions on the SONGS.
Is there a way to break out the rate base between Units 2 and Unit 3? At this point in time it's not -- we haven't provided it.
And so again in future filings we may have to do that.
But at this point in time I think that's something for the future Steve.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then also on the comments you made on the rate base related to the GRC and that -- for '12 you'll probably be at the low end or below on your CapEx.
The CapEx yes.
Research Division</strong> Yes.
But then just to clarify you expect to make up for most of that in '13 '14 so that imply that the '13 '14 could be toward the upper or above the upper end so that it's kind of equal over the 3 years? Well yes.
And -- so that's exactly what would occur.
We've had this pattern before when you get a late GRC that your actual capital expenditures will differ than authorized.
And so actual capital expenditures will lag and they'll go above.
But remember on a rate making basis we get paid.
And our revenues are based on authorized.
So we're just trying to draw attention to that phenomena.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I guess one last question on the Edison Mission situation.
I think at times it's been talked about the potential that if you do and if it does end up going under different ownership that there could be this worthless stock deduction.
Could you just comment on whether that would be likely and at what point in time would that potentially be deducted so to speak? We haven't put in a public domain what if any worthless stock deduction there'd be.
And it's always taken at the conclusion of a bankruptcy process.
And the fact that there is a worthless stock deduction could get dragged into the negotiations in some type of bankruptcy proceeding.
So I couldn't even begin to tell you what the bread basket is.
And there's a number that changes constantly each quarter based on the earnings or losses and the monetization of tax benefits can change the worthless stock deduction.
So it's constantly changing so we've been taking a position not to put it into the domain until we actually get further down the road.
And our next question does come from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Ted coming back to your thoughts on EMG and what you've seen as the viable entity stable entity going forward.
Assuming it doesn't file for bankruptcy and you get what you're looking for through this restructuring how should we be thinking about the underlying earnings or positive earnings power of that entity? Should we think that coming out of bankruptcy this is a profitable entity from an earnings perspective or should we think that this is really driven by these capacity payments and forward curves maybe profitability is a couple of years out? How should we think about that as part of the equity value proposition if you do stick with EMG? That's a good -- great question.
Unfortunately I don't have a great answer.
Certainly it will depend on what power prices and capacity prices will be.
We've got a little more clarity on the capacity price side than we do on the power price side as we go forward.
But that's really going to be the determinant.
I would have to say based on kind of current pricing and that type of stuff I don't know that we would expect to see anything close to robust earnings in the subsequent years.
But frankly kind of throwing darts here at this point it will depend on what comes out of any negotiation and it'll certainly depend heavily on what the actual prices are once it come out of the restructuring process.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And second question just coming back to SONGS again.
Bigger picture issue there I mean the first quarter when you guys laid out your -- what is going on there the expectation at least was that the cost that you were incurring you were very confident you would basically recoup those either through warranty payments or regulatory process.
And I just want to be clear is that still your view right now and how should we think about the points you make about the amount that are in your current GRC the rate base I mean is that a scenario unfolding that the commission takes out SONGS from rate base and from customer rates and has that could be bad negative earnings implications to think about from our end? Again 2 for 2 2 great questions and I'm going to be 2 for 2 not 2 great answers.
I don't think we really know at this point.
What we try to do in the discussion here is outline what the proceedings were what we can anticipate roughly in terms of the timing of those proceedings and what -- which costs or what cost will be part of those proceedings.
That's about as definitive as we can be at this point in time.
Not the least of which we don't yet really know ourselves what the potential fixes or outcomes are for the 2 units.
So I'd say at this point there's more that we don't know than we do around what those specific numbers would look like.
And our next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> Two questions.
One just on Jim on the comments you made relative to capital expenditures relative to projected rate base growth.
So presuming that you get a General Rate Case decision that validates the CapEx plan and the rate base growth profile that you project in these slides what you're basically telling us is that you would book your revenue requirement as if you were spending on plan but the cash flow profile actual be slightly more middle to back-end loaded on the actual expenditures so that on a GAAP basis we might actually see slightly higher earned ROE in the front and then it smooths out towards the end is that right? I think you hit it completely on -- nail in the head.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
Second question am I correct that this is the first time that you talked with investors explicitly about making a NEIL filing for insurance recovery? And can we talk about the process there and what you think you're covered for? It is the first time.
We've always had insurance from NEIL.
That's something that all the facilities it's a mutual.
And in terms of the process we haven't provided any additional information on what that will be.
That will unfold over time and as we actually make the claims and we'll include it in future disclosures around San Onofre.
Research Division</strong> But are you expecting to file for outage insurance as well as for the cost of repair? The -- just when I go back -- the way it works to just -- for further clarification for -- there's a period of time there's a deductible and the disclosures get into more detail on this.
You have to read it carefully Greg.
There's a period of time when we cannot recover replacement power then it kicks in and there are certain limitations associated with it.
And there are certain limitations on it there's 1 or 2 units out.
So read that carefully and I think it's pretty clear in there limits on a total amount of insurance that we could ultimately recover from an outage.
And I'm going to go back and pause again and let you reask your question because I wanted to fill in that GAAP piece.
Research Division</strong> Right.
Well just about here on Page 5 of your deck that you have the 12-week deductible period? Yes.
Research Division</strong> And then after that you could file for outage from damage.
So -- and then you also have accidental property damage.
I guess my question is whether you're going to file for accidental property damage outage or both? I could -- yes is the answer.
And our next question comes from Kit Konolige with BGC Financial.
Ted question back to your discussion of the dividend.
I wrote down the notes here that we have some challenges but we're optimistic I guess to the effect of after we resolve the challenges then we'll look to grow the dividend again.
Can you be more specific about what has to be overcome before the dividend starts to grow at this more robust rate? More specific.
Well maybe just to reiterate what I said is we see 2012 as basically being around the peak of the capital spending at SCE.
We've talked a little bit in some of the comments that Jim made as well as the Q&amp;A up to this point that the exact shape of that is a little tricky to completely predict.
But I still think the basic point stands that we're probably close to the peak in capital spending in 2012.
So while rate base will continue to grow in subsequent years it's growing at a decreasing rate.
And that phenomenon in utility rate-making causes a kind of a kind of a -- I'd refer to it as a bow wave of cash that builds up.
So I think that certainly starts to set up the conditions for being able to look at moving our dividend back into the targeted payout ratio range which is based on SCE earnings entirely.
So we've fallen out the bottom of that range.
And so in a kind of a step-by-step manner we would expect to try to address that to move it back up towards the targeted payout ratio range.
We have indicated that we have some important regulatory decisions right in front of us here this year namely a rate case and the cost to capital decision.
I mean both of those remain outstanding.
So we certainly would need to get decisions on those 2 things to really know what we're looking at in the near term around the dividend.
But I think the direction is the way we've stated it here in the last several earnings calls that we see the day where we can start tuning up the dividend payout and move it back towards our payout target ratio.
And just to follow on that are you at a stage now with SONGS where you'd feel that that needs more clarity or some kind of resolution before the next stage of the dividend is addressed? Or would that just be taken in stride? Well I think it would be a consideration but the types of things I'm talking about here are fairly long-term and directional.
So it'll be -- like other issues it'll be things that you certainly taken into account when you're trying to set a responsible dividend and follow our financial disciplines.
But I think it's -- take it in stride I guess is more in the neighborhood.
And our next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> I know that you can't predict how the CPUC is going to respond to the SONGS outage.
But I was hoping you might be able to reiterate the schedule on which the CPUC would make its determination and perhaps give us a little bit of guidance as to the degree of discretion that they have in making their decisions.
So you had mentioned that after 9 months of outage you have to notify them.
Can you take us from there as to what the steps are on the regulatory counter? Yes I'm actually going to probably turn it over to the folks who are a little closer to all those specifics but we've tried to identify the 3 main proceedings that will have some impact on cost recovery around San Onofre.
But Ron you want to pick that up? Yes.
Hugh this is Ron.
With regards to PUC Section 455.5 when we've been out of service for 9 months we would have to notify the commission on Unit 3 in November.
They have 45 days to respond that will look at our revenue requirements and focus on the O&amp;M costs.
The reasonableness review if the commission elects to do it on the steam generator replacement project that would be initiated when we complete the project.
We currently estimate that we'll complete the disposal later this year of the units and that would be the trigger for that.
And then the ERRA proceeding that will be April of next year.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So on the first proceeding the Section 455.5 what is being reviewed there is simply the direct O&amp;M or the recovery of depreciation and return on investment as well on the unit.
The rate base -- the depreciation and recovery it's basically a review of the rate base which would include your O&amp;M and then your depreciation and return.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> Right.
So we're basically looking at possibly half of the $650 million that you estimate here as the annual revenue requirement? They would review the whole revenue requirement based on the conditions that we have at the time.
And our next question comes from Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.
Research Division</strong> Maybe just finishing on that last one with Ron.
If they do elect to start an OII this Thursday would that section 455.5 proceeding be sort of set into that or are these just would be 2 separate proceedings? I think the short answer is at this point we don't know.
I think there's some benefit -- I'm stating an opinion here.
I think there'd be some benefit to have some of these things consolidated instead of having multiple proceedings.
But anyway presumably that's what the commission will consider later this week.
But we really can't predict how all that would flow out at this point.
And just for clarification purposes if you get into a 455.5 situation it's on a unit-by-unit basis.
So they're looking at the revenue requirement for each unit.
So if SONGS 2 were to come back up SONGS 3 stays down then you could actually have a separate proceeding for Unit 3.
Research Division</strong> Got you okay.
No that's great.
And then Ted maybe going back to EMG and I apologize in advance for doing this to you I think I heard you respond in a earlier question that you sort of sounded like November was too late to respond.
And I think at earlier conference calls you had maybe the word committed is too strong but suggested that an answer might or should be given by September.
Just using the clock the 6 to 12-months clock you started a year ago in September.
Is September too aggressive to assume that we'd have an answer by then given the complexities of the situation and where we stand now on July 31? Again I really don't know.
Now we're kind of getting into the fine cutting on the days.
But from my perspective you can make these things drag on forever and ever and complicate the heck out of them.
I think it's actually you're going to end up being reasonably straightforward about what will be sufficient to have a viable entity on a go-forward basis.
And if we can't reach that then we go to other options.
So from my standpoint sooner is better.
I think the data is being made available.
We ought to be able to sit down and work through the same figure out if we've got a good mutual approach that works for all parties.
Research Division</strong> Got you.
So something like November is probably the right sort of time frame to think about understanding it's rough and sort of mirroring your response to another question.
Well since I'll probably only get in trouble by trying to predict dates I'll just let you -- I'll let you work with your dates.
But we're focused on it right now.
And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Two questions.
First when you cut your parent cost how much of the parent cost is being now covered by EMG? So in other words if EMG were to cease to exist how much of an incremental expense should I account for when I look at the parent and utility earnings? Angie that's an excellent question.
We haven't put anything out in the public domain.
There would certainly be some amount of cost that we allocate to that side that would not be potentially recoverable if we went down the road that way.
But that would be -- we'll incorporate it in some kind of future disclosures.
But we don't have anything now.
But can you give us any sense? Is this $0.50 or this a de minimis amount? I think it's a relatively small amount.
Because we've said already that the holding company cost is about a $0.01 a month or 12 -- we've as -- generally we've indicated it's about $0.12 a year.
So it's not a large amount of money when it's all said and done.
Okay.
And the second question is about the NEIL recovery.
It seems like there's so many companies seeking recovery from NEIL.
Should we worry that NEIL is going to run out of its capacity to actually provide the insurance coverage? I don't know if I can answer that.
NEIL's been around for quite a bit -- long period of time.
It's a mutual there are quite a bit of reserves associated with it.
There's mechanisms for them to get out and get additional funds should you exceed certain calls in their capital.
So I think that's a question you can direct to NEIL but I don't think it's their concern at this point in time.
And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session.
I will now turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone for participating and don't hesitate to call us at Investor Relations if you have any follow-ups.
Thank you.
And that does conclude today's conference.
Thank you very much for your participation.
You may disconnect at this time.
Good afternoon.
My name is Gabrielle and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Third Quarter 2012 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks so much and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our SEC filings are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
We will be using these and other slides in our regular quarterly business update presentation that will be issued next week for our ongoing investor discussion.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We urge you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
When we get to Q&amp;A please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up.
If you have further questions please return to the queue.
With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Today Edison International reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share compared with $1.31 per share 1 year ago.
Core earnings were $0.72 per share compared with $1.26 per share 1 year ago.
The decrease in earnings was primarily due to 3 factors: Losses at Edison Mission Group delay in the California Public Utilities Commission final decision on SCE's 2012 General Rate Case and an increase in holding company costs due to state tax adjustments.
Jim Scilacci will provide additional details on the quarter in his remarks.
There are 3 main areas on which I will focus my comments this afternoon: Our restructuring efforts at Edison Mission Energy the recently received Proposed Decision on SCE's 2012 General Rate Case and an update on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station or SONGS as we call it.
Let me start with Edison Mission Energy.
In past earnings calls I have explained Edison International's overall strategy.
We believe the most effective way to participate in the growth opportunities arising from the substantial changes occurring in the electric power industry is through a dual platform of regulated and competitive businesses.
However we are acutely aware that the competitive generation sector has been deeply challenged for some time by cyclically low margins and capacity values.
For the last few years EME has focused on developing innovative approaches to environmental compliance and careful capital stewardship principally as a means to buy time for a recovery in power markets and energy margins and stabilize the company.
But despite great efforts and many successes by EME the adverse power market trends have only deepened and EME's operating losses this year have increased significantly and are expected to continue.
At the same time EME has a capital structure and financial leverage created in better times that is no longer workable under current and foreseeable conditions.
Under current projections EME will not be able to repay the June 2013 bond maturity of $500 million.
There is also no assurance that EME will pay the $97 million of interest due on its bonds on November 15 or within the 30-day grace period that follows.
Failure to pay interest on the bonds will likely result in EME filing for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
A bankruptcy filing by EME this year would result in its being deconsolidated from Edison International.
This means that the assets and liabilities of EME would be removed from Edison International's consolidated balance sheet upon a bankruptcy filing.
The earnings of EME would be included in Edison International's earnings up to the time of a bankruptcy filing together with any charges related to deconsolidation.
After a bankruptcy filing the results of EME would no longer be included as part of Edison International's earnings and our results will largely be the earnings of Southern California Edison less our holding company costs.
As we discussed on our last call EME entered into nondisclosure agreements in June with the advisors to holders of the majority of its unsecured bonds.
Discussions with the advisors have been ongoing.
As disclosed in our 10-Q filed today certain of the advisors' clients executed nondisclosure agreements last month to facilitate further discussions.
We remain in discussions and under nondisclosure agreements and therefore Jim and I will not be able to comment further during the Q&amp;A session in this call or in subsequent discussions with investors until a public filing about the discussions occurs.
I recognize this may be frustrating to some of you but we appreciate your understanding in this regard.
Let me now turn to Southern California Edison.
Rate based growth at SCE spurred by needed investment and California public policy mandates has been the cornerstone of our stock's investment thesis for some time.
SCE received its long-awaited proposed decision for its 2012 General Rate Case on October 19.
The Proposed Decision provides a level of base revenue through 2014.
As is normal procedure SCE intends to file comments with the commission on November 18 (sic) [November 8] that identify various technical and other procedural items in the proposed decision that need correction.
Oral arguments are scheduled for November 16 and a final decision could come at either the November 29 or the December 20 meetings.
The Proposed Decision does significantly reduce SCE's requested operations and maintenance expense overhead expenses and rate base in order to moderate customer rates.
Although challenging we expect SCE will manage its costs over the rate case period consistent with the final authorized revenue requirement such that it can earn its allowed return on common equity.
Moreover during the 2012 to 2014 rate case period capital spending continues to support infrastructure investment and results in rate base within our previously disclosed forecast range.
Turning to our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station SCE has filed plans with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to restart Unit 2 at 70% load for an initial 5-month period.
Unit 2 did not experience anything near the level of tube-to-tube wear found in Unit 3 even though it operated twice as long as Unit 3 and consequently is in a condition that it can be restarted earlier.
A team of outside experts has confirmed that operating at reduced power will eliminate the physical conditions that caused fluid elastic instability which is the phenomenon that caused the unusual tube-to-tube wear and tube failure in Unit 3.
The shorter 5-month operating period we are proposing is designed to provide an additional margin of safety.
The NRC has made clear that they will not commit to any schedule for a return-to-service decision.
Concurrently with their review SCE continues to work with its outside experts and the steam generator designer and manufacturer Mitsubishi Heavy Industries on what it will take to restore both units to full load.
It's not clear at this time if the units can be repaired and it appears complete replacement of the steam generators would take some years.
We continue to place the highest priority on safety before a restart of any unit at SONGS.
And we will remain diligent in recovering costs incurred from the outage from warranties and insurance.
A comprehensive review of the outage at San Onofre by the California Public Utilities Commission will take place under the Order Instituting Investigation adopted on October 25.
This will consolidate all proceedings and consider appropriate cost recovery for applicable SONGS costs after January 1 2012 including steam generator project as well as the market power costs capital and O&amp;M costs and seismic study costs.
SCE will file a response to the order by November 26 and testimony by December 10 detailing costs subject to refund pursuant to the provisions of Public Utilities Code 455.5.
I would like to note that the EdisonConnect smart meter program is nearing completion.
The program remains on schedule for completion this year and is on target at its authorized capital cost of $1.25 billion.
Close to all of the planned 5 million meters have been installed as of September 30.
SCE is rolling out new products and services to its customers providing monthly budgeting tools and incentives for managing electric use which will be increasingly helpful when tight supply and demand conditions return next summer as a result of reduced output from San Onofre.
The other key regulatory decision coming up at the California Public Utilities Commission in December is the first phase of the cost of capital decision.
This first phase includes SCE's allowed return on equity for 2013.
The proceeding remains on schedule for a proposed decision on November 19 and a final decision on December 20.
The second phase of the proceeding which would address terms of any trigger mechanism is scheduled to conclude in April of next year.
SCE continues to make its case for a proposed 11.1% rate of return a 40-basis-point reduction from the current 11.5%.
As the General Rate Case Proposed Decision acknowledges California wants strong public safety and infrastructure and policy-related investments from its utilities.
We expect the commission will similarly consider California policy-specific facts that have traditionally resulted in an above-average national-average rate of return.
I would like to finish by reiterating what I mentioned on our last call regarding dividend policy.
As we gain clarity on the cash flow outlook for Southern California Edison with the final General Rate Case and cost of capital decisions we will be in a better position to over time move back toward our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of utility earnings.
This will of course depend on successful execution of our capital spending program and earning our allowed return.
I believe the resolution of several strategic uncertainties combined with a strong rate base and dividend growth potential make Edison International an increasingly attractive company to investors.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim Scilacci to provide his financial comments.
Thanks Ted and good afternoon everyone.
Please turn your attention to the teleconference deck and we're going to step through the various pages.
Page 2 of the presentation summarizes the quarterly earnings comparison that Ted has already touched on.
The quarter has a number of moving parts and is complicated by the absence of SCE's General Rate Case decision and a couple of tax items that I will walk through.
Please note that the non-core items in the quarter relate to 2 things: First is the presentation of Homer City which is now recorded in discontinued operations in both periods; second is a gain at Edison Capital which is part of Edison Mission Group related to the third quarter sale of its remaining lease interest in the Beaver Valley nuclear station.
Before I talk about the business results holding company costs in the third quarter included a $0.09 per share impact from the changes in state tax calculations.
The majority of this impact relates to a change in our consolidated state tax apportionment factor going forward as we expect lower sales outside California from declining revenues from Homer City and Midwest Generation facilities.
The balance of the change reflects an increase in income apportioned to California from prior periods due to a recent court case.
Even though these items are from prior periods we have included them in core earnings because changes in estimates are part of managing our ongoing tax positions.
SCE's third quarter core earnings were $1.11 per share $0.14 below last year.
The decline largely relates to the delay in the General Rate Case decision and SONGS outage-related costs.
As we have said on prior calls that SCE's 2011 revenues -- authorized revenues does not cover certain costs mainly higher depreciation and financing costs.
These total $0.09 per share in the quarter.
As Ted indicated if the final GRC decision is received timely revenues to offset these costs would be recorded in the fourth quarter.
SCE continued incur inspection and repair costs related to SONGS outage which had a $0.09 per share impact during the third quarter.
In addition SCE's third quarter results included a $0.09 per share severance reserve which reflects the previously announced staffing reductions at SONGS.
To be clear we have included inspection and repair costs and the severance reserve in core earnings.
During the third quarter SCE continued to manage its costs carefully given the rate case uncertainties providing a benefit of $0.06 per share.
And finally income taxes and other items contributed a net favorable $0.04 per share.
The effective tax rate declined on lower pretax income and higher property related deductions part of which resulted from finalizing our 2011 tax returns.
Next I'd like to turn to the implications of the Proposed Decision in the General Rate Case on capital spending and rate base.
Page 4 summarizes some of the specifics that Ted alluded to in his comments.
Importantly the post-test year escalation for capital additions is commensurate with our projected range of capital expenditures.
Turning to Page 5 we have added at the lower left of the slide capital spending incorporated in the Proposed Decision.
In all years keeping all other factors constant capital spending would remain within our request and range cases.
As noted at the bottom of the slide we now see actual capital expenditures are likely to fall below the range case during 2012 primarily from the delay in receiving the General Rate Case decision and from delays associated with the Tehachapi transmission project.
We would expect to make up this shortfall in CPUC jurisdictional capital spending by the end of 2014 consistent with the overall 3-year authorized spending levels.
We will update SCE's capital spending forecast after we receive a final rate case decision most likely as part of our full year financial reporting.
Page 6 shows the corresponding impact of the Proposed Decision on rate base again keeping all other factors constant with the prior forecast.
You can see that the authorized rate base which is on an average year basis falls within our request and range cases consistent with a 7% to 9% rate base growth.
Turning to Page 7 regarding SONGS.
Ted has already spoken to many of these points but I want to touch on a few financial elements.
We believe we have incurred the cost needed to return Unit 2 to service at partial load.
We have no further estimates on any cost to return Unit 2 to full-service or to restart Unit 3 pending the technical evaluation that Ted discussed.
In September SCE invoiced Mitsubishi for $45 million for inspection and repair costs paid through June 30 by SCE and its partners.
We expect to issue additional invoices for recovery of inspection and repair costs.
In October SCE submitted its initial claim to Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited or NEIL for loss recovery under its outage insurance.
SCE will recover the maximum indemnity amounts for each unit under our outage policy which is $3.5 million per unit per week after a 12-week deductible.
For both the warranty and insurance there is no assurance of any recoveries.
SCE has not recorded any recoveries in its results pending further actions by NEIL and MHI.
Please turn to Page 8.
We provided information on EMG's results and the appendix pages have the detailed operating information.
Suffice to say that business conditions for merchant generators remains challenging.
The availability and forced outage rates at Midwest Generation for the quarter improved over last year and Midwest Generation controlled its O&amp;M costs in light of the market conditions.
However Midwest Generation's results were adversely impacted by lower energy prices.
This also resulted in lower generation levels higher fuel costs driven by higher coal transportation costs and lower capacity prices.
Natural gas project earnings declined at the Sunrise project due to the expiration of its long-term power contract.
Page 9 updates liquidity position for our companies and the bottom half of the page provides EME's tax benefit position.
On the latter point $185 million tax allocation payment made by EME in the quarter was as expected and EME anticipates receiving a net $160 million in payments from EIX by next spring.
Given the lateness in the year and a lack of a final GRC decision we do not plan to provide 2012 earnings guidance.
On February 26 2013 tentatively we plan to report fourth quarter and full year results and to provide 2013 earnings guidance.
Okay thanks.
Now I'd like to turn it over to the operator and move into the Q&amp;A session.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Ted when we think about Mission I know you're not going to go to comment on where negotiations are.
But a little over a year ago you said that the resolution should be done in 12 months and obviously your negotiations which has continued this on.
But are you thinking there is kind of a mental deadline where you need to be done with this process? Or is this something that could stay open ended even beyond the interest payment timeline if you're comfortable with negotiations going forward? I think kind of the short answer is the pending interest payments really pretty much bring this thing to a head.
So I'd be hard-pressed to see how it could extend past the interest payment period.
Research Division</strong> So the November 15 plus 30 days is kind of the timeline within that that band would be as far as it could go? That's the way we've been thinking about it.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I guess just one other question on the 10-Q.
I guess On Page 43 you showed the book value for EME as you guys have it right now.
Should we assume that the -- effectively net $1.1 billion is that what we should think of as your book value that would be exposed to a tax loss carryforward if -- or exposed loss to get a tax benefit if it were to go bankrupt or you were to give up your interest in the business? Dan this is Jim.
I think it's really complicated to tell you that what kind of tax loss there might be associated with EME because there's a time element here.
And it depends on potential monetization of tax benefits.
So I can't even begin to suggest what is appropriate to use for modeling purposes.
And I think overall you should consider it not material.
And our next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> My question is around SONGS.
I wonder first whether you could outline for us your expectations with respect to a determination or the date by which the CPUC would determine the amount of your revenue requirement that would be subject to refund? What is the schedule of the proceeding? Ron you want to take that? Yes this is Ron.
The commission really hasn't laid out a schedule.
It's very early on.
President Peevey did comment that the review would be exhaustive.
So it would likely be some time.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> "Would likely be some time " is that the end of the sentence? Yes.
Period.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> Period right.
The second part of that question is are there precedents that we could use from for example the treatment of Unit 1 or other nuclear power plant outages or other plant outages in California as to the range of possible outcomes in this proceeding? What portion of the plant's revenue requirement is most at risk? Hugh this is Jim.
I can't even begin to speculate on something like that.
As we've said before we believe our actions surrounding SONGS have been reasonable.
And we will look to maximize our recoveries and insurance through our warranty from MHI.
And so we will do all we can to minimize the potential costs for all parties involved.
And our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> I was wondering if you could address the rate base on Slide 6 of the 2014 GRC PD of $23.4 billion.
And then Footnote 1 breaks it into -- breaks the forecasted range into a number of components.
I wonder if you could maybe at least break it into -- the PD into jurisdictional rate base and then transmission? Just think of it this way.
FERC jurisdictional rate base would be about approximately 20% of the number here that you see for the GRC PD at $23.4 billion.
So that's just a rule of thumb.
And I'll pause there because I'm now forgetting the first part of your question.
You need to reask it Gregg.
Research Division</strong> That was really just to break the 2014 PD rate base for cash into its components.
So maybe we could get a sense on our own of potential earnings impact? Yes.
So I think if you take the $23.4 billion and you have 80-20 as a rough rule of thumb between CPUC jurisdictional and FERC jurisdictional.
And your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> Just a question on the San Onofre review.
To the degree that the commission I think potentially has to move the asset out of rate base into some other laws pending the review are you still able to book the earnings from the asset during the review even if it's in a separate clause? Or is there any kind of accounting issue with continuing to book the terms? Well I think we can and under 455.5 it specifies what the mechanism is.
But I'll look over to Linda Sullivan and she can provide some additional information.
So if the asset is taken out of rate base what we would do is remove it from rate base move it into a regulatory asset account.
And then we would have to continually assess the probability of recovery as we move forward.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
But there would have to be some kind of issue in the process that would cause you to assess and it's unlikely for it to be a problem to book it? So we're going to have to make a determination.
And if you remember back during the...
It's quarter by quarter.
It's going to be quarter-to-quarter.
We have to assess -- it's under FAS 71.
As you assess the recoverability of the cost.
And based on where we stand today and the facts that we know our actions were reasonable and we will look to recover those dollars.
Now if the commission did something otherwise the facts may change.
Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> First question is can you -- I know you don't want to go anywhere on these negotiations on Mission.
But I'm just wondering if you could give us sort of conceptually some kind of an idea of what types of things would trigger a disclosure filing? And how -- is that part of the process or is that just something that may happen? This is Ted.
I think essentially the consideration there is as I mentioned originally we were just discussing and negotiating with the advisors of some of the holders of the bonds.
More recently that's moved to discussions with the advisors of a subset that are -- of clients.
So we have nondisclosure agreements with those clients and so that means they are restricted.
So there are some spots here and this is what we were alluding in the comments there are some spots here where those holders the direct holders are not going to be -- or not going to want to be restricted.
And there would be some disclosure that would give the history of the discussions so-called cleansing disclosure.
But I think that's the next disclosure that would likely come forward.
But while we're still in negotiations all parties have decided that we would just simply state we're in negotiations and that's where we are at this point.
Research Division</strong> So Ted remembering back to the Homer City that would be a kind of -- you're talking about some kind of a financial outlook disclosure that would be triggered by having disclosed it to them.
It wouldn't necessarily be a sign you are agreeing on anything is that -- are we thinking of that correct? You can't really -- I mean there are so many potential outcomes here.
I think what we are relating to is there's some spot here where there will be a so-called cleansing disclosure.
Whether that will be the result of an agreement or not we really can't speculate.
And there are different percentages of bondholders that end up getting involved in this thing over time.
But I think you just -- it's unfortunate we'd like to be a lot clearer about some of these things but really all we can say is we're in continuing discussions with the advisors and the bondholders.
And that's really where we are for the time being.
Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Coming back to the proposed decision in the rate case looking at Slide 4 that $15.09 billion rate base in 2012 is there any CPUC items CPUC-regulated items that you can earn on but are not included in that $15.09 billion? I'll pause here and look at Linda Sullivan for help.
So it does not include the solar rooftop program for the 125-megawatt reduction.
It also does not include the SmartConnect program and the steam generator replacement program.
Research Division</strong> Can you quantify just put some numbers around those 3 items please? We have not disclosed that.
Research Division</strong> You've not disclosed...
So what we're trying to do in the Page 6 it provides the full rack-up of the full rate base numbers.
So we haven't provided the individual pieces here Michael.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So the GRC PD of $20.1 billion if I subtract $15.09 billion from that the rest of it is a combination of the other CPUC-regulated items plus FERC-regulated transmission.
That's correct.
You got it.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Just curious though I don't know -- I think you've done it in a public filing.
What your latest FERC transmission rate base is? Well what we said in 2014 it's going to be about 20% of the $23.4 billion number.
So we'll have to back up.
So we're right in the midst of filing our update proceedings for this year.
And I think it's less than 20%.
Why don't we just say we'll get you a number? It's approximately 15% of the total rate base but we'll get you a more exact number because that's in the public domain.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just real quick.
Were there dramatic changes to depreciation schedules as part of the PD? There were many different changes to the depreciation schedules that were in the request.
And in some cases the judge agreed with our recommendations.
In other cases he agreed with the interveners.
And overall it was a reduction of about $100 million from our request.
And we're still working through the Proposed Decision and through all of the details.
Just to follow up on that we'll have -- we're filing comments on the Proposed Decision to the extent that there are things we will comment on and depreciation could be one of those.
Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Citigroup.
Research Division</strong> I know you guys didn't touch on it in your prepared comments because it's a bit more California related in a broad sense but we've seen a lot more color or chatter recently about resumption of resource adequacy and capacity market type commentary in California.
And to my knowledge I don't think you guys have really commented on that formally.
But can you just give me your sense of where you think that's headed? Particularly since Calpine-Sutter decision seems to have touched off a little bit of concern in the state? Okay Ron Litzinger will cover that.
There's nothing formally set-up or established any proceeding at this point.
But certainly as you stated Sutter has got everyone thinking about capacity markets again.
And the people are starting to prepare to engage in discussions in an appropriate forum if one develops.
And Brian just to follow-on on that because of the potentially need for capacity out past the end of the decade with once through cooling situation still ongoing and potentially SONGS.
There's -- that's why I think you're seeing a little bit more chatter associated with capacity markets.
Research Division</strong> Is there a particular structure or approach to that at least in broad terms you know that would be supportive of? I don't think we can have a company policy that we could tell you.
We're obviously given our experience at EME we're very familiar with the capacity structure in PJM.
We've been heavily engaged since the capacity market was ultimately created.
There are some very positive things associated with that but there's also some challenges in terms of the way they've managed it.
So you have to weigh the pluses and minuses and you have to ultimately think about the impact on the rate payer overall.
So if there were a proceeding what would it go through? The long-term resource adequacy proceedings or would that create a separate proceeding? I think it would be a separate rule making.
And our next question comes from Kit Konolige with BGC.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just a couple of kind of follow-up questions.
Jim did I hear you correctly saying that any tax-related loss or tax advantage from a loss at EME would be not material at the EIX level? I did say that.
Okay.
And then can I ask generally should we be assuming I know this is kind of early in the central [ph] process but can we be assuming that you would want to replace the steam generators at San Onofre again? In other words is -- should the base case assumption be that SONGS will run for a good number of years in the future? Kit this is Ted.
I'm going to answer that with kind of largely a non-answer.
Fundamentally we're focused on Unit 2 making sure that we can restart Unit 2 safely.
We did a lot of work on that came to the conclusion that we could.
That's why we applied for approval to the NRC to restart Unit 2.
There's things that we are going to -- once we run Unit 2 assuming it's approved to restart once we run it for the 5 month period take it down reinspect that will certainly provide quite a bit of information.
As we said in the comments here a lot of work continues around what are the possible options for Unit 3 what might be able to be done in a repair or a replace scenario.
So there's a lot of work that's going on but way too early at this point for conclusions or speculation around whether units would be replaced or repaired or run at partial power or for how long.
It's just premature at this point.
Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Ted coming back to you big picture question.
In your opening remarks you painted the picture on EME markets have not improved nor seeing any signs in the foreseeable future.
If you take your year-to-date results at the EBIT level you're reporting a loss.
So even if all the deck was eliminated you would still be booking losses at EME.
Am I missing something here? Or other than a bankruptcy filing I mean what is left here to be thinking about in this process? Well we did indicate that there's significant losses this year and also said that we would anticipate under current market conditions for there to be losses in future years.
And that is part of our thinking around what's the best course.
I think we've been pretty clear on this and I won't spent a lot of time reiterating it.
But -- that if we are continuing with EME we've got to address the capital structure.
It's over-levered for the type of conditions that we see.
And we have to be able -- we Edison International have to be able to see a stable path forward with EME.
We have to be able to turn to our equity investors and say "It makes sense to retain ownership of EME because we see a stable capital structure that's appropriately fitted for the market conditions." Absent that then we look at the other principal option which is no longer having ownership.
So those are the areas that we've been talking about and looking at with all of you.
And I think you've put your finger on the principal problem and that is market conditions don't really support positive earnings for some period of time.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay fair enough.
And then second question on SONGS.
Can you remind us year-to-date how much expenses have been incurred that you believe ultimately are eligible to be reimbursed to you? What's the total amount? $96 million.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> $96 million pretax? Correct.
Correct.
Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
I have a question about the timeline for the next couple of months.
So you mentioned that you need the cost of capital proceeding to be done to have a better visibility into SCE's earnings power and that will determine the ability to increase dividends going forward.
Now I'm worried because we've seen a number of cases being delayed in California.
And how comfortable are you that there's going to be a decision in the cost of capital proceeding still this year? It's a great question and the history with our PD hasn't been good in terms of the delay.
And cost of capital it's gone very efficiently thus far.
The hearings were on time.
The ALJ that's involved in the cost of capital proceeding that's assigned has had a history of doing this proceeding and he's is knowledgeable of it.
And so I would anticipate a Proposed Decision on time in the latter part of November.
Now then it's up to the commissioners to make a decision before the end of the year.
I think an important thing here why the commissioners are going to be interested in making a final decision by the end of the year because there's a rate reduction that they want to put in place.
And if you delay that decision you can't effectively get that rate reduction.
So I think they'll be motivated to do it on time.
Okay.
And then say I mean -- assuming that there is a resolution with EME and their potential lawsuits we should assume that any lawsuits will not impact your ability to decide on the future dividends? Well Angie just so we're clear the source of the dividend is solely and completely from Southern California Edison.
And I can't speculate on what might or might not occur during that process.
But we rely solely and exclusively on SCE for the dividend.
Okay and last question.
Can you give us at least a ballpark of the amount of costs that are going to be coming back to the parent? I assume that Edison Mission currently absorbs some of the parent level costs.
I mean could you give us at least a sense of how big about number that is? It's pretty small it's Angie it's Jim again.
I think we've put something in the disclosure.
It's maybe $0.02 or less so it's a minor amount of cost.
Our next question comes from Leslie Rich with JPMC.
Inc.</strong> I'm sure I've asked this question before but your ROE on the FERC transmission I think in the past you said it basically earns the same ROE as the California-regulated business.
Is that the case? And in the cost of capital proceeding the distribution ROE will be reset.
Does the FERC ROE sort of automatically get reset or does that sort of happen gradually over time? Do you have incentives on some of the larger lines? Just if you could just flesh out what the sort of average FERC rate base ROE would be.
Okay Leslie.
This is Jim.
We're going to have Linda Sullivan who is the CFO of the utility answer that.
Leslie for the FERC ROE currently for the 2012 General Rate Case which is currently under settlement proceedings we have a 9.93 base ROE.
And then we add to that a 50-basis-point adder for participating in the Cal ISO and then we have specific project incentives on our major transmission projects the Tehachapi project and the Devers-Colorado River project which puts us at a weighted average ROE at 11.1 for FERC.
Now in terms of how that works going forward as I mentioned we are currently in settlement proceedings.
For the FERC component of the ROE? Yes.
And so that you file annually with FERC.
So that could potentially impact the FERC ROE for 2013? We have filed for a 2012 FERC formula filing and that formula filing is currently under settlement proceedings.
So FERC return on common equity could go up or down depending upon the mechanism we use there Leslie.
So that's a good question.
And there's information in our disclosures that gets to a little bit more detail on that.
Our next question comes from Travis Miller with MorningStar Securities Research.
Research Division</strong> A little bit of speculation here.
But if the CPUC were to adopt the PD as is on the final day of the year what do you estimate that full year impact on EPS and possibly revenue would be? Yes Travis this is Jim.
I'm sorry we haven't put out guidance for 2012 and we'll just have to wait and see what the decision actually says.
I know you said assuming that they approve the Proposed Decision as is.
So we will look to provide information regarding our earnings for 2012 when we report the full year financial information in February.
So I just can't be helpful there.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
One other follow-up if -- what projects in that CapEx reduction -- are there any specific projects in that CapEx reduction? Are they maintenance CapEx projects? What kind of projects were in that PD CapEx reduction? Okay.
You're talking about the Proposed Decision.
There's a host of different things.
I think the important part from our perspective that we received about 96% of our distribution capital.
So that goes to the core reliability issue.
So the things they did not approve has to do with a host of different things IT related.
There's solar rooftop program that we had a timing problem where we went in at the full 250-megawatt and we voluntarily reduced it by 125.
So they had to pull that out of the decision.
There's some real properties.
Linda anything else you want to...
Capitalized software project.
Capital -- so we will have more detail on that as we file our comments on the Proposed Decision.
We'll have some charts on that but that will be later.
Research Division</strong> Are you pretty okay with that? Is that going to be a key part of the rebuttal whatever you -- for the [ph] file? Or is that pretty well accepted? I think what Ted said is is the fact that we will adjust our spending to what's authorized by the commission.
And I think importantly we got the majority of our distribution capital expenditures.
Our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
Can you just Ted -- I haven't read the Q can you just talk about regarding what's happening with Mitsubishi in terms of when we hear back from them whether they accept and the negotiations going on? Is there any feedback that you can provide on timing of talks with Mitsubishi? Yes.
I seem to get the questions where I provide little to no information.
We really can't go into it at this point.
And we've of course been very much involved with Mitsubishi all along the way on the whole root cause evaluation all of the work that led to our response to the Confirmatory Action Letter to the NRC.
Mitsubishi was very much involved working with ourselves and a number of other outside independent experts on coming to those conclusions.
So at the technical level there's been quite a bit of interaction with Mitsubishi.
And they've been cooperative throughout all of that.
In terms of the commercial elements really our focus has been so much on the safety requirements and on the technical issues relatively less on the financial side.
Jim gave you some specifics about some of the early billing that we've done or invoicing that we've given them around some of those costs.
But it's what I would really characterize as fairly normal course kind of discussion at this point.
But Ted have they said that they're not going to pay or anything like that they've accepted the bills? What is the kind of the due date on that invoice? So we've billed them the $45 million and the invoices are being reviewed.
And this does conclude the question-and-answer session.
I will now turn the conference back to over Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone for participating today and please don't hesitate to give us a call if you have any follow-up questions.
Thank you.
And that does conclude today's conference.
Thank you very much for your participation.
You may disconnect at this time.
Good afternoon.
My name is Melissa and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thank you Melissa and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our SEC filings are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
We will be using the slide materials in our regularly quarterly business update presentation that will be posted tomorrow on our website to support our ongoing investor discussion.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
[Operator Instructions] With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Today Edison International reported full year core earnings of $3.92 a share an 18% increase over 2011.
These strong results demonstrate Southern California Edison's ongoing ability to deliver rate base growth and cost management even during an extended period of rate case uncertainty.
On a GAAP basis we reported a loss of $0.56 per share.
This loss reflects the previously announced write-down of our interest in Edison Mission Energy following its bankruptcy filing last December.
Although EME will no longer be part of our business portfolio going forward I want to commend the leadership and employees of EME for their contributions to Edison International over more than 25 years and for their professionalism during some very difficult times.
We wish them every success in the future.
Most of my remarks today will concentrate on how we have been and will be working to serve our customers and thereby produce long-term value for our shareholders at Edison International.
We group this work into 3 strategic efforts: one resolving uncertainties and reducing business risk; two creating sustainable growth in earnings and dividends; and three preparing the company for transformative change in our industry.
We made notable progress in 2012 although this will be a multi-year effort.
Let me address how we have been resolving uncertainties and reducing business risk.
We anticipated 2012 would be a year in which key decisions would be made.
Perhaps most important was the need to find the best path for stabilizing EME and determining its future role in the EIX portfolio.
The direction for EME is now clear.
We reached agreement in December with EME and a majority of the EME bondholders that set forth the terms and conditions under which Edison International will turn over its equity interest in EME to the creditors when EME emerges from bankruptcy.
This agreement referred to as the Transaction Support Agreement is subject to the bankruptcy court's approval.
EME is scheduled to bring the agreement before the court for approval this summer.
For investors our core business remains Southern California Edison which continues to have excellent growth prospects.
We started last year with 2 major regulatory uncertainties SCE's 2012 to 2014 General Rate Case and its 2013 cost of capital.
The General Rate Case was decided late last year.
Also the California Public Utilities Commission approved SCE's cost of capital for 2013.
And early this year a tentative agreement was reached among the major parties in the cost of capital proceeding to retain the existing adjustment mechanism through 2015 updated for recent interest rates.
This agreement is consistent with what SCE had originally proposed.
A proposed decision has now been issued and we expect a final decision by April if not before.
The remaining significant uncertainty we face involves our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station or SONGS.
It's worth reviewing what our objectives have been since the tube leak was discovered over a year ago.
First and foremost nuclear safety is our paramount goal.
We do not say this lightly we mean it.
This is why we bristle so when elected officials issue press releases suggesting that SCE was aware of design problems with the replacement steam generators when they were installed at San Onofre.
This is just not accurate and it injects politics into a process that should be free from it.
We would never and did not install steam generators that we thought were unsafe.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries the vendor who designed and fabricated the replacement steam generators even warranted them to us for 20 years.
Our second objective has been to ensure reliability of electric service to our customers.
Last summer the co-owners of SONGS along with several California governmental agencies implemented temporary contingencies to avoid interruptions to electric service.
We were fortunate to have a relatively cool summer.
We are now taking other actions for this coming summer in the event SONGS Unit 2 isn't yet approved to restart.
However we will again need to rely on mother nature to be cooperative and the western electric grid to be trouble-free.
Longer term it would become increasingly difficult to meet reliability requirements without SONGS.
Replacement generation and transmission would be necessary expensive and take a long time to permit and build.
Our third objective is to receive fair recovery of our costs.
We have a proceeding beginning at the California Public Utilities Commission which will determine the rate making for the 3 buckets of cost: replacement power plant O&amp;M expenses and the return of and on our investment in the plant.
There are a few scattered precedents that we can look to for clues as to what fair recovery might look like including SONGS Unit 1 but these situations are case-specific.
As we have previously stated we are seeking cost recovery from MHI and the nuclear industry insurance provider NEIL.
We provided some updates on our efforts with both entities in our 10-K but let me touch on one aspect related to MHI.
There are applicable exceptions both in the MHI contract and in law to the MHI warranty cap of $138 million.
SCE has notified MHI that it believes one or more of these exceptions now apply and that MHI's liability is not limited to $138 million.
MHI has advised SCE that it disagrees.
If the disagreement can't be resolved it may ultimately become subject to dispute resolution procedures set forth in the contract including international arbitration.
The fourth objective recognizes the importance of timing.
Of course we would like to have the uncertainty surrounding SONGS resolved as quickly as possible.
However given the importance of nuclear safety here all of us directly involved must spend as much time as is necessary to ensure safety.
This is why we spend as much time working with MHI and several other independent experts before coming to the conclusion that it is in fact safe to restart Unit 2 under the operating parameters we submitted to the NRC.
We are convinced it is safe to run the unit.
Now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must make its decision.
One more comment about timing.
The old adage of time is money certainly applies here.
It is costly both in dollars and in risk to reliability to have Unit 2 remain idle.
Let's be clear.
The antinuclear interests involved here know that the longer they can tie up SCE and the NRC in process the more expensive and uncertain it is to restart SONGS.
San Onofre has been a crucial component of grid stability and electric service reliability for Southern California for many years.
Furthermore nuclear power is an ultralow carbon power generation source and helps California meet its ambitious clean energy goals.
We would very much like to get the unit operational in time for the summer.
Our sincere hope is the technical safety evaluation can occur and other necessary NRC procedures completed without unnecessary delay and in time to accommodate these reliability and clean energy goals.
The second prong of producing long-term shareholder value is creating sustainable growth in earnings and dividends.
Since 2007 SCE has increased rate base by $8.5 billion or 11% annually.
The main drivers of this growth have been implementing state policy mandates such as 33% renewables and advanced meter technology along with replacing aging electrical infrastructure.
Looking ahead through the balance of the decade we see solid growth in rate base continuing even without new policy mandates.
SCE will continue to focus its investment in the wire side of the business and largely leave construction of conventional and renewable power generation to the competitive marketplace.
While we waited for a rate case decision that would be -- that would determine authorized capital spending SCE managed 2012 capital investment at the existing 2011 authorized levels.
Since the rate case uncertainty is now behind us we are moving to increase capital spending in 2013 and '14 such that we are investing at authorized levels over the 3-year rate case cycle.
One of the ways we are ensuring reliable and affordable service for our customers is through operational excellence and cost control.
It also is part of creating sustainable growth in grid reliability investments and hence rate base and earnings.
We made decisions in 2012 to address SCE's organizational and cost structure to make it more efficient for the future while managing costs effectively during the extended General Rate Case review process.
This had some positive impacts on costs in 2012 largely through managed attrition and will contribute to 2013 as Jim Scilacci will describe in more detail.
In the fourth quarter of 2012 SCE recorded severance charges for reductions in force.
SCE is working on other ways to control rates and improve service.
We are working with our regulators to address rate design issues including the substantial cross subsidizations embedded in current rates.
We are also optimizing power procurement which accounts for about 40% of our total electric rate to meet policy goals on a least costly basis.
During 2012 SCE also completed its installation of 5 million smart meters on schedule and ahead of budget.
These smart meters provide cost efficiencies to ratepayers and enhance reliability and they allow customers to better manage their energy use and electric bills.
In December we announced our ninth consecutive yearly dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.35 per share.
We anticipate SCE's capital spending to peak this year allowing its operating cash flow to expand.
This will provide the basis to move our common stock dividend in steps over time to our target range of 45% to 55% of utility earnings.
This is a payout we consider appropriate given SCE's potential rate base growth.
We believe this provides a significant total shareholder return opportunity for Edison International shareholders.
The third and final strategic element for creating long-term value is positioning the company for transformative change in the electric power industry.
We don't need to go much further than hydraulic frac-ing and the impact it's had on reordering the economics of electric generation and gas price-sensitive industries to understand the potential for transformative change in our industry.
There are also the clean tech startup companies that are so much a part of California's business culture and of which the state is so proud.
While very few of these companies are actually profitable today we continue to enjoy substantial public policy and venture capital support.
We believe these trends require our careful attention especially given the long-lived nature of our assets.
The question is what is actionable and practical? It starts with exploring the feasibility of developing businesses that capitalize on industry change and leverage our own knowledge and strengths.
Edison International sees merit in the ownership and operation of competitive businesses as a matter of corporate strategy and is exploring areas related to the provision of electric power and infrastructure including distributed generation electrification of transportation water purification and power management services to the commercial and industrial sector.
I don't expect these new initiatives will distract us nor should they distract investors from our SCE-focused value proposition.
However I believe it would be foolish to dismiss the potential for substantive -- substantial change in our industry or in the utility business model.
So we will continue to look for ways to build strategic flexibility and leadership at the right pace that could provide new avenues of growth in a rapidly changing world.
Let's come back to this year and finish by talking about our 2013 earnings outlook.
Today we are introducing earnings guidance of $3.45 to $3.65 per share.
This outlook largely reflects our operational excellence efforts and significant investment in our core wires business.
Let me now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci to provide additional material on our financial results and earnings guidance.
Jim? Okay.
Thanks Ted and good afternoon everyone.
I'll start with a quick reminder on the basis of our financial presentations following Edison Mission Energy's December bankruptcy filing.
Please see Page 2 of the presentation.
For all periods provided in our materials EME is now reported as discontinued operations and part of non-core results.
Beginning with first quarter 2013 we will no longer include EME's results as we are now accounting for our ownership on the cost method under GAAP.
Also the remaining investments that are part of Edison Mission Group but separate from EME which are immaterial are now reported as part of Edison International parent and other category.
In the presentation appendix we have provided 2 years of quarterly financial results on the new reporting basis to help you updating your financial models.
Given that Southern California Edison's General Rate Case was received during the fourth quarter and because the financial consequences are effective beginning January 1 2012 fourth quarter comparisons are not all that helpful.
However full year comparisons present a clearer picture of the underlying business performance.
I'll be using Pages 3 and 4 of the presentation as I walk through the key earnings drivers.
Starting on Page 3.
You will see that for the quarter there is an $0.82 per share true-up for SCE's 2012 General Rate Case decision.
Simply think of this as the incremental impact attributed to the first 9 months of 2013.
This includes 3 primary items.
First is higher revenue to cover both rate base growth and operating costs.
You will recall in our financial results for the first -- excuse me for the 3 prior quarters we reported higher depreciation and financing costs without corresponding revenues.
Now we are recognizing the related revenue without the corresponding costs.
Second is a $0.10 per share disallowance on certain enterprise software costs.
This is shown separately in our full year summary on Page 4.
The third is a tax benefit that is more complicated to explain but it requires a bit of background information.
Back in 2009 EIX made a voluntary election to change its tax accounting method for certain repair costs incurred on SCE's transmission distribution and generation assets.
This proposed regulatory treatment was then incorporated in the 2012 GRC filing.
The 2012 GRC decision adopted the proposed flow-through treatment for these tax deductions and as such SCE recorded in 2012 a non-core catch-up benefit related to the 2009 2010 and 2011 periods.
In 2011 IRS regulations allowed SCE to make a second voluntary election to change its tax accounting method for repairs which is expected to result in additional earnings benefit through 2012 through '14 GRC period.
In the 2015 GRC the estimated tax benefits will be trued up again and SCE expects the earnings benefit will be eliminated as the estimated tax benefits will be fully flowed through to customers.
So now let's walk through the earnings impact.
The year-over-year change in repair deductions is $0.54 per share including $0.19 in the fourth quarter.
Because a portion of the repair deductions is included in the 2012 GRC and flowed through to the customer rates the incremental tax benefit that impacted core earnings for 2012 is $0.35 per share.
In the non-core section for both the quarter and full year results you will find a $0.71 per share earnings benefit related to the 2009 through 2011 periods.
Tax benefits for repair deductions will continue in the current rate case cycle and are included in our 2013 earnings guidance which I'll talk about later.
Operating revenue is $0.09 higher than the fourth quarter reflecting -- in the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of the GRC decision.
This is partially offset by higher current period depreciation and financing costs.
For the full year operating revenue is $0.63 higher which is partially offset by higher depreciation and financing costs.
Staying with the quarterly story earnings benefited favorably by $0.07 per share from lower O&amp;M as SCE continued to optimize its cost structure.
The fourth quarter severance charge is $0.15 per share and $0.20 per share for the full year including the $0.05 per share SONGS severance charge recorded in the third quarter.
Severance costs in the fourth quarter represent planned employee reductions in 2013 as SCE continues to drive operational efficiencies that will be included in its 2015 GRC which is expected to be filed in the third quarter of this year.
Our share of SONGS inspection and repair costs is a positive $0.05 per share in the quarter and reflect SCE's share of an initial $45 million warranty payment from MHI received in December.
The MHI payment is for costs incurred through the first half of 2012.
Net of this payment full year SONGS inspection and repair costs are $0.12 per share.
A little remaining piece is an SCE tax item which represents an increase in property-related tax deductions as well as tax true-ups.
There are also several moving parts in a now combined EIX parent company and other category.
I won't spend as much time here and we'll focus on the full year impacts as shown on Page 4.
Full year EIX parent company costs increased $0.10 per share year-over-year of which $0.07 relates to higher consolidated income taxes.
The remaining $0.03 is from higher overhead costs including additional parent company costs related to EME.
EMG's net performance is a negative $0.06 per share year-over-year primarily because of swings in income taxes that were favorable last year and unfavorable this year.
Turning to non-core items.
I previously mentioned the catch-up repair tax benefit.
The only other item is an $0.08 per share charge related to de-consolidation of EME as we adjusted our consolidated deferred tax liabilities from the expected transfer of ownership of EME to creditors.
We have previously mentioned EME's results are now in discontinued operations.
For the quarter the total noncash charge was $4.07 per share and $5.17 for the full year.
These charges reflect the losses incurred by EME prior to its bankruptcy filing on December 17 and the write-down of our entire investment in EME and related charges.
There is additional information regarding EME de-consolidation accounting and tax treatment in the EIX 10-K.
As a reminder under our settlement EME will remain consolidated through 2014 so tax calculations as of the end of 2012 will not be the same as the end of 2014 when tax de-consolidation occurs.
I'd like to turn next to SCE's updated rate base and capital spending profile.
Growth in rate base earnings for the long-term drivers -- remains the long-term drivers of SCE's earnings growth as Ted has already mentioned.
The rate base figures shown on Page 5 are presented on a year-end basis not on a 13-month weighted average basis used for earnings purposes.
The 5-year compounded annual growth rate is 11% for rate base and 15% for core earnings.
On Page 6 we show the capital expenditures for the 2012 GRC period.
Currently we are finalizing a more detailed capital spending plans for the 2015 through 2017 period must be incorporated into SCE's 2015 initial GRC filing.
We expect to make this filing referred to as the Notice of Intent in July or early August.
After making the filing we expect to update our forecast to include both 5-year capital spending and rate base forecasts.
There are minor changes from the third quarter capital expenditures forecasts which had a base case using the GRC proposed decision of $12.5 billion from 2012 through 2014.
Our updated base case forecast is $12.1 billion or a reduction of $400 million.
Most of the difference relates to reduction in the Solar Rooftop Program and an extended spending plan for transmission projects.
We continue to provide both the forecast of range cases based on actual versus forecast construction experience in the past several years.
The slight reduction in capital expenditure only has a minor impact on the updated rate base forecast shown on Page 7.
The midpoint for 2013 of $21.6 billion is comparable to the forecast of $21.7 billion that was included in our third quarter slide presentation.
And the 2014 midpoint of $23.2 billion is comparable to the prior GRC PD-based forecast.
This forecast is on a 13-month average for CPUC authorized rate base which is consistent with how earnings should be modeled.
For both years the split between CPUC and FERC rate base is approximately 80%-20%.
Also please keep in mind that bonus depreciation for 2013 will not impact authorized CPUC rate base.
The majority of the cash benefit of bonus depreciation will not occur during 2013 because of our consolidated NOL position.
On Page 8 we've summarized the key regulatory and policy decisions involving SONGS.
Ted has covered many of these points but I do want to note a couple of items.
First is cost recovery.
Under the California regulatory model SCE continues to recognize revenue covering all relevant SONGS-related expenditures including O&amp;M return of and on investment and replacement market power.
These costs are now subject to the CPUC OII review which commenced as of November 1.
The first phase of that 4-phase review has now been scheduled for completion by this summer.
The first phase financial review scope includes 2012 SONGS-related O&amp;M and capital expenditures.
Page 9 updates the key costs and rate base data as we've been sharing with investors.
As noted at the top of the slide replacement power for 2012 for SONGS outage represents about 8% of SCE's purchase -- power purchases which totaled $3.8 billion last year.
SONGS rate base is approximately $1.2 billion or 6% of total rate base.
As you are aware construction work in progress earns an equity return or AFUDC.
So it's appropriate to think of rate base and clip as total earning asset base or approximately $1.4 billion.
Our accounting of SONGS reflects SCE's belief that its actions taken in cost incurred in connection with San Onofre replacement steam generators and outages have been prudent.
Accordingly SCE considers its operating capital market power costs recoverable through rate base and ERA balancing accounts as offset by third-party recoveries where applicable.
SCE cannot provide assurance that either both units of San Onofre will be returned to service that the CPUC will not disallow costs incurred or refund -- order refunds to customers of amounts collected in rates or that SCE will be successful in recovering amounts from third parties.
Disallowances of costs and a refund of amounts received from customers could be material and adversely affect SCE's financial conditions results of operation and cash flows.
Please turn to Page 10.
This page is an updated version of the cost of capital mechanism than many of you are familiar with.
As Ted has indicated the Utilities and ERA reached an agreement to extend the cost of capital trigger mechanism through 2015 and we hope to receive the final decision as early as March 21 -- at the March 21 commission conference meeting.
The slide shows how the Moody's Baa Bond Index has moved over the years.
The mechanism would continue to provide 100-basis-point deadband above and below an index rate which is proposed to be reset at 5%.
Movement above or below this deadband over the relevant 12-month period can trigger an increase or decrease in the ROE.
As of January 31 the moving average was 4.55%.
Please turn to Page 11.
Settlement discussions continue regarding SCE's 2012 formula -- FERC formula rate proceeding.
One of the dispute issues is the appropriate return on common equity.
In our filing SCE has incorporated a 9.93% base ROE plus 50 basis points for California ISO participation plus other specific project incentives.
After SCE resolves its 2012 case the 2003 formula rate case will be addressed.
It's important to note that SCE is appealing with the D.C.
Circuit Court a 2008 FERC decision which set SCE's return on common equity based on a methodology that utilizes the median peer group ROE rather than the midpoint of the peer group.
We disagree with FERC over this approach.
The proceeding has been briefed and oral arguments are scheduled for March 25.
Please turn to Page 12 which covers the 2013 guidance.
I'll focus on the key assumptions behind the guidance.
Our core earnings per share guidance of $3.45 to $3.65 per share is built off a 2013 starting point of a simplified SCE earnings model we have discussed previously.
To remind you the simplified approach takes average authorized rate base times the allowed return times the percentage of equity in the capital structure and divides this by the number of shares outstanding.
This approach assumes SCE manages its spending thus allowing utility to earn its authorized return.
This approach also assumes that earnings from allowance refunds used for construction are used to offset certain costs that are either not recovered through the regulatory process or are shareholder-supported like corporate advertising or corporate contributions.
Based on our $21.8 billion average rate base forecast and the blend of CPUC and FERC returns and capital structure and flat share count as summarized to the right of the slide we get a base case of $3.39 per share for SCE.
Normally we would arrive at EIX consolidated core guidance by taking the SCE simplified earnings and then reducing it by EIX holding company costs of $0.15 per share.
For 2013 there are 3 positive items we need to add: first there are O&amp;M savings stemming from labor reductions and process efficiencies discussed previously; second as I previously mentioned there are continuing benefits from repair deductions; lastly there are expected energy efficiency earnings from our 2011 program activities.
Together these total $0.31 per share.
This gets us to the point -- gets us to a point estimate of $3.55 per share which we have ranged to actual guidance of $3.45 to $3.65 as Ted already mentioned.
For long-term modeling purposes we continue to think the simplified approach is a good starting point for estimating SCE's future earnings power.
Moreover earnings benefit from repair deductions and operational efficiencies will flow through to customers in the 2015 General Rate Case.
Lastly 1 key point.
2013 earnings guidance assumes full recovery of SONGS-related costs and no further recoveries from MHI.
I'll close by reiterating a few key messages that are value -- investor value propositions summarized on Page 13.
Simply stated we have a strong track record of utility earnings growth good visibility on investment requirements and resulting rate base growth.
And we are growing cash flow that will support over time a return to our targeted dividend payout ratio.
Okay thanks.
Now I'd like now to turn the call over for Q&amp;A.
Operator? [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Dan Eggers Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Listen I'm sure there will be lots of SONGS questions to come.
So Ted I was wondering if you could just maybe share some thoughts as you think about kind of the next 3 years of CapEx for the next GRC cycle? What -- without maybe giving these exact numbers what you see kind of the major buckets of opportunity or need for investment as you guys kind of look out over the next planning parameters? Yes I think the primary one is the distribution system.
There's a slide I forget the page but it shows that over the next 3 years over 60% so coming close to 5/8 of the capital expenditures are really in the distribution area.
We continue to believe there are substantial opportunities on that side.
In fact historically we've put in to our rate cases for more in the way of a systematic infrastructure replacement.
That usually becomes some discussion particularly with some of the consumer groups and consumer interveners.
It gets knocked back.
So we tend to think there's a lot more that needs to be done on that side.
There's continuing need for electric grid reliability and strengthening.
I think we'll only see kind of more of that as there are discussion about trying to improve reliability overall across the nation.
So I think it's really the wires piece and particularly in the small wires piece that we see the greatest opportunities.
There will be stuff around the fringes.
We pretty much signaled here we're not looking to do a huge amount in the generation side.
That would really be more left for the competitive marketplace.
But here and there there'll be some kind of special circumstances like we've had in the past that will contribute a little bit.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I guess maybe turning to dividend policy obviously with the increase in the fourth quarter.
How -- can you just explain to me how you think about rating into that 45% to 55% payout ratio going forward? And once we get past SONGS and the GRC filed is there a potential to change the dividend before the fourth quarter? Is that going to be the standard timeline you guys are going to look for? Yes.
It's a good question.
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to give you a great satisfactory answer here because there is a certain amount of we'll have to see.
And I think you know us pretty well.
We've -- we tend to be fairly conservative on these things.
We don't want to get ourselves committed to a higher dividend and then have to struggle.
So we are outlining and have been signaling to investors for some time now that we see the bulge in capital spending as probably being this year.
And with that we'll see a little bit of tapering off in the annual capital spending from what it has been.
That actually creates kind of a bow wave of cash which we think positions us well to move that dividend up back up into that 45% to 55% of utility earnings targeted payout ratio.
We're really staying away from trying to predict.
We can get there in 1 year we can get there in 5 years we get there in whatever.
It's -- it really is a matter of what the pace of capital spending will be.
That's a little hard to exactly predict.
And we'll balance it off with opportunities for growth.
But it's pretty clear to us we'll be moving back into that targeted payout ratio.
Next question comes from Jonathan Arnold Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> In the 10-K Jim you disclosed that the repair deduction is expected to be $50 million in 2013.
Is that effectively an after-tax number i.e.
do we need the further tax adjusted? And secondly is that a good number to assume for '14 as well? It is an after-tax number.
It was larger in '12 declined in '13 and we'd expect it to decline slightly in '14.
So we haven't put out '14 guidance.
So there's a trend downward is all I'm warning.
Research Division</strong> But you said slightly.
Less than the decline occurred in '12 I guess or in '13? Sorry.
It's going to be below '13.
How about that? Research Division</strong> Okay.
All right.
And just on Slide 7 on the right there is this 7% to 8% number in the green box.
Just wondering if you can clarify exactly what that refers to.
Is that the comment on what '14 is over '13 which I guess it could be if we rounded it? Or is it a comment on '15 to '17 after '13 '14 base? If you take 2012 as the base year and show the growth for '13 and '14 you're going to get to 7% to 8% projected rate base growth for that period from '13 and '14.
And once we file the NOI we will do that same calculation for you for the full 5-year period.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So this is specific to '13 and '14? Correct.
The next question comes from Stephen Byrd Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to -- Ted you had mentioned the impacts to the California grid of SONGS being out and you mentioned the need to have mother nature cooperate.
I just wanted to better understand as you think about the situation in California if Unit 2 is delayed in terms of restart and if it is a fairly hot summer can you just expand further as to scenarios and impacts to grid reliability of SONGS being out? I can do that but I'm going to actually let Ron Litzinger do that.
He's got really a little bit better grip on it and closer to it.
Yes our plan for 2013 is going to be very similar to what we did in 2012 which are accelerate transmission upgrades that were out in the future forward and complete those in time for this summer to increase flows into South Orange County and a big focus on demand response as well which we were successful with last year.
And we will reinitiate those this year and even incorporate some lessons learned from last year.
Huntington Beach which was available last summer is not available as a generator this summer.
And we will be looking at additional transmission upgrades to provide that flow-through support.
So we're doing everything we can.
We continue to plan for a 1 in 10 summer and we will just see how it goes.
But it's more the same and it's primarily on the transmission side.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Understood.
And then just shifting more on the NRC side of things.
I think everyone's following the dialogue there.
But just if you can help us particularly with respect to the Unit 2 dialogue to understand upcoming key timelines we should be thinking about and just general activity on Unit 2 to make sure we're thinking about things correctly.
Yes on the NRC we are continuing to answer questions that we receive from the NRC.
On our submittal we will continue to do so and participate in the public meetings as they go on.
The latest indications from the NRC are that they expect a late April May time frame to make a decision.
The wildcard remains the hearing with the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board on the Friends of the Earth petition.
The next question is from Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Hopefully 2 quick questions.
One in the K when you guys mentioned the NRC process you state that the Unit 2 may -- before it restarted it may require one or more amendments.
If you guys could just give some more color on that or what you think the amendments would be.
And two in your 2013 guidance I was curious have you assumed the same revenue component necessary for SONGS that you've received in '12 and '13 guidance? Now I'll take the guidance question.
I think in the guidance chart we assumed that we get full cost recovery so that's the full return of and on depreciation O&amp;M and so forth.
And to the extent that there is additional replacement power that's being booked in the ERA balancing account.
And obviously that's subject to future reasonableness review as we go through the proceedings.
And I think I also said in my prepared remarks we've assumed there will be no further recovery from MHI over and above the $45 million that we have already recovered and our shares is obviously less.
The $45 million is 100%.
And so that's the current state of affairs as far as what's embodied in '13 guidance.
And I'll pause and look over to Ron as far as the first part of the question.
Yes there are -- with regards to license amendments clearly there is the Friends of the Earth petition which is in front of the Atomic Safety Licensing Board as to whether our Cal submittal is a de facto license amendment that is out there.
And then there are focuses in the questions we've received as to the process going forward.
Our review of past actions by the NRC on units that have derated a license amendment isn't required.
We'll just have to see as we go through the process.
Hard to speculate what will happen.
The next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Two questions a little unrelated.
First on SONGS and picking up a little bit from where Anthony left off.
Is there precedent that you're aware of that if you do have to get a license amendment whether you can operate while you're going to the filing process to get that amendment? Ron do you want to handle that? Yes.
I'm just thinking for a second.
I'm not sure that I could cite precedents.
If we put in for a license amendment it can be handled 1 of 2 ways.
The staff could find what's called a no significant hazards determination which is a -- potentially a shorter process and then there is the full-blown process.
And we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out.
It'll be tough to speculate at this point.
Research Division</strong> Under either process there's a shot that the NRC would let you operate while going through the process.
It's my knowledge only that no significant hazards determination has that opportunity and it's not guaranteed there either.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
Ted Jim on related topic the filing of Edison Mission in December and the signing of the TSA I don't think included the extension of bonus depreciation which occurred after that.
How should investors think about whether there is risk of the TSA unwinding there is risk of debate over worthless stock deductions requiring cash payments from EIX to bondholders? How should investors who like SoCal Ed story think about that cash flow risk at the parent level? Michael we're going to have Bob Adler our General Counsel give you a comment on that because he was directly involved in negotiation the transaction.
Bob? As you know back in December the majority of the bondholders and EME and we EIX signed a transaction support agreement which contemplated an extension of the tax sharing agreement in accordance with its terms.
We're all bound to support that agreement and we continue to support that agreement.
And I believe that the other parties are as well.
It's ultimately up to the court to assess whether the agreement is going to be of help.
So beyond that I don't think there's much I could add to the situation.
Research Division</strong> But if I -- I just want to make sure I understand this because the cash flows that would have happened through the end of 2014 are a different number than what -- pre-bonus depreciation post-bonus depreciation.
So just curious in terms of is there any recourse by the EME bondholders to come back to you and say "Hey wait a second we're not going to get as much cash because SoCal Ed is less of a cash tax payer now?" Well the agreement is quite specific in that there is no guarantee of tax payments or any particular level of tax payments under the agreement.
And of course changes in tax law are always a possibility as these were.
So again all of the parties signed an agreement have agreed to support it and until we hear otherwise we are going to continue to support it.
The next question is from Jon Cohen from ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> I just had a couple of questions on your Slide 12 of the deck.
The light blue box where you show $0.31 of uplift versus your rate base implied earnings so I think we said before that $50 million or about $0.15 of that in '13 is from the income tax repair deduction.
Is it safe to assume that the rest so $0.15 to $0.16 is ongoing that the O&amp;M savings and energy efficiency should roughly offset the EIX parent expenses? Yes.
And when you say ongoing we're saying and in my prepared remarks that these benefits will occur in '13 and '14 that -- but we would expect the O&amp;M savings and the tax deductions to be trued up as part of the 2015 GRC.
And I'm not sure what's going to happen with energy efficiency.
I think we'll have -- this is the 2011 program year benefit and so we'll have 2012.
And then they'll have a new plan after that.
So I can't tell you beyond that what could happen in '15.
Research Division</strong> Can you give us a rough breakdown of how much is O&amp;M and how much is energy efficiency in '13? Well I think you have the component parts there to come in pretty close.
And the energy efficiency earnings is $0.03.
And then we've already talked about the benefit of the income tax deduction -- repair deduction for 2013.
So the O&amp;M savings is the difference between those 2.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And lastly are there any opportunities to further reduce the parent G&amp;A costs going forward? It's a good question.
What we've been doing is watching the staffing at the holding company based on the bankruptcy filing of EME.
Obviously there are some things that EME used to draw upon that we're not doing any longer.
So we are incurring some costs at the holding company to support some of the new business activities that we're looking at now.
And we haven't broken them -- broken those out or provide any additional color associated with them because they're pretty small.
In the ongoing cost for the holding company historically there's been approximately about $0.01 a month or $0.12 a year.
It kind of gives you a rough order of magnitude but we're going to watch those -- that number very carefully as we know the holding company is at cost center it doesn't provide any earnings and we're going to manage that as carefully as we can.
Next question is from Hugh Wynne Sanford Bernstein.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> First question regarding the income tax repair deduction that -- you mentioned that that would be trued up in the '15 GRC.
The point you're trying to make just to be clear is that this is not going to be an ongoing benefit earnings because of the pass-through but there's no clawback.
Is that correct? That's correct.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
The other question what -- which utility would you be looking to as a successful example of diversification in the competitive enterprises such as the ones you mentioned? I'll take that one Hugh.
This is Ted.
I think there are various people out there that are kind of looking around but I don't think anybody's really gone significantly into any of these areas.
Most of the nonutility activity as you well know is -- I'll call it traditional central plant and most often fossil or nuclear gencos.
We're not talking about that here.
This is something different.
So it's really looking at some of the new business activities.
As I indicated most of those you look around the country nobody really is making money hand over fist in those.
So it is something you've got to be I think mindful of watch the trends identify areas where you think there is the most potential opportunity and find a way to participate but at a pace that isn't a distraction and allows you to get a little closer to what those trends look like without putting a significant financial risk around them.
So I think it's -- probably the better examples would be in other industries where there's been substantial change transformative or disruptive change to ultimately to the core business.
The companies that have been most successful in those industries have been ones that early on spent some time trying to understand where some of these longer-term trends could take you and get involved in relatively small activities in those startup areas so that if the trends really develop or start to accelerate you have something of a platform something of a basis for redirecting some of your capital and energies into those businesses so that you're not caught flat-footed.
And that's the concept that we're working at.
So I think it's probably the examples are better identified in other industries than they are in our current industry.
This is the last question.
Ali Agha from SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Jim when you look at all the different schedules going on for SONGS right now and particularly at the California Commission level et cetera just looking at that process when at the earliest do you think you would be in a position where you may need to relook at your accounting or cost et cetera? Yes that's a good question.
Obviously here at fourth quarter I think every time you file SEC reports you're going to need to look at your accounting or if there's some kind of triggering event that would cause you to reassess if some event has occurred.
So we will do that every single quarter then we file our financials and look at the prudence of our actions if something new appeared or the NRC does something.
So we got to do that constantly.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> But just to be clear on the triggering event is there anything in that process as it stands right now the future schedule that you could point us to to say that may or may not be a triggering event? Not that I could see right now because the 4 stages of the Commission's process it's going to take some time before we're to a proposed decision.
So we're in the latter part of the year before we hear under the first stage.
And it's important too in terms of what's happening with the NRC process to hear about what's going to happen with Unit 2 and that informs our decision-making around Unit 3 too.
So I think if anything it's probably going to be in the latter part of the year before the next signpost might occur.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And 1 other question.
Ted given your commentary on future investment needs I believe the distribution business et cetera wires et cetera going forward should we look at 2014 CapEx as kind of a good proxy for how CapEx should be trending going forward? In effect should CapEx actually come down even from that level? Yes it's a good question and I'm not sure we have a great answer at this point.
But we will have to start showing some visibility to that as we get into our next rate case cycle.
So the summer we'll kind of have our first filing for the new rate case cycle and you'll get a little bit better feel for it there.
But I think to be frank generally what we've experienced as I indicated is we have more opportunities than probably really capacity with ratepayers and -- to manage the affordability of electric rates on the capital investment side.
So the real game here is to try to be very judicious in the prioritization of those investments.
And as we've tried to signal here today really look hard at how efficient we are on the operational side so that we can free up as much in a way of dollars to go towards the capital investment and reliability and instead of having to just go out in O&amp;M.
So those are the ways we're trying to unleash as much potential investment in those areas as we can without putting too much pressure on the affordability of customer rates.
Now I'll turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much Melissa.
This concludes our call today.
Thank you all for participating.
Thank you.
And this does conclude today's conference.
All parties may disconnect.
Good afternoon.
My name is Sharon and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International First Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks Sharon and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
We will be using the slide materials in our regularly quarterly business update presentation that will be posted tomorrow on our website to support our ongoing investor discussions.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
[Operator Instructions] With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thanks Scott and good afternoon everyone.
This afternoon Edison International reported first quarter core earnings of $0.77 per share compared to $0.54 per share a year ago.
This represents a strong start to the year.
The primary driver for our earnings remains Southern California Edison's substantial investments in electric infrastructure supporting public safety grid reliability and state policy objectives.
We also reaffirmed our core earnings guidance for the year at $3.45 to $3.65 per share.
Jim Scilacci will review the quarter in detail in his comments.
In our year-end 2012 earnings call I highlighted the 3 mainstays of our commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders.
The 3 were: resolving uncertainties and reducing business risk creating sustainable growth in earnings and dividends and preparing the company for transformative change in our industry.
I'll use this same framework for my comments today.
Our work to resolve uncertainties and reduce business risk currently centers on our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station or SONGS.
Safety of the public and our employees remains our paramount goal.
Our restart plan for Unit 2 is predicated on this.
Also San Onofre plays an important role in the reliability of the electric system in Southern California.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission continues to evaluate our Confirmatory Action Letter response which contains our plan to return Unit 2 to service at 70% power for an initial 5-month period.
The key now is for the NRC to conclude its work in determining if Unit 2 is safe to operate under these parameters.
With its April 16 notice in the Federal Register the NRC has requested public comments on SCE's proposed license amendment.
This amendment would align San Onofre's license with our Confirmatory Action Letter response to the NRC in which we detailed our return-to-service operating plan for the current roughly 2-year fuel cycle.
If approved SCE would be required to later obtain necessary authorizations for long-term power operation beyond that cycle.
The license amendment notice also requests comments on the NRC's proposed no significant hazards consideration determination.
This finding is an important procedural step that allows for prompt review of our license amendment request.
It's worth noting that this conclusion is what is found in most license amendment requests.
The NRC's consideration of our restart plan continues to attract a level of controversy and opposition.
Although the license amendment decision is a technical staff decision the NRC commissioners have the right to review any staff-proposed license amendment decision.
Also the public has the right to file motions to stay issuance of license amendments before the NRC and federal courts.
Even if the license amendment is approved by the staff their approval of our Confirmatory Action Letter restart plan for Unit 2 could still take time.
Our overarching desire is for the various outside parties to let the nuclear safety technical work proceed at the NRC to assure a safe and timely restart of Unit 2 without unnecessary delay.
Without a restart of Unit 2 a decision to retire one or both units would likely be made before year-end 2013.
There are many potential decision scenarios involving Unit 2 and Unit 3.
They all have different implications for grid reliability customer costs attainment of greenhouse gas and air quality objectives and many other factors.
We look to narrow these uncertainties and the potential operating scenarios for both units before the end of the year.
We will continue to press for a recovery from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries the designer and manufacturer of the steam generators.
It would not be appropriate so we won't go into the specifics of our strategy and approach.
SCE has moved ahead with its initial outage insurance policy claims under the nuclear insurance program called NEIL.
As of December 29 2012 SCE had filed claims under the outage policy of $234 million of which our share would be approximately $183 million.
These outage claims represent the maximum available recovery applicable for that claims period under the policy.
We don't have a clear timeline of when NEIL will make a decision on these or future claims.
Any recoveries are expected to be refunded to customers through the E-R-R-A ERRA balancing account.
We continue to believe that the actions taken and costs incurred in connection with the San Onofre replacement steam generators and outages have been prudent.
Although it cannot be assured we continue to believe that all material costs related to San Onofre are recoverable through base rates and the ERRA balancing account as offset by the potential third-party recoveries I mentioned.
We remain in the early stages of the CPUC proceedings to review the rate-making for these various cost categories and hearings on the reasonableness of 2012 incurred costs are scheduled to begin in mid-May.
Also under the category of reducing uncertainty are the steps taken last year regarding EME.
I would note that the examination of the Transaction Support Agreement we reached when EME filed for bankruptcy continues through considerable discovery in the court process.
As a result EME and others have requested extending the target dates for moving this process forward and our 10-Q discloses that an extension is under discussion.
Turning to our efforts to create sustainable growth and earnings and dividends.
I'd like to focus on the important enabler of moderating customer rate increases.
We must keep rates moderate to facilitate continued support for infrastructure investment.
While SCE essentially redoubled its rate base in the past 6 years this fast pace of growth led to some inefficiencies and rising costs which can add pressure on customer rates.
To counter this we redoubled our focus on operational excellence and took actions to improve efficiency and get the most from our infrastructure investments.
Continued focused on managing costs will help keep rate increases modest for customers.
In addition to managing overall rate increases it is important to design rates that better match costs and avoid burdening one category of customers unfairly.
A key policy topic here is rate design.
Today's tiered rate structure which with the implementation of the 2012 GRC is now 4 tiers  rather than 5 puts most of the burden of residential rate increases on those who use more power.
This includes those with high air-conditioning loads who live in the warmer inland areas who sought to escape the high cost of housing on the coast and who can't necessarily afford the increases.
We are encouraged by the unanimous committee approval earlier this month of a California Assembly Bill #327 which would remove key barriers to the CPUC creating a new rate design.
This bill is supported by a wide range of community labor and business organizations.
We are hopeful that we'll pass the assembly in May which would then move it to the senate for consideration.
Approval will provide the CPUC the authority it needs for the rate design proceeding that it has already launched.
SCE will be submitting its initial proposals to the CPUC next month on its rate design proceedings.
The third and final strategic element for creating long-term value is positioning our company for transformative change in the electric power industry.
We see merit in owning and operating competitive businesses as a matter of corporate strategy.
Therefore we are in the early stages of developing businesses that capitalize on industry change and leverage our knowledge and strengths.
Prime areas of interest are distributed generation electrification of transportation water purification and power management services to the commercial and industrial sector.
These efforts have to be at the right scale and the right pace.
We aren't going to bet the farm.
They have to be actionable and practical and they must prove themselves.
I don't expect these new initiatives will distract us from our core business at SCE nor should they distract investors.
However I believe it would be foolish to dismiss the potential for major changes in the utility business model.
That concludes my comments.
I'll now turn it over to Jim Scillaci.
Thanks Ted and good afternoon everyone.
I'll start on Page 2 of the presentation.
As Ted said EIX's first quarter core earnings were $0.77 per share $0.23 ahead of last year.
SCE results drove $0.22 of the $0.23 variance.
There are a number of components at SCE that will make quarterly comparisons complicated including the delay in the 2012 General Rate Case decision SONGS refueling and inspection and repair costs and the completion of the SmartConnect project and elimination of related project costs.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis higher 2013 revenue attributed to a net $0.13 per share to the earnings increase.
The biggest difference was driven by the delay in the GRC decision.
During 2012 we recorded revenue based on 2011 authorized levels pending a final decision.
Based on the GRC decision the estimated revenue attributed -- attributable to the first quarter of 2012 was $0.15 per share.
During 2012 we also had authorized revenue for the planned refueling outages at SONGS.
Because there are no refueling outages in 2013 there was a $0.07 negative variance.
We also had an increase in 2013 revenue mainly due to 2 items: a $0.09 per share in CPUC and FERC revenues partially offset by a $0.04 negative variance from the SmartConnect project.
We collect revenue associated with the implementation of SmartConnect this year -- last year and it did not reoccur this year.
As everyone is aware SCE's authorized return on common equity is set at 11 -- excuse me 10.45% for 2013 compared to 11.5% last year.
However the earnings reduction associated with the lower ROE was offset by the incremental increase in average CPUC and FERC rate base during the first quarter of 2013.
Turning to the cost side.
There was a net $0.09 per share positive variance in O&amp;M which was made up of 4 primary elements: first SONGS inspection and repair costs were $0.04 in the first quarter of last year.
In the first quarter of 2013 those costs were less resulting in a $0.02 per share positive variance.
As I mentioned above the absence of SONGS refueling cost -- outage cost this year provided a positive variance of $0.06 per share.
Severance costs in the first quarter of 2013 were $0.03 per share higher thus provided a negative variance.
Lastly the SmartConnect project had O&amp;M costs recorded in the balancing account in the first quarter of 2012 of $0.04 resulting in a positive variance this year.
The variance of depreciation and interest expense was a negative $0.05 and $0.03 per share respectively largely associated with rate base growth.
We also recorded expected tax benefits for repair deductions of $0.05 per share consistent with our 2013 earnings guidance.
Finally taxes and all other provided a positive $0.03 variance.
Moving to the parent company and other costs which are shown on the left part of the slide.
These costs are comparable year-over-year with a $0.01 difference due to a small contribution from Edison Capital.
As we have previously said we are not making new investments in Edison Capital and we're slowly liquidating the remaining portfolio.
We had 2 non-core items in the first quarter.
The first was in the parent company and other category where we had $0.02 per share benefit from a lower-than-expected level of state income taxes from last year's sale of Edison Capital's lease interest in a power plant.
The second relates to EME.
With EME now de-consolidated for accounting purposes any changes in tax or other accounting estimates will flow through the income statement as discontinued operations.
We recorded a $0.04 per share benefit from updated estimates from future tax de-consolidation of EME.
The first quarter of 2012 loss of $0.26 per share reflect the EME losses that were previously part of the financial results prior to bankruptcy.
The same presentation will continue for the balance of 2013 and we expect periodic positive or negative adjustments related to EME to be recorded as non-core items and discontinued operations.
On Pages 3 and 4 we have included our capital spending and rate base forecasts through 2014.
These are unchanged from our year-end financial reporting.
Total capital expenditures in the first quarter were $814 million.
Currently we are finalizing our expected capital spending plans to be included in the Notice of Intent for the 2015 General Rate Case which we will file in the third quarter.
Because of an aging infrastructure and reliability needs we plan to seek an increase in our proposed distribution capital spending.
However we also foresee lower transmission investment as construction of 2 of our major transmission lines are scheduled to be completed later this year.
Our goal is to find the right balance amongst safety reliability and affordability such that we can achieve our goals with modest total system average rate increases for our customers.
Ted has covered most of the developments related to SONGS which are summarized on Page 5.
The various elements the CPUC proceedings are moving ahead and SCE submitted its final costs on the steam generator project during the quarter.
Page 6 updates the SONGS costs and rate base information along the lines that we introduced last year.
We have followed the same approach in the first quarter with one change.
Reporting of net market costs for replacement power will now follow the approach requested by the CPUC for periodic filings under the Order Instituting Investigation or OII.
This is a different methodology than the one we used last year which followed the traditional E-R-R-A or ERRA balancing account approach.
The largest difference is the inclusion of market power costs during the planned refueling outages and foregone energy sales.
I'd now like to turn to a couple of regulatory topics starting with the FERC return on common equity.
Please turn to Page 7 of the deck.
Settlement discussions in our 2012 FERC formula rate are ongoing.
One of the many important issues is the base return on common equity of 9.93% which is before incentives.
Since the last settlement conference in late February settlement offers are still being exchanged and are expected to continue into next month.
The settlement judge has not yet scheduled the next settlement conference but has indicated it likely would be in late May.
While the settlement negotiations are confidential it is reasonable to assume that the FERC's preferred methodology results in a lower ROE today than when SCE filed its formula rate in June of 2011.
If a full or partial settlement cannot be reached then the rate case would proceed to litigation.
SCE and FERC lawyers participated in oral arguments before the D.C.
Circuit Court of Appeals on the utilities appeal of its 2008 FERC decision on our CWIP return on common equity.
The key issue here is FERC's policy to use medium return of the proxy group for utilities filing individually rather than using the midpoint of the proxy group.
The decision on the appeal is expected by the fourth quarter.
Page 8 shows they'll now approve cost of capital mechanism for CPUC jurisdictional rates through 2015.
You can see on the right side of the slide that the period-to-date moving average which over 12 months determines whether our change is triggered in the return on common equity although running it below the starting point is well within the zone that would result in no change and allowed return in 2014.
Page 9 shows the reaffirmed core earnings guidance that Ted mentioned.
We have updated our GAAP earnings guidance to reflect the first quarter non-core items only.
Our 2013 guidance continues to include the same amount of repair deductions operation and maintenance and other cost benefits and energy efficiency savings we provided during our year-end call in February.
I'll close by building on Ted's comments regarding shareholder value proposition.
Narrowing the uncertainties around SONGS in 2013 is a key priority for Edison International.
We continue to see significant rate base growth potential reflecting our wires-focused investments program.
We will continue to optimize our cost structure strive for operational excellence and create the foundation for an improved SCE cost structure in our next General Rate Case.
Okay.
I'd now like to turn over the call for Q&amp;A operator.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Eggers of Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Listen just on SONGS and I'm sure we'll have a litany of questions on this today.
But the idea of kind of more publicly stating a willingness to close the plant if you can't get Unit 2 going.
What do you think are the major parameters in making the decision of go no go while you're waiting for an NRC decision? Is it a certain level of cost incurred before you get there? Is it a slowness in movement by the staff? Or will there be some sort of CPUC involvement that maybe shape that decision? Dan this is Ted.
I'll take a crack at your question.
I think principally the thing to understand is effectively we're underwriting the costs here until we have certainty around the rate-making treatment.
That isn't going to get resolved for some period of time.
So there's just I'll say a general limit of how much we can continue to rack up these costs without certainty of cost recovery.
So I think of it as more of a time issue than anything else.
But it certainly is a combination of time and just dollars that effectively we're underwriting with uncertainty about cost recovery.
Research Division</strong> And then I guess in that vein is there a way to lower costs while you're waiting for a decision on the units? Or do you have to keep them fully staffed at these levels for -- until there is a decision? It gets complicated but there's a limit to how much you can pare down costs if you're waiting for a decision on restart because you can't knock down the costs lay off workers that type of thing and expect to bring them back on quickly in order to get the unit restarted.
So essentially you have to run with a level of cost to keep all of the systems at the plant ready to go.
So that if we get the decision to restart we can do so quickly.
Again a large part of what drives us here is SONGS plays a unique role in the reliability of the grid here in Southern California.
Its location as well as its voltage support and to some degree the energy produced from it all of those things are important to reliability.
We're about ready to enter our summer period.
That's when we have our peak demand so we want to make sure we're ready to go when the decision comes forward.
Dan this is Jim.
I'll just add to what Ted's already provided you is that we had already planned as part of the 2012 General Rate Case to reduce our staffing at SONGS.
We have done benchmarking and determined that it was appropriate to reduce the numbers to more competitive levels.
And because of the ongoing problem with San Onofre we are very carefully watching our expenditures both capital and O&amp;M to make sure that we don't create the potential for future stranded costs.
And so the capital is very very -- we're being -- we're watching it very carefully.
And only those things that we must do for safety or reliability we are undertaking.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just the decision that Ted just -- while you're not going to give a number as to the cost exposure a decision will be resolved this year is that fair? That's what we're trying to signal is that there's a limit on timing and everything else.
So we're -- I think it's the first time we've kind of said it that way.
But essentially we're down to months here in terms of being able to have clarity on the NRC decision as well as clarity on the -- some of the rate-making treatment.
Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> So in terms of timelines for these issues looking at Page 5 of your deck you filed for -- you filed with the NRC the license amendment several weeks ago.
Is it correct that there's a -- sort of a specific time frame in which they're expected to respond? And then what are the series of things that have to happen to get you to the point where they either say "Yes you can restart " or "No you can't?" On the license amendment request -- Greg this is Ron.
There are 30 days for public comment and 60 days for parties to provide a notice to intervene.
The commission can make a decision on the license amendment request if there's a no significant hazards consideration following the public comment period.
We're not really speculating on when they would make the call.
The important thing to remember here though is it's the Confirmatory Action Letter response that they have to approve that will give us the permission we need to go forward with the restart.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
But the -- giving you -- if they were to say that those -- that the -- after 30 days hypothetically if they come back on the end of day 30 and say "Okay you can go ahead and restart " you still have to then subsequent to that get an approval of your specific plan before you can actually restart.
Is that correct? After the 30 days they could approve our license amendment request as a potential.
That's just one component of the overall review of our Confirmatory Action Letter response.
They have to approve our Confirmatory Action Letter response which includes the restart plan.
That's the pacing item.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then with regard to cost recovery I'm seeing here that the SONGS OII -- the proposed decision is expected Q3 2013.
Ted just to circle back to the comment the answer you made to Dan's question you're basically proposing that there's a practical limit to how much shareholders should -- can underwrite here.
And if for some reason the commission were unable or unwilling to give you a sort of financial parameters by the end of this year that would cause a significant problem for you? Yes.
I think I'm just going to end up restating the words I used before that what we're trying to signal is it's difficult for us to see kind of continuing to underwrite the costs without clarity on the rate-making treatment and without clarity on what the NRC decision is going to be.
So there's a practical limit to how much we can absorb of that risk.
I think the pacing item here at the moment is the NRC decision.
But it's really both components that are important to us.
Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.
Just another clarification on the NRC process.
So theoretically you -- we should not necessarily read an approval of the license amendment as a likely trigger that they will approve the Confirmatory Action Letter? I think they're independent.
Or actually the way I think of it I think of the license amendment request as sort of a subcomponent of the overall Confirmatory Action Letter.
It's just one piece of the puzzle as they look at our Confirmatory Action Letter response and restart plan.
Okay.
In the 10-Q you also say that you do not expect them to rule by June 1.
Could you just give more color on the timing issue there? And how you would know that? It's just our judgment based on exchange of data requests and analysis back and forth between ourselves and the staff.
So it's our judgment.
Okay.
And you also mentioned these other offers of investigation reviews et cetera.
I mean is there any -- does that play into the timing as well? And has there been anything -- is that the issue that were in the press a few months ago? Or is there something new there? The Office of Investigation was in the press a few months ago.
The additional disclosure around the Office of Inspector General which looks at the NRC internally was a new disclosure.
I think the key point we made in our disclosures is there are many parties that are saying those investigations should be completed prior to any decision being made by the NRC.
Okay.
One last question just on the Edison Mission process.
Could you just give some more color in terms of what is exactly going on with discovery? This is discovery related to your agreement? Okay.
Steve this is Jim.
We're going to have Bob Adler our General Counsel take a shot at that one.
Settlements like this involve an examination process before the bankruptcy court which is like a judicial process.
There is a discovery of documents interviews depositions review of all that.
Our lawyers are working very hard on this as are the other lawyers for other parties.
It takes time.
There are other proceedings in the bankruptcy.
So -- but this is a customary process for settlements like this.
There's a -- there is an inquiry about the value of the settlement to the parties.
Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> Just wanted to ask a bit about CapEx and cash flow.
You had mentioned your expectation that distribution CapEx will continue to rise while transmission CapEx will tail off in the next GRC.
And indeed I guess that trend is evident in 2014 already compared to 2013.
Are those sort of rise in distribution CapEx and decline in transmission CapEx enough to sort of offset each other so that we should expect continued capital expenditures more or less at the average level of the '12 through '14 GRC more or less at the $4 billion level? Or do you see CapEx trending down materially? Yes.
Hugh this is Jim.
We haven't put out a forecast for that period.
We're getting very close to that time frame.
But I think it's going to be roughly in the same zip code how about that? LLC.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then if it's roughly in the same zip code you're freeing up very little incremental free cash.
Are we then putting off for a couple of years the increase in the dividend to your target range? Well we haven't said anything different there.
And we're going to continue with our expressed desire to return to our targeted payout ratio over time.
Our target payout ratio many of you people know 45% to 55% of the utilities earnings.
And our intent is to return over time.
We stepped up the dividend slightly last year and we would look to do that going forward to get back to that targeted ratio.
Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Yes.
Actually 2 questions a little bit unrelated to each other.
First on Edison Mission what happens if we reach that kind of the milepost date in a couple of weeks and you don't get the extension or the parties can't agree on an extension? What happens at that point in time meaning if the settlement isn't approved where do we go from there? Michael I'm going to turn it over to Bob Adler again.
Under the transaction support agreement if a milestone is not reached then certain parties are able to terminate.
It takes an affirmative act to terminate the agreement on 5 days' notice.
Pending any such notice the agreement continues in force for any as I might add or us or the bondholders.
Research Division</strong> And if the agreement is terminated? If the agreement is terminated we'd no longer would have a settlement agreement.
And I wouldn't speculate on what would happen at that point.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
Unrelated Ted you made some comments about investing in some of the non-utility opportunities or the non-utility kind of emerging technologies that seems like -- can you just talk about kind of the range of how much capital you anticipate deploying what kind of levels of returns you're seeking and whether you've got the appropriate structure in place to actually deliver those returns? Yes.
Well the returns would be the same way we look at all our businesses in the past.
We go through a cost of capital analysis for any and all of our businesses whether it's utility non-utility.
And we end up with hurdle rates and any contemplated investments have to show that they can meet or exceed that hurdle rate.
So that part would be the same.
In terms of the amount I think all the words were chosen carefully that we think there's a more likely than not some significant changes that are going to take place over the next few years in the industry overall.
Probably some of those changes will be more accelerated in certain regions of the country than others.
We think ours would probably be one of those.
We want to make sure that while we are exploring these things and trying to kind of stay ahead of the curve that we aren't doing it at too fast a pace or as I use the phrase we're not going to bet the farm on all this stuff.
We feel it's as I said more likely than not that these changes are going to take place.
So we think it would be foolish to turn a blind eye to it.
But we want to be able to kind of take it one step at a time.
And each of these things has to prove themselves along the way.
So that's why we say we don't think this will distract us from our core business at SCE.
We also don't think it should distract investors from that core business.
But it would be foolish to ignore that some of these changes are out there and taking place.
Research Division</strong> But I mean do you view this as EIX may -- Edison International making equity investments in emerging technologies or funds? Or is this a -- kind of a relook at kind of more traditional merchant generation or something dramatically different than either of those 2 alternatives? Yes.
So it's not kind of redoing merchant generation that I think we can be clear on.
We identified in my remarks a few of the areas that really have -- are kind of the areas most interesting to us at this point.
And those are things like distributed generation electrification of transportation I would use the term writ large it doesn't just mean electric vehicles.
In fact I think most of those electrification opportunities are probably more in the movement of goods than automobiles.
Water purification power management services to commercial and industrial sectors so those are the areas we've kind of identified.
We have different levels of effort underway there.
I don't see this as we're going to kind of pretend we're a venture capital company.
We're not.
I think we look at these things from the standpoint of are these businesses that can leverage our strengths leverage our brand and our kind of background? And so they're -- they would be more operating-type activities than venture capital investments.
And I think the final piece is we're more interested in actual tangible projects that would have cash flow or service-type activities as opposed to trying to bet on specific technologies or invest in technology companies or companies that manufacture a new technology product.
So hopefully that'll give you a little bit of a sense of where our focus is.
Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold's line of Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just a quick one on the -- I noticed on your transmission projects slide the large transmission projects Slide 15 there was a proposed changes to the FERC incentives.
Are these decisions that you've had or are they [indiscernible]? Well I will pause and look and -- Linda was there any change? No.
So there aren't any changes that we have and I don't -- that I'm aware of right now.
I think those reflect what we are currently receiving on these projects.
That hasn't changed since -- for some time.
So maybe we can take you off-line Jonathan and we can talk through it after the call.
Recently we filed update on Devers-Colorado River estimates but we had it in last year's or year end as well.
Research Division</strong> But it was on at 125 in the last business update I think.
And now it's 100? And the -- and then Eldorado was -- had a number and now it's an NA [ph].
I think he's talking about incentive [indiscernible] dollars.
Research Division</strong> We can see the incentives right? Yes there's been no changes to the incentives.
Our next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Ted I wanted to clarify some of the earlier remarks just to be clear on a couple of things.
One -- first on the SONGS if I'm hearing you right I mean previously you had requested the NRC to give you a decision for the Unit 2 restart on May 24 so you could start by June 1.
Am I hearing you right that that's unlikely -- that timeline will unlikely be correct? So if that's the case what's the timeline we should be roughly thinking about now? I think the answer to your first question is yes.
And I don't think we're putting a date out there because we're continuing to have discussions with the NRC and the staff in terms of what's going on.
And I think I'll pause there and see if Ron you want to add anything more.
Because I think it's -- purposely we don't have a date is the answer.
And we're going to just continue to work through it until we know more.
Right.
We wanted the NRC to proceed without unnecessary delays and target dates were intended to emphasize the importance of running this summer.
With regards to the broader decision I think Ted said it earlier we're looking at bigger decisions by the end of the year.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right.
And also just to clarify that point I mean as far as I can tell you won't have much clarity or at least from what we've gathered on Unit 3 by the end of the year haven't heard anything at all to suggest that that is reaching a conclusion on the Confirmatory Action Letter or what have you.
So just to be clear I mean assuming that you get this Unit 2 restarted I mean is the likelihood if I'm hearing you right that Unit 3 most likely gets retired? Or what would have happened by year end to give you comfort on turning [ph] on Unit 3? I think on Unit 3 in our disclosures we said that could go beyond year end depending on what we observe should Unit 2 restart and we get some information when we go in and reinspect it.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right.
So I am trying to reconcile that with Ted's remarks about retirement decisions by year end.
How do you make that decision if you're not clear on Unit 3's status by that time? Again I think in our disclosure we said that Unit 3 could slip beyond year end depending on what we observe on Unit 2 should it restart.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And last question Jim if I could.
Going back to your point on the CapEx you're looking at beyond the current rate case cycle.
If assuming that's in the same zip code to use your words would that imply -- I'm assuming it would just to be clear that rate base growth over that period should be in a similar zip code as well? Yes I think this -- capital expenditure's zip code and rate base are going to be similar because they drive one another.
So the answer to the question is yes.
Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Most of my questions have been asked and answered.
I just wanted to follow up on the EME and the request for further time.
I just wanted to check in terms of potential movements that could have in terms of your ultimate tax position should we be thinking about any potential forward movement in terms of your ultimate net tax position? Or is this likely just further discovery further deliberations but we shouldn't be thinking about major changes in cash taxes out? This is -- the discussion is around the proceedings and the process of the proceedings not the -- and the timing of that not the substance of the agreement if that's your question.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So the -- yes so it's really -- so obviously the agreement could always be terminated I guess if things didn't go well.
But absent that it's not as if some tax position could change as a result of these discussions of this delay.
Is that right? We're just talking about the timing and the proceeding.
It's not affecting the tax position at all.
Our next question comes from Paul Fremont of Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I guess my first question has to do with the ability of Unit 2 to operate at levels above 70%.
It seems as if the steam quality problem is resolved at a lower level of operation.
So is there anything that the company is basically able to do assuming that the restart is allowed that would enable that plant to go beyond 70% on a long-term basis? Yes.
Let me handle that one.
I don't think we want to get into a lot of speculation about future power levels and those types of things at this point.
What we've proposed is 70% for 5 months.
And then we're going to take it down and reinspect it.
I think the key objective at this point was to put forward a plan that we knew had lots of margin for safety around it and that was the focus.
So this is a first-of-a-kind event.
We wanted to make sure we had abundance of safety margin.
Once we get clearance assuming we get that and we have the operating period then there's opportunity to think in terms of whether different power levels are appropriate.
But at this point the focus is just on coming forth with a plan that has sufficient safety margin for a first-of-a-kind event.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Well maybe I -- maybe just to rephrase my question I mean what -- has the company determined what the fix would be to the current problem? I mean other than the fact that at lower levels of operation you don't get that that doesn't happen.
But is there something that sort of proactively would fix the problems that you've identified? I don't think I'll attempt to restate my words.
I just would say it the same way I did.
So the focus here has been to make sure that we have sufficient safety at the restart plan that we put forward.
We believe it does.
That's what the NRC has to determine in its evaluation and mostly where we go from there.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
I guess my follow-up would be in the Q you talk about the fact that you've been advised by Mitsubishi that a possible course of action would be the replacement of significant portions of the steam generator a process that could take more than 5 years.
What -- under what scenario would that potentially be something that you might pursue? Well I don't think we're really prepared at this point to try to speculate about those types of things.
I think really where we are right now is trying to get restart approval for the plan that we put place which as I said has sufficient safety margin around it.
Our next question comes from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.
Just a very quick question.
So just back on SONGS it just sounds like to me that the process could be delayed because of interveners and other people kind of filing appeals and is that of kind of what you're saying and could stretch into year end or a longer period? And is that where the concern is for you guys beyond obviously trying to get it restarted and the mechanical aspect of it? Yes.
I don't think that's the primary concern.
I don't think that helps the timing because it just ends up creating more work for the NRC staff to have to go through.
But the primary really determination here is a safety determination.
That's one that the staff makes.
So this issue regards a specific plant that has a safety issue.
So this is a matter for the technical staff to work through and they are.
Depending on what that answer is then we'll know where we are on that point.
The intervener piece and all of the other stuff that's been surrounding this I don't think is the central issue at this point.
I understand that's not the central issue.
That I definitely get.
But is it possible that various different parties through appeals and kind of the legal process of going through NRC approval could end up holding this up for a period of time? I guess anything is possible.
We outlined that or I outlined that in my remarks what some of those procedural things might be.
But I think at this point if things went kind of if I could put it this way typically then this is primarily a safety -- technical safety issue which the NRC staff would really come to its conclusion after it's gone through its analysis.
And I think all the other pieces are probably more things that happen in response to the process as opposed to the substance of the issue.
At any rate our primary focus right now is the safety determination.
And presumably we'll hear from the NRC on that in due course.
And our last question will come from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo.
LLC Research Division</strong> I had another question on SONGS.
If the decision is made to retire these units ultimately how should we think about the possible implications on capital spending? Would there be incremental spending needs? Would they be contemplated in the zip code comments you made previously about '14 to 6 -- or '15 to '17? Or would that be incremental? Neil this is Jim.
I think we're in the process of preparing our GRC and it's going to cover the periods '15 through '17.
And we'll contemplate in that process appropriate levels of capital expenditures.
And I think really the time frame for when you could see potential higher capital expenditures could be beyond that '15 through '17 period.
Because you've got confluence of events.
It could be SONGS.
You've got -- once your cooling-related features you have the other potential outages.
Though I think it's a little further out than the next year.
See -- I'll look over at Linda Sullivan and see if you agree.
She's agreeing with me.
And that was the last question.
I'll now turn the call back over to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone for joining us today.
And please call us if you have any follow-up questions.
Thank you and good afternoon.
This concludes today's conference.
Thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Good afternoon.
My name is Kelly and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Second Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks Kelly and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
We will be using the slide materials in our regular quarterly business update presentation that will be posted tomorrow on the website to support our ongoing investor discussions.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
[Operator Instructions] With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Today Edison International reported second quarter core earnings of $0.79 per share up from $0.56 per share last year.
As Jim will comment more fully quarterly comparisons to 2012 will not be that meaningful given the delay in receiving SCE's General Rate Case decision last year.
That said second quarter core earnings reflect strong operating results from higher authorized investment in our electric grid infrastructure good cost management and favorable tax benefits.
These results are consistent with the Edison International core earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 per share that we updated in June and are reaffirming today.
GAAP results include a $575 million pretax or $1.12 per share estimated impairment charge related to the shutdown of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station which we announced June 7.
Much of my commentary this afternoon will be on San Onofre.
Having made the shutdown decision SCE's focus for San Onofre has shifted to 3 key areas: First maintain our focus on safety as we transition the plant from operations to decommissioning it; second work with California regulators to plan for a reliable electric system without SONGS; and third resolve the issues of cost recovery raised in the CPUC Order Instituting Investigation or OII process consistent with our belief that our actions were prudent and reasonable.
As part of the cost recovery effort we are highly focused on securing recovery from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for its failure to provide functioning replacement steam generators that met their 20-year warranty and technical specifications.
Pursuing our insurance claim from NEIL will also be a major focus.
We are moving quickly to transition the work at SONGS including reducing staffing levels to reflect the shutdown decision.
On June 12 SCE filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission formal certification of permanent cessation of power operations at San Onofre.
On June 22 SCE filed its formal certification of permanent fuel removal from the reactors.
These are the first 2 steps in the long decommissioning process which is governed by Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules.
With the removal of fuel from the units we are transitioning from an operating license to a nuclear fuel possession license.
SCE is currently evaluating alternatives for accelerating the start of decommissioning.
We expect to complete the necessary site-specific cost study next year which will refine the current cost estimates and required timelines.
Until this detailed study is complete we have requested that the current funding levels for the decommissioning trust be maintained.
Limited funding for early stage decommissioning planning is available through the trust.
SCE intends to initiate the process shortly with the California Public Utilities Commission to access the trust for some decommissioning-related costs.
SCE continues to work with the California Independent System Operator the California Public Utilities Commission California Energy Commission and other stakeholders on the planning process for adequate and reliable resources of electricity post SONGS.
We are doing so against a backdrop of several state policies including shutting down or repowering coastal natural gas-fired generation due to once-through cooling requirements a 33% renewables mandate and the state's ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets under Assembly Bill 32.
There are a number of forums that have generated considerable discussion on generation transmission demand response and demand reduction and the role of new technologies in meeting future grid needs.
SCE will play an active role in shaping an informed set of policies and principles for continued grid reliability in Southern California.
Our plans remain focused on the wires-related investments while encouraging the use of competitive markets for new generations.
I'd like to elaborate on how we are aggressively pursuing third-party recovery of costs on behalf of our customers.
On July 18 SCE provided Mitsubishi Heavy Industries or MHI a formal notice of dispute.
This begins the process for initiating claims against MHI resulting from its supplying faulty replacement steam generators.
In the notice of dispute SCE alleges that MHI totally and fundamentally failed to deliver what it promised and that it was guilty of gross negligence.
We also alleged that the liability limitations in the contract do not apply.
We have chosen not to specify dollar amounts of damages at this time.
We will pursue recoveries aggressively on behalf of customers if our disputes with MHI cannot be resolved otherwise.
MHI has already publicly expressed its objections to these claims as would be expected.
Consistent with the contract terms we are now in a 90-day period for SCE and MHI to try to resolve these claims.
If MHI and SCE are unable to resolve their differences regarding liability SCE expects to initiate binding arbitration under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce rules in San Francisco.
This dispute resolution forum is also specified in the contract.
We expect MHI to step up to meet its obligations.
Pursuant to our rights under the outage insurance policy written by the Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited or NEIL SCE is pursuing claims for energy purchases from the market.
SCE expects the total claims under the NEIL outage policy will be $388 million in total with SCE's share $304 million although not all claims have yet been filed.
With the decision to shut down San Onofre SCE's claims under the policy are reduced.
We don't expect any decision from NEIL until late in the fourth quarter or sometime next year.
If the claims are denied in whole or in part SCE has recourse including nonbinding mediation and binding arbitration.
SCE continues to work with the California Public Utilities Commission comprehensive OII process to determine the appropriate cost recovery treatment for San Onofre.
The CPUC is in the process of scoping out the additional phases in the proceeding.
In fact a scoping memo was issued yesterday for Phase II which Jim will discuss more in his comments.
We will not be able to comment on the likelihood of any potential settlement which CPUC President Peevey urged parties to seek after our shutdown decision was announced.
I'd like to now turn to the drivers of long-term growth.
On July 15 we initiated the first phase of SCE's next rate case by delivering the Notice of Intent to the division of ratepayer advocates for our 2015 test year GRC.
The actual General Rate Case application is expected to be filed in the fourth quarter of this year.
The GRC strategy is consistent with what we've outlined for you previously.
We have proposed a modest increase of $120 million for 2015 representing a 1.2% increase over base rates and a 0.6% increase in total rates.
We have also proposed increases of $368 million in 2016 and $331 million in 2017.
Our request in this GRC cycle will emphasize the need to build on previous infrastructure improvement efforts.
Funding the needed increase in infrastructure investment while mitigating rate impacts requires striking the correct balance between reliability policy goals and affordable customer rates.
This means continuing our efforts to achieve efficiencies in our operating and maintenance costs.
Operational excellence is the framework we have established to deliver on our mission of providing safe reliable and affordable power to customers.
It is supported by one of our core values continuous improvement something in which our employees across the company are fully engaged.
For example we have significantly reduced our support staff to approximately 2006 levels.
We are reducing overhead spending in virtually every area.
While most of these reductions have been implemented in 2013 and are reflected in our 2013 earnings guidance we expect to continue cost improvements.
These improvements are included in our 2015 rate case allowing additional capacity for infrastructure investments without significantly impacting customer rates.
Our proposed capital spending plans together with updated forecasts for required FERC transmission investments steps up our expected rate base growth to a 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2013 through 2017.
Jim will review the details in his comments.
What I want to do is reiterate our intention to meet our capital spending needs without issuing equity and to moving our dividend back into the target payout range in steps over time.
These remain cornerstones of our investor value proposition for Edison International.
GRC cycle provides a transition path for SONGS costs as well.
For example to support ongoing O&amp;M costs at San Onofre we will transition to funding from our decommissioning trust and ramp down revenues collected from customers through the GRC.
This will need to be synchronized with the progress of the SONGS OII.
We expect to fine-tune requested levels next year as detailed analysis of operating and capital expenses in the shutdown period are completed.
We made a filing with the CPUC last week for example to move any O&amp;M savings resulting from shutdown into the ERRA balancing account we used to track purchase power costs.
If approved this will create customer bill offsets from the reductions in costs as we transition to the lower staffing levels appropriate for decommissioning.
This proposed treatment will allow us to reduce impacts on customer rates sooner and would not impact earnings.
These costs are subject to refund after review in the OII process.
I'd like to touch on one other topic related to capital investment.
The CPUC's recent decision to require undergrounding of a 3.5-mile 500 kV segment of the Tehachapi renewable transmission project through the city of Chino Hills.
We remain concerned about the potential precedent for future transmission line costs though we respect the commission's decision and we'll move forward to implement it expeditiously.
Next steps are to finalize some technical and scope questions with the PUC finalize the construction plans and file for rate recovery with FERC based on our estimated capital cost for the project completion.
Our estimate is higher than the estimate referenced in the CPUC decision.
Important to our ability to develop electric infrastructure while limiting rate impacts is rate design reform.
A better rate design remains an important long-term priority to ensure that costs for maintaining grid reliability and availability are fairly borne by all customers using the grid.
Especially important is the ability to recover fixed costs through a charge carried by all residential customers.
This is important because California policies encouraging residential rooftop solar are subsidizing those who install rooftop solar and shifting fixed costs to those who do not.
Assembly Bill 327 has bipartisan support and provides the CPUC the authority to reduce current subsidies between upper and lower-tier residential rates and allow overtime for a more meaningful monthly fixed charge of up to $10 per month.
Recovering fixed costs for the grid and the rates of all residential customers is important as the state moves towards a more distributed and smart grid model.
This is especially true since the grid facilitates and enables distributed energy resources and will require significant utility investment.
I'll finish with a brief comment on Edison Mission Energy.
As a result of last week's termination of the original settlement agreement we reached with EME and a majority of its noteholders we will now participate in the bankruptcy process seeking recovery of our claims as a creditor and could be a target of claims as well.
Our philosophy in the original agreement was to use tax benefits to address EME's liabilities to us and facilitate its reorganization if possible.
We do not believe we can justify doing more nor are we obligated to do so.
We have become aware of one of the many legal filings in the case made in the middle of last night on behalf of creditors which contains a number of allegations against us.
We believe these to be completely without merit.
There seems to be a contest for control in the bankruptcy and that we have been thrust into the middle of it.
Frankly it will be a shame if this kind of behavior is allowed to interfere with the principal purpose of the bankruptcy which is to successfully reorganize EME.
As a result of the bankruptcy process the investment in EME was written off last year and is no longer included in our operating results.
EME was and remains structurally separate from Edison International with all that implies.
We won't change that.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Jim? Thanks Ted and good afternoon everyone.
My comments will focus on the following topics: Second quarter earnings SCE's Notice of Intent or NOI filing for the 2015 General Rate Case updated capital expenditures and rate base forecast for 2013 through 2017 SONGS and earnings guidance.
Turning to Page 2 of the presentation.
Second quarter 2013 core earnings are $0.79 per share up $0.23 from last year.
SCE contributed $0.25 of their earnings growth.
The key drivers are shown on the right side of the slide.
As with the first quarter the largest earnings driver is the delay in the 2012 General Rate Case decision.
This timing item affected SCE's quarter-over-quarter comparisons by $0.16 per share.
You will recall that during 2012 before a final GRC decision was received we recorded revenues at 2011 authorized levels.
We also benefited $0.08 per share from higher revenues authorized for 2013.
As I mentioned last quarter the earnings benefit of rate base growth was offset by lower CPUC ROE of 10.45% in 2013 versus 11.5% last year.
On the cost side there are a number of items to mention.
The first is severance.
Severance accounting for employees who worked at SONGS is rather complicated.
Here's my plain English explanation.
During the second quarter of 2013 we accrued $56 million of severance.
Of this amount $24 million or $0.05 per share was offset by authorized SONGS revenue.
For the balance or $32 million we established a regulatory asset and we expect that this amount will be offset during the third quarter as we ramp down other expenses at the plant.
Because we believe the full amount of the $56 million will be recovered in rates this cost did not impact earnings.
Additionally for the quarter-over-quarter variance analysis we see the $0.05 of severance showing up this quarter and the balance will run through expense next quarter.
The severance for employees that indirectly support SONGS is accounted for differently.
Severance for the estimated 175 positions was accrued during the second quarter or $0.03 per share and will reduce earnings but will yield savings once these employees depart later this year.
As a reminder this severance was included as transition cost in our June guidance update.
The balance of severance or $0.03 a share relates to the operational excellence initiative Ted discussed and we'll have similar future benefits through 2014.
SONGS inspection and repair costs are $0.04 per share lower in the second quarter.
In addition we did not receive any warranty payments from MHI during the second quarter.
One last point on SONGS.
We are not showing any variance for removing SONGS rate base from earnings or from AFUDC on CWIP.
For the partial month of June these amounts were relatively small and offset by other items.
However these variances will show up next quarter.
The completed SmartConnect project had O&amp;M costs recorded in the balancing account in the second quarter of 2012 of about $0.04 resulting in a positive variance this quarter.
Depreciation is $0.03 per share higher from rate base growth.
Incremental tax benefits from repair deductions added $0.05 per share.
Year-over-year we continue to expect incremental tax benefits from Transmission &amp; Distribution repair deductions consistent with earnings guidance.
Income tax and other items netted to $0.02 per share benefit.
Edison International parent and other costs were $0.02 per share higher than last year as you can see on the left side of the chart.
This relates principally to quarter-over-quarter change in our consolidated income taxes.
In noncore items as Ted mentioned the SONGS impairment charge of $1.12 per share was within the disclosed range.
We also recorded a positive $0.04 per share in discontinued items as we continue to refine the estimated income tax impacts of the expected future separation of EME.
As Ted mentioned EME is in discontinued operations and is no longer consolidated as part of our results.
Together the core earnings non-core charge and discontinued operations tie to the basic and diluted EPS loss of $0.29 per share in the quarter.
Page 3 summarizes the year-to-date results and core earnings drivers.
I will not go into full reconciliation of year-to-date results because the explanation is very similar to the quarter.
Looking ahead to the third quarter the timing of the 2012 CPUC GRC decision will continue to result in positive variances over the last year and there will be a negative variances from the removal of SONGS from rate base and the elimination of AFUDC earnings from CWIP.
Page 4 summarizes many of the key points Ted has already made about the policy direction we're taking in the 2015 General Rate Case.
The Notice of Intent will go through a detailed review by the CPUC Division of Rate Payor Advocates.
Once the area is satisfied the filing is complete and deficiencies are cleared we will finalize a filing and update for any necessary changes.
We will file the application in the fourth quarter commence evidentiary hearings in the spring and target a decision for the fourth quarter of next year.
As we have previously mentioned the workforce reductions and other efficiency improvements will flow back to customers beginning January 1 2015.
Turning to Page 5 we've updated our capital investment forecast to show the profile we anticipate over the next 5 years.
The forecast shows the increase in distribution spending in 2015 consistent with our infrastructure reliability focus.
The chart shows that we expect to spend between $18 billion to $20 billion from 2013 through 2017.
It also reflects the expected moderation of FERC spending with 2 of our 3 major transmission projects nearing completion.
The forecast reflects a modest shift to the right with 2013 CapEx down about $200 million from our prior forecast.
This mainly reflects cost overruns on the 2 transmission projects going into service this year as well as timing of expenditures -- underruns sorry.
Over the 5-year period CPUC spending is 78% of the total -- the CPUC spending is 78% of the total and FERC is 22%.
Please note that we also have continued to provide a range case with 12% variability.
This is the average variability experienced between forecast and actual capital spending over the last 3 years.
Included in FERC capital spending is $360 million estimate for the undergrounding of the portion of the Tehachapi project that Ted discussed.
This is the estimate SCE provided to the CPUC and updated Tehachapi testimony earlier this year.
SCE assumes that this line is in service in 2016 and we expect the cost estimates and timing will be refined over time.
Additional updates on our 3 major transmission projects are in the presentation appendix.
On Page 6 we show the detail on the resulting rate base through 2017.
The forecast excludes SONGS rate base.
Ultimately Phase II of the OII process will determine what if any rate base will be used and useful.
We currently estimate about $400 million of SONGS property plant and equipment plus construction work in process would continue to support ongoing activities at the site.
On August 12 we will make an additional filing to the CPUC and it will contain rate base figures.
The capital expenditures provided on Page 5 yield a compound annual growth rate of 7% to 9% for the 2013 through 2017 period.
These numbers also reflect bonus depreciation in 2013 which is trued up in the 2015 GRC NOI.
Page 7 is an update of our FERC formula rate case proceeding.
As many of you are aware the FERC judge announced a settlement among the parties and that the settlement will be filed on or before August 16.
The terms of the settlement are confidential and will not be made public until this is filed with the FERC.
We will file an 8-K concurrent with the filing of the settlement so we can discuss the key terms with the market.
Please turn to Page 8.
We continue to provide updated summaries of key SONGS data and the details supporting our net investment.
Note that we have added a new category of SONGS severance cost related to shutdown decision.
These are the direct costs that I mentioned earlier and we expect to recover and not impact earnings.
In addition in the OII proceeding we have recommended that any excess of SONGS authorized O&amp;M over actual O&amp;M be returned to customers through the credit to our fuel and purchase power balancing account as Ted mentioned previously.
We do not anticipate that O&amp;M spending will decline meaning -- excuse me we do anticipate that O&amp;M spending will decline meaningfully over time as we transition to decommissioning and downsize staffing.
The fuel and purchase power balancing account is running and increasing under collection primarily from higher-than-forecast natural gas prices and replacement power for SONGS.
We are still working on a plan on how to -- we will transition from funding SONGS from base rates to decommissioning.
At a minimum we will need approvals from the CPUC and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to withdraw funds from a decommissioning trust.
On Page 9 we've updated one of the slides we used in the June 7 SONGS call to better reflect the items we considered in recording the impairment.
At the bottom of the slide we summarized the accounting treatment which moves the net investment into a regulatory asset less the pretax impairment charge of $575 million.
This charge is based on the required accounting determination.
As we have previously said we may take different positions in the SONGS OII process based on our view that our actions have been prudent and reasonable.
Based on our conversation with investors we have summarized the current status of the various OII phases on Page 10.
Note that this time the judge has not targeted a specific date for a proposed decision for Phase I but we expect it in the third quarter.
This includes the schedule for Phase II published yesterday by the CPUC.
The schedule calls for hearings in October and a final decision in February of next year.
One of the key points we made in the June 7 SONGS call was that the recovery precedent allowed return of capital in early shutdown scenarios but mixed results will return on capital.
We have tabulated those precedents for reference Pages 12 and 13 summarized for reference on Page 11.
Pages 12 and 13 summarized the key points that Ted made regarding potential recoveries from MHI for direct and consequential damages and from NEIL for replacement power.
Almost all of the potential NEIL replacement coverage falls within the 52-week period of maximum coverage.
The tail portion after 52 weeks is covered at 20%.
Also a coverage of 10% of costs may be available after permanent shutdown.
Page 14 provides a brief update on the decommissioning process that Ted also covered.
Given the permanent shutdown of SONGS we are now developing a detailed site-specific plan and cost estimates.
This detailed plan will not be completed until next year.
As a result we have asked the commission to continue the current decommissioning funding of $23 million a year until we can incorporate the detailed plan.
As shown on Page 15 we have reaffirmed our updated core earnings guidance from the June 7 SONGS update call.
We have updated our basic earnings per share guidance to reflect the second quarter noncore items.
Other than the amount we recorded for the impairment charge for SONGS versus the prior range we provided all of the guidance elements remain unchanged.
Page 16 also reaffirms our dividend policy which is to return to our targeted dividend range over time to 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings.
Ted and I have met with a number of investors over the last few months.
We have heard the importance you place on progress with the dividend as management and the board remain committed to delivering significant shareholder value from both attractive rate base and earnings growth and above-average dividend growth.
Thanks and I'd like to turn the call over for Q&amp;A to the operator.
[Operator Instructions] First question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Firstly Ted in your prepared remarks you said about the dividend that the plan was to increase it to the range that you said in steps and over time.
Can you give us any flavor as to how many steps and how long -- and how much time is the right way to think about this given the SONGS' sort of ongoing deliberations? So Jonathan it's obviously a question I understand people would like more specificity on as I think actually you and I talked about before as well.
The tricky part about either saying we're going to be at 50% by x year is it implied in any kind of a commitment along that line is you might find yourself having to either issue debt to increase the dividend or possibly even issue equity in order to maintain that target.
And we just feel that's imprudent that's not the right way to manage capital.
So that's why we say in steps over time.
And I think the intent obviously is to get back into the range get back into that range as soon as it is prudent.
We obviously have a few things bubbling on the stove here and we've got to figure out the most appropriate way to get back into that range.
So I can't be more clear at this point but we certainly don't expect it to be in one big jump and we don't expect to spend an excessive amount of time getting there.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And can I just start another topic? The -- obviously the CPUC approved Tehachapi but they think it's going to cost less than you're saying it's going to cost.
Can you -- I'm sorry if you covered this but I was cut off for a bit.
What -- how will it work? How will you resolve that difference? Are there risks associated with not recovering the actual costs? So Jonathan we're going to have Ron Litzinger cover that.
Yes Jonathan cost recovery is at FERC.
We will make our filings at FERC and we have to demonstrate prudency whatever it costs.
The public California PUC does like to put cost caps in their decisions but it's ultimately decided by FERC.
Research Division</strong> So that there is -- it doesn't matter essentially what the commission decided on costs that'll be determined by FERC based on your future filing? I think people look at the cost caps that the PUC has and it certainly begs questions.
So if we feel we need to file an advice letter with regards to the cost cap at an appropriate time after we get a little further along with the construction risk we face at Tehachapi we would file an advice letter just to clear up that question.
Next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> I'm just curious in terms of thinking about the risk reward around the settlement and the transmission the TO case.
I know that you haven't disclosed any of the information regarding what's in the detail of the formal settlement.
But just curious are you looking at a process where you could be coming back in every year where you're reviewing potential ROEs on FERC-regulated transmission? Are you looking to try and get more of some long-term certainty around that? Michael I'm sorry right now.
We -- I'd love to be able to get into the settlement but since it's subject to confidentiality I can't peel off a piece and give you a feel for how that was treated in the settlement process.
When we actually file the settlement which is expected around August 16 the full settlement will be in the public domain and we'll be happy to talk to you then.
So I got to beg off until we get that into the public domain.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Follow-on question related to EME if I go back in time and if I go back and recall whether it was NRG whether it was Mirant whether it was some of the bankruptcies on the merchant side that we've seen there wound up being significant cash payments made whether it was by Xcel or other companies to bondholder or creditor committees.
How do you think or how should investors think about the potential ramifications or impact of that for Edison International in the EME process? Well Michael you're going to get Jim's response redux.
I'll just say I chose my words carefully in my prepared remarks and those are really probably where we need to leave it at this point.
Lots -- it's the nature of the animal lots of these claims and counterclaims and all kinds of interesting tactics get used.
But at the end of the day as I said we think the claims or the allegations that were made in this latest filing are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend our approach.
I have to leave it there.
Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> You all mentioned that the scoping memo for Phase II of the OII called for a decision in February of next year.
And if I remember correctly that's only the second phase of a 4-phase process.
What are the prospects for settlement with interveners in the OII to be reached on an accelerated basis so that we don't have to wait through the end of '14 for a resolution? Yes Hugh this will be Ted again.
I guess I get to make all the responses where we don't respond.
But that's why I said in my script that although we're obviously aware that President Peevey and others have urged the parties to get together and consider settlement and bring that to the commission we really can't go into any discussion about that.
So there is an interest in it obviously on the part of the commission but that's about all we can really say on that point.
Otherwise meanwhile back at the ranch there is a schedule that is under the OII and that's what we're focused on at least publicly.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
My follow-up question is kind of a nitty-gritty question on NEIL insurance.
You seem to be making substantial claims under the outage policy but I believe you say here that you've not made claims under the property damage policy.
And I guess I just wanted to verify that.
And is there an ability to collect under the outage policy even if the loss to property is excluded from coverage under the property policy? Hugh it's Bob Adler.
We have delayed making a judgment about submissions under the property policy to this point in time.
It's not correct to say that we've decided not to make a submission.
So we have not yet determined that but we have been able to submit claims under the outage policy.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> That contention on the claim on the property policy because that's the point I wanted to clear up.
You can claim under the outage without claiming the property or is that...
Correct.
They are independent policies.
They're triggered by independent coverages and they have independent exclusions and inclusions.
Dan Eggers of Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Just changing pace a little bit if you look at the CapEx plan from the GRC there's a lot more distribution spending than you've had in the past.
Can you maybe share a little more color on where those monies are going and how much of that is tangibly visible today for explicit needs in the sense of in the past transmission investment had very clear projects associated with it? So Dan I'll give you a quick update and Ron will give you lots of detail because he is the policy witness for the company for the 2015 GRC.
To say it's tangible I think it would be very tangible to spending a lot of it and we can break it down for you.
When you get into the back part of the deck there'll be a pie chart that shows the distribution of capital spending in the various categories.
So we can get into a little bit more probably outside of this call.
But a lot of it a significant amount I can't quote you a percentage right off the top of my head is for what we call infrastructure replacement.
Those are poles transformers conduits you name it.
It's just we're stepping up the replacement level of our facilities given the age to get it closer to where we think we need to be so we can get on top of any kind of potential down-the-road reliability issues.
I'll pause there and look to Ron to fill in around it.
I think Jim has really captured the key point.
Our focus on the distribution system is on infrastructure replacement.
We need on almost all asset classes to get at or near what we call the equilibrium replacement rate which is sort of the population divided by the mean time to failure.
As our system ages we need to get to that rate to keep the system at the average age of the system less than that mean time to failure for reliability.
So we're making some significant step-ups in this particular rate case especially on poles as we go forward.
And that's what's driving it up primarily.
Yes it's on Page 23 of the deck when you have a chance to look at it Dan.
So infrastructure replacement is more than 50%.
It's almost 60% of the total distribution spending during the 5-year period.
The service connections represents about 10% to 15% load growth is about the same amount; general plan so that'll be facilities and IT-related activities.
So it's -- going back to the main point infrastructure replacement that's our way of saying maintain the reliability of the system that will be very tangible.
Research Division</strong> And I guess I don't know it's hard to talk to what the OII is going to look like.
But with such big claims outstanding both from your perspective of the MHI and then NEIL is there a way to work an agreement or looking at past precedent to work an agreement where the recovery number would be determined from the customer and then you'd net back proceeds? Or do you need to know -- have a better handle on what you're going to get from these other parties before you can figure out what the customers are going to pay for? Yes it's hard to speculate at this point in time.
I think what's going to happen we're going to go through a process and the commission is going to determine what's use and useful in this next phase in Phase II.
Phase III is the important one that's the prudence of our decision in and around the steam [ph] generator project and all the activities that supported that.
So I think that's the process that we will be going down and they'll determine in each one of those phases a decision leading up to the third phase which I think is the key because that's what will determine reasonableness.
But to speculate beyond that it's really hard to do it at this point in time.
The next question is from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.
LLC</strong> Just a question on the -- first on the rate base forecast.
You mentioned the bonus depreciation is in there and then the true-up for that.
Could you give a little more color on how that plays out through these numbers? I don't know if I have more color to give you besides we gave you the amount in our script in terms of what the bonus depreciation amount is reflected in the 2015 number.
So these numbers are reflective of it and I'll stop and pause and look at Linda Sullivan for further detail.
Right.
It's included in our Notice of Intent filing bonus depreciation and that is in the rate base numbers that are on this page.
LLC</strong> Can you give us that number though? Well we said $700 million.
$700 million is included in the NOI and about 85% of that was associated with the extension into 2013.
LLC</strong> Okay.
So just in terms of the way that flows through that's the bonus depreciation in '13 '14 or that's the true-up for that in '15 essentially? That's the true-up in '15.
Yes it wasn't reflected in '13 '14.
We didn't know about it so it can't be in rate.
So it's now picked up at 2015 Steve.
LLC</strong> Okay.
And then just on these -- the Edison Mission issues which I know you can't comment on in detail but just can you give us a sense on the process of this case and just when you would be in the process be responding? So Steve we'll have Bob Adler our General Counsel comment.
Well right now Steve the -- there has been a motion filed before the court for a -- for the creditors to take control of the potential claims against EIX.
That motion will be heard some time later in August.
And of course I wouldn't speculate about outcomes.
Currently I believe that Edison Mission has the exclusive reorganization rights into November as I recall.
And so that would be presuming the next up in the bankruptcy process itself after a resolution of this particular motion.
Does that answer your question? LLC</strong> Yes.
Will you be responding to what was filed last night as part of this motion? We have made a decision whether to respond to the motion.
But I want to make clear there's been no complaint filed against us.
There is a motion pending in court.
Paul Fremont of Jefferies.
Research Division</strong> I guess my first question looking at Page 9 of your slide presentation the authorized revenues and the replacement power don't seem to be part of the regulatory asset.
Is that because you're asking for recovery of that through the balancing accounts? Or what would be the venue to recover those? Okay.
So it's a good question Paul.
Thank you for picking it up.
The authorized revenue the $804 million here that we reflect on the Page 9 that has been previously recovered from customers and it's subject to refund as part of the OII process.
The replacement power so here you can see the $670 million that's been in a -- that sits in our ERRA or our fuel and purchase power balancing account and it would be subject to review in prudency by the Public Utilities Commission.
Thirdly is the net investment as you slide over to the right.
And we said back on June 7 when we announced that we were going to shut SONGS that the net investment is approximately $2.1 billion.
And what we did was we took the impairment that we announced today the $575 million pretax and reduced the original net investment by that amount the $575 million to come up with a regulatory asset of $1.5 million to $1 million [ph].
So there are 3 separate pieces to be clear and the commission will review each of these as part of the investigation process.
So I'll pause there and make sure we've got clarity here.
And if you have a follow-up please ask it.
Research Division</strong> Yes the follow-up question that I have is does the schedule in the scoping memo for Phase II imply that SONGS rate adjustments would occur commensurate with the final order in February of 2014? Or is that not clear based on what's out right now? Yes Phase II for clarity is looking at the question of what should continue as rate base what will be used and useful.
And that was in my script.
I commented at least based on the initial filing that we made last week that we will update on August 12 that we believe that there's about $400 million of net plant.
Not rate base net plant that would continue to be used and useful.
And so the commission is going to need to look at that and decide.
And so it affects ultimately the net investment number that we're talking about here and the regulatory asset that resides at the bottom of the page.
And ultimately remember for earnings purposes we pulled out the entire earnings on the entire $1.2 billion of rate base associated with SONGS.
So there's a lot of pieces it affects.
And Phase II should be recovered by February.
And again this is for interim rate treatment in Phase II.
Phase III if there's prudency issues it could come back and affect what happens in Phase II.
Research Division</strong> I'm still not clear I mean are any rate adjustments then contemplated as part of Phase II or not? So they'll look at rate adjustments on an interim basis.
So Phase I takes a look at 2012 and could have an interim decision but then that could be affected by ultimately what they decide in Phase III.
So -- and just like with rates you could pull certain costs out of rates and it will not be -- would no longer be used and useful and certain portions of our rate base would continue.
And they could adjust rates on an interim basis until they get to Phase III and they look at everything again.
I know it's confusing.
We're still working through the details as we understand it too.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So it would be like subject to refund.
In other words if you were -- if the costs were deemed to be prudent then you would essentially get that back? Yes I think that's a good way to think about it because per candles [ph] if that would -- put it in rates and they reserve the right to adjust it as part of Phase III.
The last question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith.
Research Division</strong> So first question here.
Obviously pretty successful on cost cutting here and it seems like moving forward on that front.
How do you feel now on executing on '14 cost cuts as you guys previously described on the SONGS update call a few weeks back? Well that's a good question.
And frankly we haven't put anything out there for discussion purposes yet.
I think we implied through our comments that with the workforce reductions that we've indicated and from things we previously said that there will be some tax benefits that flow into '14 that there will be earnings above the standard rate base model that we've talked about previously.
So you'll have growing O&amp;M savings from the workforce reductions where you don't have severance and you'll have what's not -- and just want to emphasize to you and thank you Scott for pointing that out the benefits we see from SONGS reductions and costs will not flow to earnings those are being captured.
Whatever benefit of -- arise from the difference between authorized rates and actual expenditures will flow to reduce fuel and purchase power under collections that we're experiencing right now.
And then I have to stop there.
And obviously rate base we expect to grow based on the numbers we gave you today.
That is what we have proposed with the CPUC.
Right.
Research Division</strong> Right.
But there is this separate and distinct cost cutting initiative underway at least from the last time you guys updated it it seemed like that would at least in part offset the reduction of rate base correct? I mean the -- and no change at least from that base [ph]? Yes there's no change so there's multiple different pieces here and you've got non-SONGS reductions in workforce you have SONGS reduction in workforce but that should not affect earnings on the SONGS piece.
And you have rate base growth and you tax benefits.
So those are the primary elements of -- as you're trying to look forward into '14.
Research Division</strong> Can you give us a flavor at least as to the tax element that you're alluding to what that could contribute potentially? We have not said -- we'll catch you in the first part of next year what that amount will be.
I think we had $50 million after tax for 2013.
We have not said what it's going to be in '14.
Operator? Okay sir.
I'll turn it back over to you now.
Great.
Thanks very much.
Thanks everyone for joining us.
And if you have any follow-up questions please don't hesitate to call us.
Thanks.
Good afternoon.
My name is Angela and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Third Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn over the call to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks Angela and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
We will be using the presentation in a more complete business update that will be posted tomorrow on our website.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ substantially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
[Operator Instructions] With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thanks Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Today Edison International reported solid third quarter core earnings of $1.42 per share up from $1 per share last year.
Keep in mind that year-over-year quarterly comparisons are somewhat skewed principally because of the delay in receiving the General Rate Case decision from the CPUC which dampened earnings last year.
That said third quarter core earnings for this year reflect the benefits of our continued cost management efforts and favorable tax benefits not anticipated in our original earnings guidance.
Importantly we are raising Edison International's 2013 core earnings guidance to $3.60 to $3.70 per share.
This replaces our previous guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 per share.
Jim will comment more fully on the quarter-over-quarter differences and guidance changes.
As I have said in previous earnings calls creating long-term value at Edison International involves 3 major efforts: Resolving uncertainties relating to our San Onofre nuclear plant and Edison Mission energy; growing our earnings and dividends; and preparing for transformative change in our industry.
I will comment on each of these in the remainder of my remarks.
In September the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or NRC finalized its inspection report which evaluated SCE's response to the NRC's Confirmatory Action Letter and address the remaining open items from the NRC Augmented Inspection Team report for the SONGS outage.
In its report the NRC pointed to flaws in the computer code and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries proprietary engineering models used to design the failed steam generators at SONGS.
As a result the NRC issued a Notice of Nonconformance with NRC regulations to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as the contractor.
And a preliminary white finding and apparent violation to SCE as the operator of SONGS.
It is not unusual for the NRC to cite the licensed operator even when problems are created by a vendor or contractor.
There were no penalties imposed on SCE by the NRC and SCE has submitted written comments to the NRC on the preliminary white finding.
We fully intend to hold Mitsubishi accountable for its failure to provide properly functioning steam generators and for the damage it has inflicted on our customers and our company.
On October 16 SCE submitted a request for arbitration to the International Chamber of Commerce for at least $4 billion in claims against Mitsubishi for damages that the SONGS owners have suffered.
These claims are consistent with those outlined in the July Notice of Dispute and include the new steam generators replacement power to serve our customers lost revenue and inspection repair and other related costs.
In the meantime the Order Instituting Investigation related to SONGS is continuing at the Public Utilities Commission.
On November 22 we will submit opening briefs for Phase 2 which addresses adjustments to rate base and interim-rate making.
The estimated timeline for a Phase 2 decision is the first quarter of 2014.
The schedule for Phase 3 which addresses prudency has not been set.
We are hopeful that the SONGS OII can be resolved next year.
Let me now turn to EME and the recently announced NRG transaction.
The NRG transaction is part of a plan sponsor agreement to which EIX is not a party.
The plan sponsor agreement contains term sheets for an EME plan of reorganization the details of which have not been provided to us or to the bankruptcy court.
As we have stated in the 10-Q we filed today we are reserving our right to support the plan oppose it and/or seek modifications to it.
Under the skeletal plan filed with the bankruptcy court if the sale to NRG is completed then a reorganized EME would be wound down but would retain the right to pursue claims against Edison International.
Likewise EIX will retain the right to assert its claims against EME.
In other words matters between EIX on the one hand and EME and the creditors on the other are reserved out of the NRG transaction and left to the plan of reorganization to be submitted and argued in accordance with applicable judicial processes.
If the litigation is pursued then presumably reorganized EME will need to reserve out of the NRG sale proceeds for our claims as well as the cost of litigation.
Edison International does not know if a complaint against it will ever be filed containing the allegations we saw claimed by the creditors' committee motion in August.
It would obviously be beneficial for all concerned if everything were wrapped up at once.
But if the complaint containing such allegations or other allegations is served we will defend ourselves vigorously.
We will not be intimidated by claims we don't think have merit.
Remember that as a result of the bankruptcy process the investment in EME was written off last year and EME is no longer included in our operating results.
EME was and remains structurally separate from Edison International.
We have presented more detail on these developments in our 10-Q filing.
Given that this involves matters that are pending in court and that many of the details related to us have not surfaced we don't intend to comment further at this time.
This brings me to how EIX management continues to focus on earnings and dividend growth as the primary means for enhancing the shareholder value for our investors.
Our forecast of capital expenditures produces a 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate in SCE's rate base through 2017.
This forecast is based on the 2015 General Rate Case Notice of Intent that was submitted in July along with updates to transmission investments.
In mid-November SCE plans to file the formal application for our 2015 General Rate Case.
We do not expect material changes from the Notice of Intent which demonstrated the need for long-term reliability investments.
I would like to emphasize our hope for timely review of the application and a decision to allow for implementation of new rates in January 2015.
We are working hard to resolve the key uncertainties facing our business while providing strong growth prospects through continued utility investment.
The additional cash flow generated from the past several years of increased investment and rate base is sufficient to support both future growth and dividend increases in steps over time back to our target payout ratio.
We believe this is the best formula for achieving shareholder value.
I've made the statement several times to investors that shifts in public policy coupled with advances in technology are combining to create transformative change in our industry.
Along these lines there have been some interesting developments recently particularly on the public policy front that I want to highlight.
Assembly Bill 327 was signed by the governor last month which addresses residential rate design renewable energy standards and net metering for distributed generation in California.
The bill starts to address some of the inequities in the current rate design by collapsing the number of residential rate tiers from 4 down to possibly 2 and allowing for up to $10 per month fixed charge.
The bill also sets the current 33% renewable requirement as a floor rather than as a cap.
Another provision directs the CPUC to develop a rate structure for net energy metering customers that considers the costs and benefits to all customers not just those with rooftop solar systems.
These provisions of AB 327 now moved to implementation before the CPUC in a formal rate-setting process.
SCE supported these needed changes to customer rates and worked with numerous stakeholders to get this bill passed.
SCE will be proposing its phase rate structure recommendations to the CPUC later this year.
We are hopeful that the first phase can be implemented next summer.
Another policy update is on energy storage.
In October the CPUC established a target for California's investor-owned utilities to install 1 325 megawatts of energy storage by 2020.
This policy decision is one of the first in the United States and was created to optimize the grid better integrate renewable resources and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
SCE's share is 580 megawatts and the policy allows for up to 50% to be utility owned.
The first solicitation under this new requirement will be in December 2014.
We expect this will be implemented as a mix of utility-owned and third party investment.
In October the CPUC hosted a meeting to explore future business models of the California investor-owned utilities.
I find it encouraging that the Commission is thinking about longer term strategies and regulatory models in our industry.
Ron Litzinger presented our perspective focusing on the need for infrastructure investment to transform the distribution grid from a radio system accommodating one-way flows of electricity to a more advanced and flexible system capable of two-way electrical flows.
Such a system is needed to better enable distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar electric transportation and energy storage.
As the utility of the future continues to unfold we intend to be at the forefront of that change providing the enabling capital and engineering know-how while working with stakeholders to manage the ratepayer impact of state and federal energy policies.
I see all of this as an exciting opportunity to create value for our customers and our shareholders through long-term growth and change.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thanks Ted and good afternoon.
My comments will focus on the following topics: Third quarter earnings updated capital expenditures and rate base forecast and our increased earnings guidance.
Turning to Page 2 of the presentation.
As Ted has already said third quarter 2013 core earnings are $1.42 per share up $0.42 from last year.
SCE contributed $0.35 of the earnings growth.
The key drivers are shown at the right side of the slide.
As with the first 2 quarters the largest earnings driver is the delay in the 2012 General Rate Case decision.
This timing item creates a quarter-over-quarter revenue difference of $0.29 per share.
You will recall that during 2012 before our final GRC decision was received we recorded revenues at 2011 authorized levels.
In addition as we have indicated in prior quarters SCE's earnings related to rate base growth are largely offset by the lower CPUC return on common equity.
To these comparisons this quarter the impact from SONGS is grouped into 1 category with a $0.02 net positive impact.
There are 2 main drivers here.
First a favorable reduction in O&amp;M as compared to the third quarter of last year when we incurred inspection and repair costs as part of our efforts to return the station to service.
With our June decision to permanently retire SONGS we obviously did not incur these costs during this quarter.
Second pending the outcome of the SONGS investigation at the CPUC we are no longer recording return on SONGS rate base as we indicated in the June -- in June with the updated guidance.
As we transition SONGS to decommissioning revenues and expenses recorded will be affected and will make period-over-period comparisons more difficult.
We have estimated the impacts of the main financial statement line items in this slide footnote.
The important point is that we continue to only record revenues for actual costs which are lower than GRC authorized revenues.
Actual costs do not include depreciation taxes or return.
O&amp;M savings excluding SONGS contributed $0.02 per share to earnings.
These savings include planned cost reductions from the implementation of the Edison SmartConnect digital meter program.
We also continue to benefit from O&amp;M savings related to organizational realignments that have taken place over the last several quarters.
Depreciation excluding SONGS increased $0.07 per share reflecting the impact of new investments.
This quarter net financing costs are $0.05 higher than last year primarily from financings that support rate-based growth in accordance with SCE's authorized capital structure.
AFUDC earnings are also included in this category.
These earnings are lower quarter-over-quarter due to lower AFUDC rate and construction work in process balances.
The last item is the $0.13 per share benefit from income taxes.
A majority of this relates to continued benefits from the prepared deductions that were highlighted in our guidance.
The other tax item is a $0.06 per share benefit of repair deductions from generation assets based on a new IRS guidance received during the third quarter.
Year-to-date we have recognized $0.16 of incremental repair deductions which is higher than the $0.15 for the year that we included in our original February guidance.
This is largely due to an increase in the amount of plant closings that qualifies repair deductions than we originally estimated.
I'll come back to this in the discussions of guidance.
Edison International parent and other costs produced a positive variance of $0.07 per share.
This relates primarily to an increase in consolidated state income taxes last year as we had to adjust our state apportionment factors based on declining EME revenues.
There were no non-core items from continuing operations in the quarter.
EME is reported as discontinued operation and is no longer consolidated as part of our results.
During the third quarter of 2013 we did record an $0.08 per share charge reflecting changes in our estimate of income taxes related to EME.
Together the core earnings and discontinued operations tie to the basic and diluted earnings up $1.34 per share for the quarter.
Page 3 summarizes the year-to-date results and core earnings drivers.
I will not go into the full reconciliation for year-to-date results because the explanation is similar to the quarter.
Turning to Page 4 we've updated our capital expenditure forecast.
2013 capital is expected to be near the bottom end of the original range due to lower costs on 2 transmission projects Devers-Colorado River and Eldorado-Ivanpah that are largely completed this year and a slower ramp-up of CPUC infrastructure replacement spending.
The revised range for 2013 to 2017 is $18.2 billion to $20.6 billion which is $300 million to $400 million higher than the August forecast.
The increases in the last 2 years is largely due to an updated cost estimates for the Coolwater-Lugo and West of Devers transmission projects.
These transmission projects which are shown on Page 5 have been in our forecast since 2011 when we received CPUC incentive approval for equipment rate base and abandoned plant recovery.
In conjunction with the recent CPUC Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity applications for both projects we've updated our capital estimates.
Also on Page 5 note that these costs do not yet reflect projects' scope increases related to FAA requirements related to the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project.
We will update these costs once a final decision is received from the CPUC.
Turning to Page 6.
Our rate base forecast remains the same except for the $200 million increase in 2017 for the previously mentioned transmission projects.
Rate base growth continues to be 7% to 9% compounded annually through 2017.
As a reminder this slide removes SONGS from all of 2013 and future years pending resolution of the OII process.
Now let's move to SONGS and the process recovery for the different cost components please turn to Slide 7.
As Ted mentioned SONGS investigation is well underway and we are currently in Phase 2.
Over the summer testimony was submitted on the treatment of rate base and materials and supplies as shown on Slide 8.
SCE's decision is that the used and useful portion of rate base or $425 million should receive a full return on the investment at our currently authorized 7.9% cost of capital.
The remainder or $733 million shall receive a reduced return of 5.54% for the weighted authorized cost of debt and preferred stock.
A final decision on this phase is expected in the first quarter of 2014.
Although the schedule has not yet been set for Phase 3 we continue to believe the SONGS OII can be completed by the end of 2014.
Additional slides covering the various cost categories and sources of recovery of costs are included in the appendix.
Please turn it to Slide 9.
We received the CPUC proposed decision on the 2013 forecast Energy Resource Recovery Account or ERRA.
This is the balancing account for fuel and purchase power.
I wanted to give an update on this because even though it does not impact earnings it does affect liquidity.
The utility is under collecting this year as we have not yet received decision on our 2013 ERRA application.
Currently we are $719 million under collected in this account and project to be about $1 billion under collected by year end.
The reason for the under collection is that current rates are set at 2012 levels and do not include increased market purchases to cover SONGS and higher power natural gas and greenhouse gas costs.
The proposed decision if approved would increase rates about $200 million.
It would also move $321 million originally estimated for SONGS replacement power to the SONGS balancing account for consideration without making a determination on rates movements.
In the 2014 filing we have recommended a 2-year amortization of the 2013 under collection to moderate the impact on customer rates.
A decision on the 2014 ERRA filing is expected by the first quarter of 2014.
Finally we are financing the under collection with short-term borrowings.
Now let's discuss our updated earnings guidance on Slide 10.
We have increased our core earnings guidance by $0.30 per share to a new range of $3.60 to $3.70 per share.
We have also updated our key guidance assumptions.
I think it's easier to walk through how 2013 guidance has evolved.
Let's turn to Page 11.
When we gave 2013 guidance in late February we used our simplified earnings model for SCE and identified the potential for $0.31 of upside from repair deductions O&amp;M savings and energy efficiency.
Concurrent with the SONGS shutdown announcement in June we lowered core guidance by $0.20 per share.
This action incorporated lower debt preferred and common equity and AFUDC earnings and other transition costs.
All those elements remain in effect.
Today's guidance increases -- increase reflects 2 items.
First our operating expenses and other miscellaneous items.
With continued strong cost management we forecast an additional $0.10 per share benefit bringing the total to $0.23 for the full year.
As we said in February the cost savings will flow through the customers and are embedded in our 2015 General Rate Case.
Second our tax benefits.
Tax benefits relate primarily to property-related deductions including updated estimates of completed projects that qualify for repairs for tax purposes and cost of removal deductions and new tax guidance for generation-related repairs as I previously mentioned.
Together we see this increasing our full year benefit by $0.30 per share on a core earnings basis.
We have reaffirmed our parent company and other costs at $0.15 per share for the year yielding an updated core EPS guidance in the midpoint of $3.65 per share which we have ranged to $3.60 to $3.70 per share in our formal guidance.
We anticipate providing 2014 earnings guidance when we report full year results in late February of next year.
Thanks.
And now I'll turn the call over to the operator to take questions.
[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Dan Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Jim I -- just following up on that -- the O&amp;M question or the O&amp;M trajectory.
Can you talk a little bit about how the better savings are coming together where you guys are finding the benefits? What carry-through that -- should have into the ‘14 expectations as you kind of look at maybe some run rate savings and then how the GRC is recalibrated if you guys remain successful in doing better than planned as you've done this year? Okay.
So just taking ‘14 -- I'll do it in reverse order.
We said all along you should look to our rate base growth so I used the simplified model.
And there will be O&amp;M and tax benefits that flow into ‘14 but we haven't made any projections of what those numbers will be.
And I think we've said that the tax benefits will be less in ‘14.
And we'll have to update those based on what we're seeing as we flow through ‘13.
And again we won't make any estimates of what our guidance will be for ‘14 until February.
But I think it's the best model you can use is the simplified approach using the rate base model.
Especially as you push out to ‘15 which all the tax benefits and the O&amp;M reductions should flow back to customers and be picked up as part of the rate case process.
So using that simplified approach is the soundest way to project earnings beyond ‘14.
Going back to ‘13 now we've said there's $0.23 of operating expense savings as you can see in the key assumptions in our guidance page.
And what's driving this clearly we're seeing some benefits flowing through from some of the cost reductions we have undertaken through the course the first 3 quarters of this year.
Some of that has been masked too because we've had a number -- amounts -- a significant amount of severance-related expenditures that as you work through the reductions have slowed now as you get into the third quarter we have fewer anticipated for the fourth quarter.
So now you'll see the benefit of the cost reductions coming through.
And I'll pause and look at Linda or Ron if they want to add anything to the answer.
Anything? I mean our O&amp;M cost reductions largely 3 areas.
SmartConnect flowed through this year reduction in meter readers and field service reps.
The bulk of it has been reductions in our overhead or staff functions and then there's been the San Onofre reductions as well.
We continue to benchmark ourselves against the industry on an O&amp;M dollar per customer benchmark.
We continue to identify potential savings but known savings as Jim said are reflected in our 2015 rate case filing.
Do you want to follow-up Dan? Research Division</strong> Yes.
And I guess just on the CapEx program and the kind of the mix of transmission and distribution with the higher level of distribution and the forward plan now how visible is the distribution spending as you look out to ‘15 ‘16 and ‘17? And how do you guys plan to manage that with the Commission to make sure you get as good of a yield on CapEx as you have in the last rate case? Yes I'll take that first and I'll let Ron and Linda provide a little bit more detail.
So distribution is ramping up and it's primarily in 2 areas.
It's infrastructure replacement and pole loading.
So we're doing more based on the age of the infrastructure.
And in our General Rate Case proceeding the rationale or the reasoning for this is all laid out in the testimony.
And the challenge is to ramp-up and part of what we said for ‘13 is because of the increased spending in distribution and a number of items we have to do is having the manpower in order to achieve these capital expenditures increases.
So I'll pause there and let Ron and Linda add anything to that.
The bulk of the increase from our past infrastructure replacement levels is the pole loading program that Jim noted.
In addition to the normal pole deterioration we see with the large influx of additional telecom attachments we need to replace poles to address the loading on the poles.
And so we have ramped that up to a level that's consistent with our long-range replacement target for poles the level that we feel we need to be at to stay in equilibrium.
So it's the first asset that we've ramped up and achieved that on in this rate case.
And we're just going to continue ramping up our infrastructure replacements to be more consistent with the age of our assets.
Dan this is Scott.
Just one other comment everything that Jim and Ron have spoken about were factors that were included in our presentation for CapEx.
Previously the changes that Jim alluded to this quarter were largely related to updated transmission project cost estimates for 2 specific projects.
Yes.
We had put in preliminary estimates for West of Devers and Coolwater-Lugo from several years ago.
And now that we're going formally into the licensing phase we've updated those costs.
Next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> On SONGS and timing and the OII I think it was your comment Jim you were confident you could wrap like the whole thing up during 2014.
And then you were speaking to being in Phase 2 but I think the really broader comment was about the whole OII.
Yes I think I've been indicating consistently that we hope to get it through by the end of 2014 so essentially leave the bulk of the proceedings which is the Phase 3 for the balance of 2014.
So that's just a hope or an expectation.
Research Division</strong> And what are your hopes of being able to maybe get to accelerated resolution? I can't go there but we're just going to go through the process and keep on track in terms of what the Commission has established for the proceeding.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then on a -- to a different topic.
Could you just -- I have no chance to see all the filings but where do you stand on equity ratio currently? And should we think of these benefits that you're having in some of which will flow through and then others weren't as something that's going to just help to build a little equity cushion? It can it does have that effect.
We're at 49.5 as of September 30.
And so that's the 13 month basis obviously.
And we do use short-term debt at times to moderate the impact.
And so again just kind of hidden in your question is we have no plans to issue equity if that's what you're alluding to.
So we're going to manage this based on what we know and we'll watch our capital expenditures and we'll use short-term debt and we'll take that all into consideration and how we're trying to moderate the need for potential capital financing.
Research Division</strong> Again my question probably was more accurately on how much headroom do you think you have? We do have some.
And again this is all we're looking out well into the next couple of years as we look at that number.
So we'll bounce around based on how we do long-term financings how we use short-term debt and what the earnings will be going forward.
Research Division</strong> So some is the answer? Yes it has an impact.
Next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Research Division</strong> So you alluded to on the call earlier some of the energy storage possibilities that are I suppose coming to fruition perhaps next year.
If you could talk about what the rate base potential is.
You talked about I suppose 500 and change megawatts 50% rate baseable what kind of an investment could that translate to ultimately? Just let me start here because we haven't put out anything in our -- in the General Rate Case proceeding.
It does not include anything at this time related to the storage potential.
So we're going to evaluate it and consider what's there but it's premature I would say.
And I'll let Ron fill in here to suggest what the earnings potential might be from that.
No that's right Jim.
We're taking a look at the decision.
We're primarily interested on the distribution side that would go through the rate case process.
And on the transmission side for energy storage we haven't made a decision.
We're still evaluating and estimating what if any capital we would look out on the transmission side.
Research Division</strong> Got you.
And then just looking at the rates in here in the discussion ongoing I mean when do you look for something out of the CPUC as far as addressing and reconciling the issue? Is that related to the storage? I missed those.
Research Division</strong> Sorry with regards to the DG and the legislation in the quarter.
Oh the 327.
The Commission right now is working on a schedule.
And then I don't know if it's public.
Ron could you comment? I don't think so.
I don't think there's a schedule out yet.
From what we're hearing it's going to be sooner rather than later.
So they're trying to move it along as rapidly as possible so we could hopefully incorporate it in rates.
It could go into effect in ‘14.
So summer of ‘15 -- summer of ‘14.
Summer of ‘14.
Next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> First question just -- can you remind us again you -- every call you alluded to us that one of the key drivers for you is ramping up the dividend.
You've also told us your range for payout and you're below that.
When I look at the different things going on your CapEx ramps I think 2016 is the peak year according to your schedule.
You got the GRC case most of next year and of course the SONGS issue.
Can you just again prioritize to us how you look at these issues in terms of how that will influence the dividend? And when at the earliest should we think of you getting into that range that we've been seeing for the last several years? Well Ali they've dubbed me the one to answer that question.
This as Ted how are you? I don't think we will attempt to provide any kind of a schedule for when we would get back into the 45% to 55% payout ratio.
What we have said is that we believe we'll be able to move our way back to that 45% to 55% target in steps over time.
And in order to do that that means you have to have a dividend rate increase that's greater than your earnings rate increase.
So I think that gives you some sense of how we would at least see the trajectory to get there.
But we won't provide a specific target date for getting back into that target zone.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Ted fair enough.
But just to prioritize or at least the way you think about it between the CapEx timing SONGS resolution GRC can you just give us a sense of how you think about what's more important than the other as you're thinking through this conceptually? I don't know that I could say what thing is more important than the other.
I mean frankly a lot will depend on how these things evolve.
But I think you put your finger on some of the key considerations.
The part that I think is most important to reemphasize is because of the substantial investments that we've made over the last several years we have a much larger rate base which is producing much larger cash flows.
And now we really see our CapEx kind of leveling out albeit at a high rate but leveling out not continuing to increase.
So we're kind of in this roughly $4-billion-or-so zone per year in CapEx.
So with the growing rate base and a level annual CapEx that produces substantially more cash which allows us to get back to our target payout ratio on dividends.
Yes.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I was just going to say my second question you've talked about and you've shown that your rate base numbers in the back end have actually gone up slightly because of the transmission CapEx.
Are there any scenarios in which any of those projects could be in jeopardy because of the cost overruns? I mean is there a scenario where we may have to actually reduce the rate base numbers as we look out the next year through ‘17? Well again it kind of gets into the specifics of each one.
If you could take Tehachapi as an example.
A big chunk of that increase of course came from a Commission order on Chino Hills to underground the 3.5-mile section.
So I think we look at that as that's what's been ordered by the Commission it certainty will be important from a FERC approval standpoint.
So it's a host of things that affect the costs.
In some cases we've actually come in on budget indeed a little bit below budget and on time on some of these transmission projects the ones that were just completed here.
So it's a mix and that's kind of what you would expect.
Some things will be a little bit higher some things will be a little bit lower but I think in general we're in the zone of what we have projected previously.
Next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> A couple of items and I'll touch on them in order and then I'll be quiet.
One can you talk about the potential investment on the transmission side related to either the SONGS retirement or the retirement of the 6-plus gigawatts of gas generation capacity in California that must meet some of the cooling water regulation? That's question one.
Question two right after you announced the SONGS retirement the commissioners put out a release basically implying their desire for an expedited resolution settlement et cetera.
Have the commissioners themselves either in ex-partake talks or in other done any follow-up in a similar vein related to that initial release? I think it came out by the commissioners literally within a week or so after your retirement announcement.
Okay let me take the first question.
There is a potential for capital expenditures based on the retirement of SONGS and once-through cooling plants.
We are looking at that but I think it's premature Michael to try to put some numbers out there.
So I would feel uncomfortable should you not -- just throwing some numbers out.
We've got some large transmission projects that we're working on at Coolwater-Lugo and the West of Devers projects that are primarily for renewable support.
But we are looking as part of the SONGS shutdown and how we're going to replace SONGS what the steps might be to replace that.
And it's going to be a host of different things.
It's going to be energy efficiency it's going to be DG there could be additional transmission upgrades.
So we're looking at the gamut along with a large group of folks from the ISO and the CPUC and other stakeholders determining what's appropriate.
And clearly we're looking at it as a package you don't look at it as -- in isolation.
You have to take a look at all these things so you can plan accordingly.
I'll pause there and look back to Ron before I answer the second question.
In the state agencies the Energy Commission PUC they put a strong emphasis on what they call preferred resources in Orange County which are distributed generation energy efficiency and the like that Jim had mentioned.
So we have a strong focus on how do we facilitate that through distribution investment would be the primary area there.
What it comes down to with the once-through cooling and the SONGS retirement is where does the replacement generation get located.
If the bulk of it were to be in the Los Angeles basin the amount of transmission upgrades would be fairly minimal.
If a significant portion is located out of the basin the transmission needs would go up.
As part of the review process there's been several potential projects thrown about but none of those have been formally incorporated into the Cal ISO planning process as of yet.
Going back to the second question Michael.
We have obviously heard the commission's comments and we've read about similar comments and various analyst reports that have been out over the last couple of months.
And I'll stay we won't go beyond just acknowledging that we've read that.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
One thing on the transmission your neighbor in San Diego has actually put out a slide deck for the Cal ISO.
They outlined 4 projects the smallest of which was $1.6 billion or so the largest of which was close to $4.5 billion $5 billion.
I was under the impression that SoCalEd would have to make similar type of high-level disclosures to the ISO for transmission is that correct? And if so when would you likely have to start putting kind of more firm estimates around potential alternatives that the ISO could evaluate? It would be in the next ISO formal planning process which I think is about to begin shortly.
I don't remember the precise date but it's coming up and we'll have to outline our potential projects as well.
Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Research Division</strong> It looks as if a level of short-term debt is -- has been accelerating so it looks like it's about $1 350 000 000.
Is that primarily due to the purchase power under recovery or what other reasons might there be for the short-term debt to be going up? Good question Paul.
The short-term debt will ebb and flow on a variety of different reasons.
Partly the balances we were carrying before had to do with the under collections in our fuel and purchase power.
However we're also over collected in other accounts.
Also we did a large financing recently with $1.6 billion and the proceeds some of it was to refinance some upcoming maturities and some of it was new money.
So the short-term debt will ebb and flow based on the timing of financings and what we're seeing for our under collections and over collections.
So you can't -- it's not all tied directly to the fuel and purchase power situation that we've got right now.
Research Division</strong> And you've estimated sort of an under collected position this year for fuel and purchase power of $1 billion yet.
At the current rates that are in place would there be sort of a similar under collected amount next year? Well it depends on the timing of the rate proceedings because there's 2 separate ones.
There's a 2013 ERRA proceedings that would increase rates and then there's the 2014 proceeding which would increase rates.
And the timing of those would impact the ramp-up of potential short-term borrowings.
But we'd expect the Commission to render decisions in this because they know the importance of getting these done in a timely basis.
The hang up has been the crossover with the SONGS proceeding.
So the short-term debt and the under collected balance that doesn't relate directly to short-term debt is going up about $100 million a month based on current rates.
And then you have to look at all the other factors to see what the short-term borrowing implications might be.
Next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> My question was around AB 327.
The legislation seems to create a lot of latitude for the Commission to revise the tiering structure of the rates to revise the tariff for net energy metering.
My question was what are your objectives vis-à-vis the Commission for the rate structure for net energy metering and why are those objectives important to the company? Okay Ted's going to take that one Hugh.
I think in the broadest sense the objective is to try to have a rate structure that eliminates some of the inequalities that the current rate structure has.
So for instance in the current tiering you have higher use customers really picking up the bulk of increased infrastructure investments and other policy-related increases in costs while the lower-use customers are largely immune from those cost pressures.
As a result we now have a good $0.20 or more separating the low-use customers from the high-use customers.
And really the bulk of the burden landing on the high-use customers.
We estimate roughly speaking that about $650 million a year is being shifted from low-use customers onto the high-use customers or said differently the high-use customers are subsidizing the low-use customers to about $650 million a year.
So that's one of the things that the AB 327 seeks to address is providing the opportunity for the tiers to be reduced in number and the differential between the tiers also potentially reduced.
Second part is I think equally or more important than that is increasingly as distributed energy resources find their way into the distribution system you have more and more of the fixed cost of the system really being avoided and that needs to be addressed.
So -- and that's one of the inequalities.
We really feel that everybody that makes use of the grid whether they are pulling electricity directly from it or whether they are using it as a backup resource or what have you that that's an important resource that needs to be -- the costs needs to be shared by all users.
Said a little differently the distribution system really enables the distributed energy resources and so that's a cost that everybody should participate in.
So that's what the fixed cost seeks to address.
I think those are the principal issues that drew us to support the legislation.
And certainly the author Henry Perea biggest issue he had was really this cost shifting.
And a lot of that ends up impacting the lower income customers.
Just -- Hugh to follow-on the net energy metering there's a subsequent work that needs to be done on that.
The legislation really didn't directly affect that and the Commission's doing some work now to try to determine the impact of net energy metering.
And there could be some subsequent work by the Commission that follows up on that.
They need a new tariff by 2017 and the direction they gave for the new tariff was to look at how the benefits and costs are shared amongst all customers rather than just the distributed generation customers.
LLC.
Research Division</strong> Right.
Could I trouble you just to comment quickly on what are the mileposts that we can use to monitor the progress on the MHI arbitration if any and similarly on the NEIL insurance collections? Hugh really on the EME stuff we're really going to stay...
MHI.
MHI Excuse me.
On MHI stuff we're really going to -- thinking litigation and arbitration here sorry about that.
We're going to really stay away from trying to speculate on exactly what goes what those time tables or milestones would be.
I mean right now as we said in the comments we just have issued our arbitration notice and so we've got that to get through and then we'll see where that takes us from there.
Next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
My questions have been answered.
Next question comes from Kit Konolige with BGC.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Most of my questions have been answered.
Just wanted to refresh my memory.
I think in the past you've talked about -- in the OII for SONGS about Phase 3 being really the most critical of those phases.
Is that -- am I remembering correctly? You got it right Kit.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay good.
That's simple enough.
And Jim what -- do you have some idea when Phase 3 might be started when there could be filings in that? Is it sequential after Phase 2 is done then Phase 3 starts? That's how they did Phase 2 but they've been going on well almost concurrently to a certain degree.
So they haven't put out anything Kit.
We would expect it would occur sometime in 2014 and we'd hope they get through it by the end of 2014.
So that's what we've been consistently saying so let's see what the Commission actually does.
Next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
So as we're approaching December and in December your Board of Directors usually reevaluates your dividends.
And as you say that you have plenty of flexibility on the debt side to finance any carrying cost of the underfunded replacement power costs what should we expect for the dividend increase? Ted's going to take it tackle that one again.
Angie we really can't speculate on that at this point.
; That's it? Not even an attempt to answer the question? If you could just be in the room you'd see my nice smile.
I really -- we really can't discuss it at this point.
That was the last question.
I would now like to turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thank you everyone for participating today and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any follow-up questions.
Thank you.
Thank you for your participation in today's conference.
Please disconnect at this time.
Good afternoon my name is Shirley [ph] and I will be your conference operator today.
At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Fourth Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions].
Today's call is being recorded and I would now like to turn call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin.
Thanks Shirley and good afternoon everyone.
We apologize for the short delay on the start of the call.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-K are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.

Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
When we get to Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
If you have further questions please return to the queue.
With that I'll now turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Today Edison International reported full year quarter earnings of $3.80 $0.10 above the high end of our earnings guidance range.
Core earnings for 2013 were down slightly from last year's $3.92 per share reflecting in part the impact of closing the San Onofre nuclear plant.
We also introduced 2014 earnings guidance core earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share.
Jim will provide additional information on all of this shortly.
In the last several investor calls my remarks have centered on our three key strategic priorities; delivering long term growth in earnings and dividends resolving the uncertainties of EME and SONGS and positioning our company to capitalize on transformative change in our industry.
Today I will mostly touch on the subjects of our growth prospects and resolving uncertainties where there have been several developments.
For the last several years at Southern California Edison we have had the twin objectives of stepping up our infrastructure investments to maintain reliability and modernize the grid and providing cost benefits to rate payers through operational efficiencies.
This continued focus on keeping rates affordable and fair for all of our customers while investing in the grid has also provided strong earnings power for our investors.
This is demonstrated by our stronger than forecast core earnings in 2013 and by our decision last December to increase the common stock dividend for the 10th year in a row to an annual rate of $1.42 per share.
SCE continues to target high levels of infrastructure replacement and reliability investments while meeting public policy requirements.
In our 2015 general rate case application pending before the CPUC our testimony reflects a significant increase in infrastructure replacement activity for the 2015 to 2017 rate cycle.
This investment is primarily aimed at our distribution system.
The rate case application also forecast a need for sustained investment at these levels out through 2020 and beyond.
Therefore we continue to anticipate significant rate base growth for the foreseeable future.
Our updated forecast has not changed materially and SCE continues to forecast a rate base of between $27 billion and $29 billion by 2017 and a growth rate of 7% to 9% annually through this period.
Not yet knowing the outcome of the CPUC proceeding on SONGS this forecast continues to exclude any rate base contribution from our investment this forecast continues to exclude any rate base contribution from our investment in SONGS.
As for the DRC proceeding itself the CPUC is in the early procedural stages and we continue to respond to information requests from interveners.
We expect evidentiary hearings to be scheduled for the summer.
But the CPUC has yet to set the exact schedule.
A key initiative in 2013 involved in the coal reform and customer rate design which was meaningfully advanced with the passage of California's assembly bill 327.
This law returned authority to the CPUC to adjust rate design including a fixed charge and simplifying the tiered residential rate structure.
We are in the early stages but this law provides an opportunity to reduce subsidies and costs shifting amongst residential rate payers along with simplifying the rate structures.
All of these actions help provide the regulatory underpinning to support long term earnings growth while maintaining the impact of higher rates while managing the impact of higher rates on our customers; and in turn they help support our dividend policy which is a targeted pay out ratio of 45% to 55% of FCE earnings.
We continue to see the opportunity and steps over time to return the dividend pay out back to this target ratio.
While we are mindful of pending regulatory uncertainties we believe the opportunity for meaningful dividend growth remains an important element of the Edison International investment pieces.
Let me now turn to our efforts to resolve uncertainties; last week of course we announced a settlement agreement which we believe will provide the resolution to a key uncertainty for investors the EME bankruptcy.
As you heard during last week's call the agreement will settle all outstanding matters with EME and its creditors.
The agreement provides the opportunity for a cash flow positive outcome and honors our commitment to not put new capital into EME.
On February 19 EME sought approval of the bankruptcy to amend its plan of reorganization to include the settlement and to give notice to the creditors regarding the plan change.
The court approved giving notice to the creditors and rescheduled its conformation hearing on the plan to March 11.
Subject to approval of the bankruptcy court implementation of the plan of reorganization will allow EME to proceed with the sale to substantiate all of its assets to NRG and close on our settlement agreement.
This leaves one major uncertainty to resolve the recovery of our costs related to SONGS.
We continue to express to the CPUC our strong interest in having it complete its four phase regulatory review this year.
We are hopeful that our concerns with the phase one proposed decision will be addressed such that the commission can complete action on this stage and move on to the remaining phases in the not too distant future.
We anticipate in the first quarter a proposed decision on the second phase which addresses recovery of investment in SONGS.
We also anticipate a proposed schedule for the third phase which will cover the broad questions of reasonableness and prudency around our actions and those of the supplier of the faulty steam generators Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
We continue to assert that the steam generator tube leak that occurred after only 11 months of operating time and the resulting damages represent a total and fundamental failure of performance by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
We must insist that MHI be held accountable for its failure to provide properly functioning steam generators and for the damage it has inflicted on our customers and our company.
Simply put they should stand behind their product.
Southern California Edison has filed for significant claims against MHI for damages in the International Chamber of Commerce Arbitration process.
We will also continue to push aggressively to seek a federal will [ph] determination from NEIL the nuclear industry insurer for our outage related power purchase claims.
Recent conversations with NEIL lead us to expect their initial determination after their board meets in mid-June.
Along with the resolution of the SONGS OII we are planning for the replacement resources required to ensure grid's reliability without SONGS and for the safe and efficient decommissioning of SONGS.
With the assistance of third party experts we are developing an updated site-specific decommissioning plan.
This plan is expected to be completed by midyear.
Also we are creating appropriate channels for public participation to ensure an open and transparent decommissioning planning process.
Although it wasn't one of our two critical uncertainties we are pleased SCE was able to complete the sale of its interest in the Four Corners coal-fired generation facility in late December to Arizona Public Service for $181 million.
The transaction benefits our customers and meets an important California requirement to discontinue investments in generation not meeting stringent greenhouse gas emission performance standards.
It has no earnings impact on Southern California Edison.
So with that let me now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thanks Ted and good afternoon everyone.
My comments focus on the following topics; financial results updates on capital spending rate base on fuel and purchase power and 2014 earnings guidance.
Please turn to page 2; for the fourth quarter of 2013 core earnings are $0.81 per share.
The comparison to the fourth quarter last year is not particularly helpful because SCE's 2012 CPUC general rate case decision was recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.
The quarter-over-quarter comparison is summarized at the right of the slide.
The earnings drivers are the same things we have been discussing all year.
For SCE&lt; the year-over-year comparison is more informative.
Before I go there I want to comment on fourth quarter results at the holding company.
EIX recorded $0.02 per share of earnings $0.08 better than last year largely due to $0.06 per share of higher earnings from Edison Capital.
As we had previously mentioned Edison Capital has a small investment portfolio including affordable housing investments.
This portfolio con to wind down and periodically we will record income from sales or distributions.
It is difficult to predict the timing and amount of income from the remaining portfolio and we have not and will not include any income in our guidance numbers.
As a reminder holding company costs generally run a bit more than $0.01 per month.
In addition to the Edison Capital income the holding company also had $0.02 per share of lower cost in taxes.
A non-core item of $0.11 per share in discontinued operations is from Edison Mission Energy for ongoing adjustments to income taxes.
As a result we moved the accounting for EME to discontinued operations following its bankruptcy filed in the fourth quarter of 2012.
For the end of 2013 we now have recorded $70 million from adjustments related to the outcome of the EME bankruptcy including estimated retained tax benefits from the deconsolidation of EME for tax purposes.
As we have reported last week in our EME Settlement conference call we expect to record an additional $130 million during the first quarter of 2014 assuming the bankruptcy court approves EME's amended Plan of Reorganization.
Together this adds up to the estimated $200 million of income EME settlement is expected to produce.
I'd also like to note that based on our updated disclosures we have recorded $290 million of joint tax and $35 million of joint pension liabilities for a total of $325 million as of December 31 2013.
Under the settlement agreement we would also assume certain executive retirement obligations.
In total we have estimated these liabilities would be approximately $315 million as of the closing.
Please turn to page 3; as Ted has already mentioned EIX's 2013 core earnings are $3.80 per share.
On a year-over-year basis this is slightly behind last year SONGS accounts for most of the difference because we stopped recording a full return on investment and related AFUDC earnings since the shutdown decision was made.
The other major reason for the decline is a reduction in income tax benefits in 2013 compared to 2012.
The increased earnings from rate base growth in 2013 were offset by the lower CPUC authorized return on common equity.
To make it helpful in comparing full year results with our updated guidance from the third quarter call we have added a slide on page 4 to highlight the changes.
On full year core results came in -- our full year core results came in $0.15 per share above the midpoint of the guidance that we last updated on October 29.
$0.08 per share improvement is largely cost savings at SCE.
Holding Company results are better by $0.07 per share largely from Edison Capital earnings that were not included in our guidance and were booked in the fourth quarter.
One last point I'd like to emphasize is the track record of rate base and earnings growth that SCE has achieved over the last several years.
Please turn to page 5 of the deck; since 2008 the compound annual growth rates of rate base and core earnings are 10% and 12% respectively.
This is a rather remarkable achievement for our industry.
Looking forward next I will provide updates on capital spending and rate base please turn to page 6.
From our prior forecast the 2014 through 2017 capital forecast increased $400 million.
The increase reflects the catch-up of 2013 GRC capital expenditures into 2014 together with updated transmission cost estimates including FAA requirements for the Tehachapi project.
During 2014 a major focus for us is to ensure that we invest the capital dollars authorized by the CPUC for infrastructure replacement and reliability related projects.
For 2013 SCE's actual capital spending was $3.5 billion or $300 million below our forecast.
This was largely due to transmission delays and lower cost on two completed renewable transmission projects in 2013 as well as a slower than planned ramp-up of an infrastructure replacement spending even though we were able to increase reliability infrastructure investments $300 million over 2012.
Historical capital expenditures are shown in the appendix to this deck.
Please note that our current capital forecast does not including spending for storage projects preferred resources to replace San Onofre or transmission projects that are currently included in the Cal ISOs resource plan.
Potential expenditures for projects like these are currently under consideration.
Please turn to page 7; as Ted mentioned our rate base forecast reflects only minor changes with a net $100 million decrease by 2017.
The growth rate remains at 7% to 9% per year through 2017.
Once we get a phase two decision and a SONGS OII which is considering if some portion of SONGS is still used and useful we will then update our forecast accordingly.
On page 8 we have updated the status of our fuel and purchase power of what we refer to as ERRA.
We look to get a CPUC approval this spring of our 2014 forecast proceeding.
You may recall from last year that the CPUC had deferred consideration of a portion of the ERRA costs that relate to SONGS shutdown decision until the overall SONGS regulatory review is completed.
We have provided an updated estimated of the 2013 net SONGS costs of $467 million and have agreed to defer collection until consideration of the OII if we receive a timely decision of our 2014 forecast proceeding.
Overall SCE has under collected -- was under collected by just over $1 billion in this account by year end 2013.
While the ERRA situation was important from a near term liquidity perspective we believe that SONGS OII will be the key driver for recovering SONGS replacement power costs.
I should also mention that while we focused investor attention on the ERRA under collection we have added to our disclosures and noted at the bottom of the slide that for all regulatory balancing accounts SCE had a net over collection of $554 million at year end 2013.
At the same time SCE had availability of $2.46 billion under its $2.75 billion credit facility.
On page 9 I have noted a couple of procedural updates on our 2015 general rate case.
First the two assigned ALJs hosted a pre-hearing conference on February of 11 where the schedule for public participation meetings and details on the timeline for hearings and motions were discussed.
We anticipate the ALJs will publish a schedule shortly.
We continue to press for a timely decision by the end of 2014.
However over the last few years the investor on utilities in California have experienced delays in receiving their final GOC decisions.
Also with the sale of Four Corners we are updating our GRC request to remove SCE share of cost related to this coal-fired plant.
This will lower the requested revenue requirement modestly in each year.
The revenue requirement numbers on page 9 incorporate the sale of Four Corners.
Next I'd like to provide some perspective on key assumptions behind our 2014 earnings guidance please turn to page 10.
You will recall that when we first gave 2013 earnings guidance [indiscernible] that we would expect both 2013 and 2014 earnings would exceed the simplified rate base earnings model that we have discussed for some time.
This was because cost savings and income tax benefits were expected to be realized.
We also indicated that these benefits will be trued-up in the 2015 general rate case and would not apply to earnings in 2015 and beyond.
We still believe this to be the case.
For 2014 the simplified rate base model would yield earnings per share of $3.40 for SCE.
To be clear we are using a 2014 rate base forecast of $22.1 billion from page 6.
This rate base number is the midpoint between the request and range cases.
We have excluded SONGS rate base pending the decision in phase two of the songs OII proceeding.
The authorized return on common equity for both CPUC and FERC is 10.45%.
Our assumptions also include a 48% common equity ratio and a flat share count.
We then see a net upside of $0.45 per share at SCE.
We deduct $0.07 per share to account for the remaining 52% of the capital structure related to SONGS cost of debt and preferred stock.
There are $0.52 of positive items primarily related to O&amp;M additional income tax benefits and energy efficiency.
The 2014 guidance also assumes $0.15 per share in holding company costs.
We'd assume no non-core impacts in our guidance.
We plan to update our non-core guidance based on the outcome of the EME bankruptcy.
The Bankruptcy Court as Ted said is scheduled to consider the EME Plan of Reorganization on March 11.
This gets us to the midpoint of $3.70 per share for both core and basic EPS with a range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share.
We have noted the major assumptions on the right side of the slide.
In conclusion of my remarks I will make a few additional points please turn to page 11.
As Ted said our main goal is about creating shareholder value.
From a financial perspective that means delivering on rate base and earnings growth objectives while generating sufficient cash flow to support both our capital plans and common dividend growth objectives without the need for additional common equity.
That concludes my comments.
I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A now.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions).
Our first question comes from Mr.
Dan Eggers.
Good afternoon guys.
Hi Dan.
I guess question number one just as it relates to the GRC with all the ERRA balance announcement over cost of [ph] revenues that you guys have put out there in projections for higher gas prices and renewables.
What sort of bill inflation are you guys projecting for kind of 2014 2015 2016 for customers based on plan? Good question.
Generally when we talk with investors its our goal to target somewhere between 3% and 5% annual increases in the total bill.
So you have to take -- you got different pieces you got fuel and purchase power base rates transmission and the like.
But 3% to 5% is the internal objective that we try to target.
Now for 2014 I am not sure exactly where that comes in maybe slightly higher but we will be working that as we go through the regulatory process.
Okay got it.
And then I guess just on the OII process with OII-3 kind of each 1 and 2 seeming to kind of try to long are there still expectations that three can have some visibility in the second quarter and so it can just kind of drift later into the summer before there is kind of visibilities to where the commission's haven't? I think the key thing Dan is where do you put the scoping memo to come out and based on Ted's comments we anticipate that somewhere before the end of the first quarter maybe slightly later we should see something from the Commission and that will be really a good indicator of what's the timeframe for all this to be.
Okay.
Thank you guys.
Okay.
Our next question comes from Mr.
Julien Smith.
Your line is now open.
Good afternoon.
Hi Julien.
Hey could you follow-up on the last question just given balancing accounts and all that.
From a cash flow perspective how do you think about this year and the use of short term debt just given prior comments on prior calls? It's a good question.
Right now we have very limited amount that's been used on our lines that was in my script was about $175 million of commercial paper that was outstanding at the end of the year.
And that will ebb and flow as we go through the course of the year and it really sort of dictated -- that was dictated by our capital expenditures and the timeliness of decision making around the ERRA decision and just normal fuel and purchase power fluctuations that occur at an important time.
So its really hard to predict at the end of the year where we will be because you have so many unknowns that have to be decided here.
So I will pause here and let Linda or Ron to see if you want to add anything else to the answer? Okay.
As we go through the course of the year we will watch that and slide.
The key things are the decisions that need to come from the commission which will affect in our liquidity.
Got you.
Are there any chunky items outside of that that affects cash flow that might not be otherwise intuitive? The only other thing I did mention it could be one -- at the holding company if you see the approval of the settlement we could use commercial paper volumes or drawings on our bank lines at the holding company to make the initial payment to the creditors that's $225 million at the close.
Then we have -- you monetize tax benefits during the course of the year.
September is when we typically file our tax return.
So we will just have to look to see what happens in terms of what we actually receive and what we are able to monetize based on the tax positions of the utility and the consolidated entity.
And then at the utility I think I covered this.
There is nothing really that jumps out.
With these financings [indiscernible] thing that occurs at the utility.
We typically build up some short term borrowings and then go out and issue $300 million $400 million $500 million of long term debt and then that will be used to repay commercial paper borrowings.
So that's the normal trend.
Ron? The greenhouse gas revenues and costs those can be chunky as well.
Got you.
And just a quick clarifications on the slides on the transmission spending I know you guys revised that upwards.
Anything pending there again just leftover? Is that all taken care of at this point? There is lot of things going on in that area in terms of what's pending.
We still have some more work to do on Tehachapi in terms of getting cost approvals.
We just recently got one -- Ron why don't you go ahead and fill in the details around what the recent cost increases were approved for one of the projects and for Tehachapi? We submitted an advice letter on our Devers-Colorado project to raise the cost cap that was approved by the commission.
We now appeal.
That project will come within that cost cap and that positions us well for the ultimate cost recovery at FERC.
Tehachapi we will submit our revised costs by probably the end of this year to reflect Chino Hills the FAA and then cost increases that we have experienced over time; that's likely to be an application and a little lengthier process.
But again ultimate cost recovery is at FERC.
The other items that has come in on our transmission projects is the commission did approve our petition to modify and put the voltage control equipment back into the project which they had previously taken out which from a schedule perspective was helpful for us.
Right.
In aggregate what is that in total dollars if you could kind of summarize what the pending is if there is an event there? On voltage control? Or credit in aggregate but specifically.
It's shown in the chart everything is in there.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Okay Julien.
Our next call comes from Mr.
Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Your line is now open.
Hey guys.
Thank you for taking my questions today.
Quickly in the prepared remarks you talked about some of the incremental capital opportunities that actually weren't in the capital spending guidance levels and one of the things you touched on with the Cal-ISO potential incremental transmission.
Can you give a little more color around that both in terms of process for the uncertainty about what that could be if anything and just size and scale? Yeah we wanted to give you a sense further -- some things that are on the I'd say the periphery of our capital expenditures forecast; because those are a little bit further out in time.
And Ron is going to pick up the detail in what we are actually -- there is a particular project an economic project that we are looking at right now.
Yeah from a reliability perspective I believe the plan does include our [indiscernible] but as Jim pointed out that's down the track way later in the decade.
The Delaney-Colorado river line was also included in the plants since that is a economic line that would be subject to competition and determinates in our territory we have every intention of participating.
Meaning that project is in your current CapEx guidance or in the plan submitted by Cal-ISO but not necessarily included in your outlook? Its in the plan just come out by the Cal-ISO it was not incorporated into our capital spending plans yet.
Michael [indiscernible] go back that was the old Devers DPV2 line Arizona portion.
So it has come back as an economic line.
And how big of a -- what are we talking in terms of capital and in terms of years to build? We are still working on it but that's still yet to be determined.
Got it.
Okay thanks guys.
Much appreciated.
Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill.
Your line is now open.
Thank you.
Hi Gregg.
Just was wondering if there was an update on San Onofre settlement talks that there is still a path for that regarding the OIIs? We really don't have anything that we can talk about on that one.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.
Your line is now open.
Good afternoon.
Hi Stephen.
I wanted to talk actually about the longer term point you raised about transformative sector change and you mentioned legislative advocacy AB 327 implementation.
I wondered if you could just talk broadly to -- as you see the [indiscernible] debate and the key change that needs to be made to make sure that as renewables are brought on to the grid they are done so in a thoughtful way.
Well I kind of touched on it in my remarks.
Basically AB 327 reinstated the California Public Utilities Authority to do rate design and give them some general parameters around fixed charge reducing the number of tiers deciding what the grandfather in period would be to our existing distributed generation projects using that metering that energy metering and what the new net energy metering tariff will be few other things in there as well.
But those are the main parts.
So that's now going to be -- decide to give a number of proceedings before the California Public Utilities Commission.
I think our general point of view was the legislator clearly made their intentions around this clear both the Senate and the Assembly passed the legislation with super majorities signed by the governor.
So there is pretty clear indication of what the overall direction should be.
The details are going to unfold over the next few years here.
I think we feel that broadly speaking the value of that legislation in the upcoming activity by the PUS is that it should meaningfully address what we see as subsidies and more importantly cost shifting among sectors within the retail residential rates; and that should be I think a net benefit for fairness for all customers.
The other part that we see that's beneficial is it's a good move towards establishing some level of fixed charge.
We have large fixed costs associated with maintaining the reliability of the grid and this just recognizes some of that.
So those are kind of the broad policy points that we expect to see implemented through AB 327 and the PUC actions related to that.
Understood.
Is there any sense of the time table over which that deliberation process will take place? Well it will probably be over the course of some years.
It won't be all this year but there will be some important moves even as early as here in 2014.
Great.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Our next question comes from Mr.
Ali Agha.
Your line is now open.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Hey Ali.
Hey.
Jim you mentioned in your remarks that your rate base numbers obviously exclude SONGS but once the phase two decision comes out you will relook at those rate base numbers.
Would that also be a time for you to relook at your guidance for 2014 depending on what you do with that SONGS rate base? I think clearly if the commission came out and allowed some portion of SONGS to be considered useful and actually receive the return on common equity as the important piece and for that matter because we have excluded $0.07 you can see in the guidance for 2014 for debt and preferred stock surely we would go ahead and adjust guidance for that purpose.
Okay.
And second question can you remind us at the end of the year what was the equity ratio at Edison that's used for rate making purposes? The weighted average 30 month average was 49.2% Linda? She is saying yes.
49.2%.
Got it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Our next question comes from Ashar Khan.
Your line is now open.
Jim I was just trying to understand if I did my math right.
Just that though we have a negative on the purchase power but overall if we take everything together we have over collected by an amount that's what you mentioned in the slides? I think I said it was approximately $500 million over collected in all our balancing accounts.
So that means if the commission came in and -- if they found some portion of it used or useful on all that the over collection would be much higher right if we get credit from somewhere or the other right? Am I correct or wrong? Its more complicated on that answer.
So let's separate fuel and purchase power out from base rates and decommissioning.
That's why this thing has gotten so confusing.
Its hard to track each piece.
So you may know we are continuing to collect end rates at the whole authorized base rates for SONGS as if we are continuing to operate and we are not recognizing earnings [indiscernible] the depreciation and so we are collecting all those dollars waiting for an ultimate determination as part of the rate making process through the investigation of the OII.
So these are all separate buckets and frankly I think it was yesterday or the day before we sent a letter to the commission to say that you have all these different proceedings going on simultaneously.
Here is our roadmap how we want all these things to come together so you can determine what the rate adjustments need to be; because you are over collected in some areas under collected in others.
You also have decommissioning that's going on separately.
They haven't authorized us to tap into the decommissioning trust.
But in theory since June 6 we have been decommissioning San Onofre.
So the dollars that need to come in and in our disclosures whenever we have a chance to look at them there is at least a couple of hundred million dollars of decommissioning funds for 2013 alone and then we are going to look to 2014 for additional dollars that need to be taken into consideration.
So the net-net-net of all this has to be worked out and its going to take us some time to get there.
Okay.
And if I can just end up with one thing Ted mentioned that we should hear from NEIL after their June board meeting.
So is that the first time we can hear how much money they would give us.
Is that what we should expect to hear some kind of a figure from them and that would assume that we would get something in the second half of the year? Well that's when we are going to hear from NEIL that will be our first opportunity to hear from them after our board meeting.
So all they are really signaling there is that's the timeframe for getting the first reaction from NEIL.
Okay.
But Ted usually once they come with a decision when do they pay out? Is it pretty soon or is there some historic? I forgot it.
I don't think we'd want to signal a speedy resolution here.
It is just the nature of the beast that tends to be slow.
Okay.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Mr.
Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Your line is now open.
Good evening guys.
Hey Jonathan.
Quick one just on the SONGS decommissioning slide 24.
I am not entirely sure if this is new but you have a bullet that's saying estimated decommissioning period may be accelerated? Could you just explain what would be the turbulence as to whether that would happen and what are you referring to? Yeah remember the original plan and I will throw it out to Linda and Ron to give some more details whereas to [ph] decommission the plant after we shut it down in 2022.
That's what plants had incorporated to begin with.
And so we are now looking at various things that we could do to accelerate the timeframe and that really has to do with getting the spend through a lot of the pools as quickly as possible and into dry gas storage.
So I will pause there and Linda or Ron would you like to fill in some more details? I will just add to that that we are going through a very detailed decommissioning cost estimate and part of that process we are looking at optimizing the dollars around decommissioning.
So Jonathan I think you should take from us that once we finish that detailed review we will come out with a new time frame a new dollar amount.
We expect the contributions would be depleted going forward.
$423 million in total annual contributions right now are in rate recovery from the commission and so we will be looking at that.
But there is a lot of moving parts here and the timeframe of the removal of the spent fuel the rate of return there is a whole bunch of issues we are looking and there is probably eight or nine key assumptions here escalation of costs going forward.
So this number is going to change as we go forward here and the last time we talked about it we had over $3 billion interest for San Onofre currently and the cost estimate was slightly over that amount.
So we were nearly fully funded and the final cost studies will give us a better picture of where we are.
Okay.
Then Jim maybe on a higher level but you took these extra potential capital spending items you talked about.
You talked about some of the transmission I think they are no longer storage that was part of that too? Yes.
And when you -- can you talk maybe a little bit on that piece and then as you aggregate all of that together is this something we should think of sort of sustaining you in the 7% to 9% rate base drag over the longer period? Is this something that could be incremental over the sort of latter part of the decade? Just how should we think about how we mold that into everything else you're doing if some of it goes ahead? It’s a good question.
I think we need to back up and look at our capital spending in total.
What has been happening and you can see it through the charts the level of distribution spending is stepping up to meet the replacement rates that we need to be at.
So that's just holes in wires underground cables holes so that's why that's going up.
In transmission it has been coming off as we have been furnishing some of the large renewable lines and we just have a little bit of legacy generation that's ongoing.
So these other things we are looking at and considering we haven't made any decisions.
So there is the potential to may be add a little bit to the total level of capital expenditures but its going to take us a little while to work through these things the preferred resources and the storage are the first ones on the horizon that we need to decide what we want to do.
On some of the storage related items they are in the distribution system which we feel that we are well suited for because that's really down to the basic wires of the business that we want to control generally going forward.
So I can't give you a number but we are certainly thinking hard about it and we are launching that growth rate.
We are trying to balance all the things here too in terms of the ultimate level of growth and we want to grow the dividends so all this plays in together.
Could I just ask one other might be a third question but just one the -- as you see the distributed solar movement gathering pace.
And obviously still relatively small versus the overall base.
But I know you have made some investments outside of California.
Is there a structure or a sort of market design destination where you could see yourselves competing in that business? May be I will break it into two parts.
One whether its distributed solar or let's call it more broadly distributed energy resources that would include solar include efficiency programs include storage all of those things.
We see actually a significant investment that needs to be made in the distribution system here in California to really prepare the system for integrating an increase in distributing energy resources.
Jim alluded a little bit in his comments we are clearly in the best position to do that given our ownership of the distribution system.
So that's part one we see a pretty significant investment opportunity on that side.
Its very much in-sync with public policy here in California and very much in-sync with our own strategy.
The second part is whether we'd be able to participate in distributed energy resources again using a broader definition of that might just -- things like we have rooftop solar but broader distributed energy resources outside of the territory.
At this point we are certainly working on that.
We have what we think are some interesting beginnings in that area.
I have kind of taken pains in the past to say we are doing this kind of one step at a time its not bet the ranch type of deal.
But I think we do see some interesting opportunities there primarily be aimed at commercial and industrial customers and would be not just in our territory but outside.
So you could be inside the territory; because initially you sounded like you are talking outside territory? It could be either one of course our primary interest initially is understanding what the opportunities are on a broader scale outside of just our constraints of the 2000 square mile territory.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Our next question comes from John Cohen.
Your line is now open.
Hey good afternoon.
I was just wondering if you can give us an update as to what the process is for SONGS replacement capacity procurement? Is there a level that's going to come from a nascent generation versus transmission.
What's the timing around all that? Ron's going to handle that.
The commission has been approving through our long term procurement plan proceeding the amount of generation that we are going to go out to bid for both ourselves and San Diego those numbers are all public and available.
I don't remember them quite off the top of my head.
They did fold into the Cal-ISOs transmission plan.
So it is being coordinated in that fashion.
Our procurement teams are getting ready to do that and then we have also taking on as Ted alluded to the preferred resources pilot in South Orange County where we will put together a package of replacement options with preferred resources such as demand response solar storage and the like and pilot our team is aggressively putting together to fold in and that will reduce the amount of generation that we ultimately will have to buy through the market.
Okay great.
Thanks very much.
Our last question comes from Travis Miller.
Your line is now open.
Good afternoon.
Hey Travis.
A follow-up on a couple of these questions on all distributed generation etcetera etcetera.
What do you think is the timing element for that and if you guys do move slowly as you characterized it.
Are we talking about five years before its material 10 years before its material when does this become an earnings material earnings driver all this other stuff? This is Ted.
We are definitely interested in the answer of that question as well.
I think the honest answer is its really hard to tell at this early stage.
So we are -- we think it would be foolish to kind of turn a blind eye to it and not focus on it.
This is one of those things that could potentially change how the industry is structured.
So its something we are involved in.
We intend to remain involved in it.
But the pace with which that could happen whether really proves itself out that's very much an open question.
That's why again we are going to take pains to make the statement.
The core value proposition of the company remains very much centered on the exceptionally strong growth story that we see within Southern California Edison particularly ensuring that the distribution system is resilient and reliable and we see a significant investment required there to do that and we think there are ways to continue to address the cost side of the equation so that we don't have a big impact on rates for customers.
That's the core value proposition.
These other activities they remain things that we are actively involved in and we will continue to be actively involved in but its really hard to predict at this early stage what the pace will be and whether they will be meaningful or when they will be meaningful.
Got it.
Okay.
Thanks so much.
You're welcome.
Okay.
Our last question comes from Mr.
Michael Lapides again.
Your line is open.
Hey.
I was just curious what the resolution of [indiscernible] an opportunity to reduce the costs at the parent.
Kind of that $0.15 level it is kind of in that range for a number of years.
But now you don't have the non-regulated subsidiary? Actually we have been addressing that.
I don't remember the exact numbers but we had something in the neighborhood of 80 people within the Holding Company from senior officers to clerical folks.
So it has always been a very modest sized group.
With the EME difficulties we started addressing that and have brought that down actually basically about in line percentage wise with the reduction in staff that we had occurred at Southern California Edison over the last couple of years.
So it has been something we have addressed.
These just aren't particularly big numbers.
But most of the costs there relate to financing and stuff other than what I will call overhead costs.
It’s a great question but its actually not a particularly meaningful number.
I think Jim actually mentioned we are averaging somewhere including financing and all the rest of the stuff we are averaging somewhere around a penny a month so $0.12 currently.
Got it.
Okay.
Thank you Ted much appreciated.
You're welcome Michael.
With the last question I would now like to turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much for joining and please don't hesitate to call if you any other questions.
Thank you.
This now concludes today's conference.
All lines may disconnect at this time.
Good afternoon and welcome to the Edison International First Quarter 2014 Financial Teleconference.
My name is Brian and I'll be your operator today.
(Operator Instructions).
Today's call is being recorded and I would now like to turn call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you sir.
Thanks Brian and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
When we get to Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
If you have further questions please return to the queue.
With that I'll now turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Today Edison International reported solid first quarter results.
Core earnings were $0.90 per share up 17% over last year.
These results are consistent with our full year earnings guidance which we also reaffirmed today.
Jim Scilacci will cover this in more detail in his remarks.
In the last few months we made good strides in resolving the two major uncertainties for investors Edison Mission Energy and San Onofre.
I'll touch on both starting with the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
On March 27 a settlement agreement was reached on all of the issues in the cost recovery proceeding before the California Public Utilities Commission related to the shutdown of SONGS.
This comprehensive settlement was formerly submitted to the CPUC on April 3.
The original signatories included the two principal's owners of SONGS; Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric and the two largest and most active consumer advocacy organizations in the State on utility matters.
These are the California Public Utilities Commissions Office of Ratepayer Advocates and the utility reform network.
Since that announcement two additional groups have joined the settlement.
The first is; Friends of the Earth a prominent environmental group and the most active advocate for closing SONGS in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Proceedings.
The second; is the Coalition of California Utility Employees.
The only organized labor group intervenient in the SONGS OII.
As a result the settlement is supported by representatives from four key constituencies.
The consumers environmentalist labor and the owners.
All of the parties have agreed to work to obtain timely consideration and approval of the settlement by the CPUC.
On April 14 the settling parties held a series of briefings on the settlement for CPUC representatives.
On April 24 the Administrative Law Judge for the SONGS OII published a schedule to review the settlement.
The ruling plans one evidentiary hearing in mid-may and a public participation hearing in early June.
The CPUC will receive written comments from the other parties to the proceeding on May 5 with reply briefs due on May 27.
While the ruling does not have a proposed decision date.
This timeline could accommodate a proposed and final decision this summer; although we can't predict the timing of any decision.
The ruling notes that only two objections to the settlement have been served.
One from an individual and one from an anti-nuclear group.
The strong support for the settlement and minimal opposition the settling parties continue to encourage prompt approval.
As we discussed during our March 27 investor call when we announced the settlement.
Most refunds related to the settlement will be credited against the current under collections in SEC's fuel and purchased power balancing account known as "ERRA".
A favorable decision on the settlement and timely CPUC decisions on the 2014 and 2015 ERRA forecast proceedings should substantially reduce the under-collections by the end of next year.
The March 25 proposed decision on the 2014 ERRA forecast proceeding is consistent with this outcome and on April 1 FCE received a proposed decision that would grant it's request to accelerate the timeframe for filing its 2015 ERRA forecast proceeding.
This would allow SEC to complete its 2015 ERRA proceeding.
Well before year end and implement it in rates next year.
These are constructive developments and we are hopeful that both will be approved by the CPUC at their May 1 meeting.
While these developments are not material to earnings they are important to FCE liquidity.
Let me move to Edison Mission Energy; EME's bankruptcy has now been completed with the sale of substantially all of EME's assets to NRG Energy.
On April 1 we closed on the settlement agreement transaction with EME's note holders.
EME remains a subsidiary of Edison International free of bankruptcy claims and consolidated for tax purposes.
We made the first of three scheduled payments for $225 million to a newly established trust on April 1.
The remaining payments are due in September 2015 and September 2016.
The exact amounts of these last two payments will be finalized once EME's tax attributes currently estimated to be $1.2 billion are finally determined.
This work will be concluded in the next several months.
As we move beyond these uncertainties we continue to make progress on our 2015 general rate case.
The schedule adopted by the CPUC calls for public participation hearings in late May early June evidentiary hearings in July and August and the hearing record being completed in October.
Well no date has been set for a proposed decision.
We intend to meet all of the FCE deadlines to support a timely decision although we can't predict that there will be one by the end of the year.
The significant progress made in resolving SONGS and EME should allow investors to focus on Edison International's long-term earnings and dividend growth.
We see forecasted capital investment producing a 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate and FCE's rate base through 2017.
Beyond 2017 we see the need for annual capital expenditures in electric infrastructure to support reliability at level similar to those we are proposing in our 2015 GRC.
A central tenet of our strategy is that we should lead in modernizing the distribution system.
Building this next generation grid require significant technical know-how and capital investment.
This is something Edison is particularly well positioned to do.
The foundation of our investment case is the strong growth prospects for SCE.
We also recognized the need to have a strategic eye on the transformative changes occurring in our industry that extend even beyond California.
With this in mind we are selectively pursuing other growth initiatives both with SCE and in competitive businesses.
The last several years of investment has built a rate base that is now generating substantial earnings and cash flows.
We believe this additional cash will support both strong future growth and larger dividend increases.
I have said before and reiterate here that we plan to return in steps overtime to our target of paying out 45% to 55% of FCE's earnings in dividends.
Finally to help achieve our mission of providing safe reliable and affordable electric service to our customers.
We need to increase our focus on rate design and operational excellence.
We improved rate design called for with the passage of Assembly Bill 327 is central to managing rates and customer satisfaction in a period when critical infrastructure improvements have to been undertaken.
In the same vein to be a best-in-class utility.
We must continuously identify new cost efficiencies.
The principal metrics we are using to guide our efforts to achieve affordable electric service for our customers are system average rates operation and maintenance cost per customer and unit energy cost per megawatt hour.
Using these high level metrics we are able to create a range of initiatives to improve efficiency.
The more SCE can provide customers with the benefits of these productivity improvements.
The more we can maintain reliability and keep rates reasonable and also deliver on our growth opportunities.
With that let me now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thanks Ted and good afternoon everyone.
I'll cover the following topics; first quarter earnings an update on the SONGS settlements and our fuel and purchased power inter-collection.
Then I'll rate base in 2014 earnings guidance.
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation.
As Ted just said first quarter core earnings are $0.90 per share.
The higher earnings reflect rate base growth in lower O&amp;M.
there are also additional income tax benefits during the first quarter primarily from higher repair deductions.
The overall impact of SONGS was a net $0.02 per share.
For Q1 2013 earnings for SONGS were lower than normal because of higher than authorized O&amp;M cost and refunds recorded in our SONGS balancing accounts.
At the holding company first quarter cost of $0.03 per share consistent with our full year guidance.
With the year-over-year comparison impacted by tax benefits in last year's first quarter.
There are two non-core items in the first quarter of 2014.
The first is the additional SONGS impairment which is $0.29 per share.
This is slightly lower than our original estimate of $0.31.
I'll explain the reason for the difference in a moment.
The second is $0.07 in cost related to the EME bankruptcy.
Please note that that since EME bankruptcy was concluded on April 1 the income from the settlement will be recorded as non-core in the second quarter.
We also re-affirm our belief that the settlement will yield approximately $200 million of net benefits with a little more than $115 million expected in the second quarter.
Please turn to Page 3 on our March 27 call announcing the settlement.
We increased SONGS charges to $730 million pre-tax and the $465 million after tax.
We have updated the charges that are included in our first quarter results with total pre-tax charge of $806 million and $461 million after taxes.
There are number of items that were updated and are detailed in Page 16 of the Investor presentation appendix.
The largest change is from an item that only affected pre-tax income and not after tax income.
This is a refund of revenue from SONGS prepared deductions and other tax items that are flow through items for income tax purposes.
SCE will ultimately recovery these revenues from customers when these deferred taxes are paid to the IRS.
This is the primary reason why the pre-tax impairment went up while the after tax impairment didn't change that much.
The charge of $0.29 recorded in the first quarter does not impact the estimated ongoing income benefit from a settlement of $0.03 per share in 2014 and which will be recorded after the settlement was adopted by the CPUC.
More information on the regulatory asset accounting is provided in the appendix.
The appendix also includes a settlement overview and a new slide that lays up this sharing mechanics between shareholders and customers of any future recoveries from either MHI or NEIL.
There is nothing significant to record on either MHI or NEIL.
Please turn to Slide 4.
Slide 4 is the year of recovery chart that we showed on our March 27 call.
This chart depicts the SONGS settlement refunds and increase in fuel and purchased power rates and distribution from the SONGS Nuclear Decommissiong Trust that would materially reduce the ERRA inter-collection by the end of this year.
Please turn to Page 5.
Page 5 is the updated ERRA recovery chart because of higher natural gas and market prices impacting both the March 31 actuals and our April to May forecast our projection of the ERRA inter-collection through May 31 has increased by $185 million to just over $1.6 billion.
The expected distribution from the SONGS Nuclear Decommissiong Trust have not changed.
The estimate of the settlement refunds has increased by approximately $95 million to $575 million.
There are number of items that increased to refund but the most significant is the refund of flow through tax benefits I mentioned earlier.
The last item is the impact on our 2014 ERRA filing on the inter-collection.
On Thursday as Ted said at this week we expect the CPUC to approve our amended 2014 ERRA obligation because of the increase in natural gas [forwards] and market prices not included in our filings.
A reduction in the inter-collection is expected to be substantially less to what we've previously showed.
As we all know natural gas in power markets have been quite volatile this winter and prices are now off their peaks.
Therefore the ultimate inter-collection of fuel and purchased power at year end 2014 is highly expected but likely to be higher than what we showed on March 27.
In late May SCE will file its 2015 ERRA obligation and at that time we will provide a revised ERRA forecast for year-end 2014 and 2015.
On Page 6 and 7 we have reaffirmed our capital spending and rate base forecast through 2017.
As Ted said this includes the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rates.
A rate base through 2017.
I would note two things; first our actual capital spending for the first quarter was $684 million below the full-year trend line.
However we expect the full year spend to come in within the range provided.
Second; our forecast largely reflects the scope of work included in the 2013 2014 California ISO Transmission Plan recently approved by its Board of Directors that plan does include additional investment in SCE service territory that will be made in 2018 and beyond.
Additionally the California ISO deferred action on the proposed Delaney-Colorado River Project which would be a competitive project under the new FERC rules and one that we would be interested in pursuing if the project is economic.
On Page 8 we've highlighted key elements of our capital spending and rate based growth from transmission and distribution investments from testing our liability as well as meeting California renewable goals.
On Page 9 we have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance of $3.16 to $3.80 per share and updated our GAAP guidance to reflect actual non-core items recorded in the first quarter.
We continue to exclude future non-core items for guidance.
Our key earnings assumptions are unchanged.
Although we don't provide quarterly earnings guidance.
I do want to remind everyone that when we use this simplified earnings model as a starting point for earnings guidance.
SCE's operating expenses are generally recognized more evenly throughout the year while revenues are more weighted to the third quarter.
I'll close on Slide 10 by reiterating what we believe our shareholder value commission model is an attractive one.
We worked through our major uncertainties as Ted said and in the case of SONGS created alignment between customers and shareholders to aggressively seek recoveries from MHI and NEIL.
We have reaffirmed our growth opportunity through T&amp;D focused investment program complimented by decoupled business model that mitigates the impacts of fluctuating energy sales.
Lastly our total return prospects are supported by our significant dividend growth opportunity.
In short we believe we're executing on our commitments to our shareholders and we will continue to do so.
Okay operator.
Let's move to Q&amp;A.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions) first question from Michael Weinstein UBS.
Your line is open.
Hi good afternoon.
It's Julian here.
First quick question if you can just following up on the transmission side of the equation.
I'd be curious to the extent to which the State is pursuing broader solicitations beyond just the Delaney one.
Could you comment to the extent to which that your CapEx budget is exposed to that the near and long-term and also to the extent to which you're interested in pursuing other projects that are within the State? Okay let me start with that one and I'll have others to fill in.
I don't really think it's going to affect our capital budgets that we've shown publically which goes out through 2017.
Beyond 2017 there could be some implications and I will suggest that we having interest if not through Southern California Edison through the competitive side of the business to participate in transmission projects outside the Southern California Edison service territory so there is potential if we lose at SCE they may be able to pick it up through the competitive side of the business but that's still very premature.
Do you want to follow-up? Yes on a separate topic I don't know if anything left there.
But just again going back to ERRA liquidity just from a high level here just to make sure I'm hearing you correctly.
At the end of the day despite some of the impacts that higher power prices might be having on your liquidity and ERRA balancing accounts.
Ultimately your rate base and CapEx plan is intact and obviously has been shifted but I just want to make sure I'm hearing you with respect to your current spending versus plan two.
For us it's has not changed.
Next question.
Daniel Eggers Credit Suisse.
Your line is open.
Can you just updating investment talk about extending bonus depreciation and some talk recently about a permanent decision on bonus depreciation what affect would that have A; on cash flow and B; on the agreement you have with the EME bankruptcy as with the estate as far as your ability to monetize those tax attributes? You're probably seeing Dan it's Jim.
You're probably seeing the same things we have from the Senate side proposal to extend bonus depreciation at 50% for two years.
As it been here last several years 50% bonus depreciation is a tremendous source of cash for the utility given the large amount of its capital budget running at $4 billion a year.
I can't give you number off the top of my head but its meaningful.
So in effect what happens is that cash would be available to Southern California Edison and since it would cover both 2014 potentially it's retroactive and looking forward prospectively 2015 that's a little hard to say what the impact would be on 2015 because right now it's not contemplated in our general rate case filing with the [tax] here is 2015.
So we may have to update the filing if that were the case.
So it's harder to say what the impact would be on 2015 cash flow because it could be updated through the making process.
Flipping over the other side of the equation Edison International and the impact on the settlement.
It would likely be that Southern California Edison had 50% bonus level would be in an NOL position or would be utilizing all the tax benefits available with the 50% bonus.
Therefore the NOLs that sit at EIX that our EIX loans or EME's would sit there and wait for future timeframe when we could actually monetize those and we're talking Federal Tax benefits here because as you recall the State of California does not recognize bonus depreciation.
So there are tax benefit that can be utilized for State Tax purposes that may not be able to being utilized for Federal Tax purposes.
So I would suggest roughly if there's a 2-year extension of bonus.
It could in effect backup the monetization probably 1.5 years to 2 years.
That means you have the fund the payments to the State via other means until the money is available to be procured from the EIX tax up is that right? Right so we've got our revolvers shooting up EIX that we use to fund requirements and we would look to use our revolvers with some other type of similar facility for a 1 year to 2 year if that's going to be delayed to 2 years.
Next question.
Hugh Wynne Sanford Bernstein.
Your line is open.
So I was wondering if I could I could trouble you though walk us through Chart 21 and comment a little bit about old residential rate design OIR what is the discount that [indiscernible]? Okay so Page 21 it's the residential rate design.
OIR page in the deck for those who are on the phone.
I'll start then hand it over to Ron.
The chart here depicts what currently we have in place is the four-tier structure and the price of each tier goes up as you step up through the tiers.
So the highest tier being approximately $0.32 a kilowatt hour as you're using those incremental kilowatts and we have proposed through the rate design proceeding to reduce the tier's down to two tier's ultimately and also increasing the fixed charge which is currently $0.94 a month to $10 and that's currently working its way through the PUC and I'll stop there and throw it over Ron add detail here.
Right what Jim was describing as what's referred as the phase one of the proceeding which will be ongoing throughout the year.
We expect the decision either late in the year or early next to be implemented in time for summer 2015.
We will step down the tiers overtime.
We expect to get the two tiers by 2017.
We will increase the fix charge over a 3-year period and what that will enable us to do is reduce the differential between our highest tier and our lowest tier to arrange that we're targeting.
So that's really the long-term.
In the short-term for this summer which is referred to as Phase II don't ask me why Phase II comes before Phase I but we've reached settlement with the consumer advocates there.
The Commission had given us direction to stay within the four tier arrangement.
So the way we are getting the upper tier rates down in relation to the lower tier's is we are putting the majority of the rate increase into tiers I and II that's the 12% and the 17% we are showing on the slide that keeps the rate increases in tier's III and IV much smaller they'll be set residually that we are currently estimating about 2% to 5%.
So that will help shrink the upper tier to lower tier differential which is really our long-term our overall goal to take that cross subsidy out between higher used customers and the lower used customers.
Okay and the fee you're phasing for the fixed charge.
I assume you're talking I'm sorry $15 $16 $17 is that right? Yes $15 $16 $17 $5 $7.50 $10.
And the reason for the $10 long-term target.
I'm sure that's maturely below the sort of fixed cost of supply to the customer is there are reason that you chose $10? That's what the legislation dictated was $10.
That's the maximum that you can request? That's correct.
I think we've said publically that the process service is probably closer to nearly $30.
Nearly $30 right.
The fixed portion of the cost of service is that what you mean it? Yes.
Next question.
Gregg Orrill Barclays.
Your line is open.
Just two quick ones.
First on quarterly drivers if you could break out the tax impact of repair taxes versus other and then just back to Slide 20.
The 33% reserve margin and how that impacts you thinking in ERRA or otherwise? Okay so maybe we can reverse the order and talk about the reserve margin.
So this is the current situation state and now how are the effects.
You can tell by the numbers that 33% reserve margin is a quite a bit capacity and energy within the state to meet the needs for this year.
There are some local issues that we have; we have done a lot of work in South Orange County to relieve both of these issues.
And there are some other related in pass up in the San Joaquin Valley where we have been working on a transmission project seems like forever and we are delayed right now and hopefully with the – we can get that resolved but the drought is impacted some regional areas up that.
So this is incorporated in our current forecast and I guess one other thing I should point out Gregg that when you think about the drought there in California.
We've got about 1 000 megawatts of hydro in our system.
Clearly the capacity of hydro system will be down this year but what this chart was trying to show that we are heavily dependent on the Pacific Northwest and they are much closer to normal there as opposed to what happened here in California.
So if we looked to the Northwest that is the critical factor and of course we've got the Pacific intertie set up lines quite a bit of power from a Pacific Northwest to the Southern California well that's the point of this chart here.
I'll pause for a second and let you follow-up on if we cover the question on related to ERRA.
No I think you did that's fine.
Okay so on the earnings related to the pieces for taxes.
Mark do you have anything there? So on the pre-tax impact on for the quarter was $231 million.
The tax component of that is $135 million so the after tax was $96 million and then the 10-Q has some additional details in it on what the amounts are in the effective tax rate [indiscernible].
Okay but the other outside of the pair.
The other items were are they general category that they were related to? The flow through items for the quarter were all property related majority relates to repairs and so our effective tax rate when you set aside the SONGS non-core item was very similar to first quarter of last year which is around 25% 26%.
Okay thank you.
Next question.
Michael Lapides Goldman Sachs.
Your line is open.
Ted I want to just touch base on the comments you made about potential investment both looking for avenues or opportunities for growth within the utility but also outside of the utility? Can you talk about some of those in both categories maybe starting with ones outside of the utility that you're likely to look at going forward and then some if there are non-traditional ones within the utility touch on those as well please? Yes just probably at a high level at this point but we've mentioned before the acquisition that we made a while back of SoCore the rooftop solar generation company and that's really the starting point for a platform focused on providing integrated energy services to commercial and industrial customers and that would be largely aimed outside of the SCE territory.
We also are looking selectively at some projects that would involve electric transportation and potentially some water reclamation water treatment activities.
Where there is a strong nexus between electricity usage and water quality.
Inside the utility the pieces that we've mostly focused on are really things that further public policy initiatives within the State.
So for instance that California ISO along with some other State agencies have clearly identified a set of 'Preferred resources' that would be used for dealing with some of dislocations with San Onofre going out.
So these are things like distributed generation storage energy efficiency demand response.
So we are looking at some pilot projects that would provide referred resources particularly in the areas most affected by San Onofre going out.
And that would be additional growth opportunity within the utility.
The State has a mandate on energy storage 1 300 megawatts across the State.
Our share of that is a little less than 600 megawatts within SCE and half of that can be actually owned and put in rate based by the utility.
So we are looking at those opportunities that would really ducktail with our modernizing the distribution system efforts.
Community solars and other areas where that actually might be a combination of growth opportunities both within the utility and outside of the utility.
So those are some of the high level areas.
I think our approach is pretty well on this Michael.
We prefer not to go out and ballyhoo all kind of nifty ideas before we really had a chance to kind of run them to ground and really have a more factual rendition of what those growth opportunities would be.
So this point we are looking at number of things.
We think there are some good opportunities and as I said in my comments.
It's important to have a strategic eye on where some of these transformational changes might take place to both within California and outside and those can represent some decent growth opportunities.
How do you think about kind of [bogie] or the metric you would use between allocating capital to non-utility investments versus allocating more capital back to your shareholders including potentially revising upward the dividend payout ratio target that we are seeing a couple of other companies in the industry kind of go through the same thing you have big CapEx periods been a little of a slowing and a target payout ratio that keeps getting bumped up multiple times over a several year period.
Well I think very long-term if in fact we have good growth opportunities that's really what will provide sustained earnings growth and sustained earnings growth ultimately circles back to providing sustained dividend growth.
So it's the usual balancing acted every company has to go through.
We see some very good opportunities both within California and potentially outside to operating solid sustained earnings growth rate.
So we will look at each of those and it meets the hurdle requirement and we can see something that's really durable not just kind of one-off stuff or things that really are more distractions than sustained growth opportunities we will look at those and invest accordingly.
The reason I keep coming back to the statement time and time again that we intend to return to our targeted payout ratio 45% to 55% which I think is roughly correct for a company that has the level of growth that we have been experiencing for the last several years.
So first step is to get ourselves back to that targeted payout ratio.
Today we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 35% the payout ratio.
Our target is 45% to 55%.
So in order to get there that suggests you have to have dividend increases that are a higher rate than what your earnings growth rate is and as we've said we intend to do that in steps overtime.
Got it thank you.
Ted.
Much appreciated.
You're welcome.
Thanks for the good questions.
And Michael just one additional thought just from a rate making perspective.
We have a holding company decision that we must give first priority to the utility when allocating capital but there is plenty of capital to go around that's hasn’t been a factor for sometime but we must live under that requirement.
Understood thank you Jim.
Much appreciated.
Next question.
Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Your line is open.
So I wanted to go back to this question about the statement about the 33% reserve margin despite the retirement of SONGS.
So I know that this is on 2014 but does it mean that you think that you can meet the reliable needs of your service territory without actually signing PT's and your gas plans to replace to the [nuke] and purely throw some transformation upgrades and managing efficiency another non-generation methods? Well there's Angie it's Jim.
Ron and you jump over and then Ron can probably give you a full answer on this here but the fact is we've got a lot of energy in this state of times but may not be in the right place and we need to have voltage in the right places too and to in order need combination a lot of things.
So we're going to need to meet the 33% renewable requirements.
We have the storage requirements and we are going to have the Commission has recently decided preferred resources to replace SONGS that includes Natural Gas powered generation and we have one through cooling plants going out at the end of the decade.
A certain portion of that is going to need to be replaced with new generation.
So there is a whole host of things that need to be done here and coordinated to get it right and I'll pause here and look to Ron or [Stu] to add detail.
I think it largely captured Jim this is Ron.
In the short-term we've been focused on transmission upgrades to deal with local constraints in remediate term there is a long-term procurement decision out that identifies local generation resources that are required in the LA basin for both SONGS and eventually the ones through cooling units going away and you know at a very high level there are targets of what we are going to achieve with preferred resources that we've been talking about the energy storage distributed generation energy efficiency but the balance or the bulk of it.
And [Stu] probably has the precise number will be solicitations that we do for natural gas fired powered plants.
Our desires within the basin to reduce the amount of transmission we need to do.
Thank you and separately about the SCE's rate base growth the 7% to 9% key growth.
How does it translate into earnings growth meaning should I anticipate that there is a possibility for earnings to grow faster than the rate base? Thanks to for instance some efficiencies on the PAN side of another reasons.
So Angie it's Jim.
It should imply that if we are earning off for as return that rate base growth should be coming pretty close to earnings growth and what can affect that upper-down is the level of short-term debt.
You might have in the capital within -- you maybe carrying at any particular time because that's in effect at UDC earnings but we typically don't carry a lot of short-term debt unless we are bridge funding over a certain period.
Now clearly tax benefits for our O&amp;M savings have the capacity to enhance your earnings over and above your authorized return.
We are not forecasting anything and what we have right now is being given up as part of the test year of the 2015 GRC and we would look to continue to seek efficiencies wherever we can and drive our cost down.
So we are targeting to want to get our cost metrics more in line with second to first quartile performance and we are not there yet.
So there is the possibility for additional savings we just have to fund it.
So that I'll pause.
If you want to follow-up how about that? No I'm all set.
Thank you.
Next question.
Jonathan Arnold Deutsche Bank.
Your line is open.
Just curious and you've talked about this before you've said in the past on the topic of going to distributed generation in the speaking the residential sector that you'll focus more on upgrading the grid in California to the level what will be needed as you see that thing out and is there some kind of structural impediment to you considering participating in that business some point in the future? Maybe you need to sort of have the rate design issues sort it out especially those you know to address.
I guess planned as to your satisfaction.
Is there any side of business that we could ever see you sort of deciding to competing on your own territory? Jonathan it's Ted.
I'll take a crack in answering that.
I think generally our sense is been the residential rooftop solar business models really largely requires subsidies and kind of cost shifting mechanisms to really be viable that is not been as appealing to us.
As a result we've really focused more on the commercials and industrial distributed generation activities.
I think for the foreseeable future.
We would not really look to try to put residential rooftop solar into owned that put it into our rate base.
Outside of the utility we do participate in couple of funds that really are companies that provide funds for doing both residential rooftop solar but that's a fairly indirect and small involvement in our part.
So really the way we see it is our primary strategy is provide the network provide the backbone through a modern distribution system that really facilitates any and all of these distributed resources.
Whether that's rooftop solar or whether its storage and anything else.
That's the part that we are uniquely positioned to do well and that's really where our investment dollars are focused in the utility.
Next question.
Brian Chin Merrill Lynch.
Your line is open.
I just had a follow-up question on the income tax repair deduction for the quarter.
John can you speak up a little bit? Yes I have a follow-up question on the income tax repair deduction for the quarter.
I don't think you quantify that but it's $0.14 for the entire year was that mostly recognized in 1Q or how should we think about the timing of that recognition? We are scratching our head here.
You mean along the guidance right.
Yes I'm sorry that was included in our guidance.
I think we will have to take a closer look at that we will come back to you on that.
Okay because it looks based on the quarter it looks there was a decent amount of property related tax gains for the quarter and I didn't know how much of that was the associated with that $0.14 that you laid out in guidance because it was $0.16 according to quarter and I'm not sure if most of that was recognized during the quarter.
We are going to have to follow back.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks for the question.
You stumped us.
Next question.
Ashar Khan.
Begin your line is open.
My question has been answered.
Thank you.
Next question.
Kit Konolige – BGC.
Your line is open.
Inc</strong> On Jim to follow-up on your comments that nothing new recovery from MHI or NEIL.
I see on Slide 18 it seems to indicate that NEIL might have communication about recovery in the second quarter but maybe not is that sometime around the second quarter? That's our best estimate from what we've heard thus far.
Inc</strong> Okay and – what's your thinking on when the arbitration with MHI might run its course? It will take some time Kit.
We've said previously that we would expect the process to take up to three years.
So we are just really getting into it now and unfortunately we can't give you a lot of details regarding the status of the arbitration.
So its early on and we've got a lot of steps to go down the past.
So I think you should probably just keeping asking us but there is not a lot we can give you given the confidentiality around it.
Inc</strong> It doesn't sound like I have to ask every week though.
Please don't.
Inc</strong> Right I won't and one other area on energy storage.
Ted you addressed that as sort of overview.
The first procurement is done in December 2014 but it looks like most of that is already in existence.
When would we start seeing significant amounts of energy storage that would indicate whether Edison is going to be the one investing in energy storage? We are going to need to file an application in order to incorporate our plans for energy storage besides the ones that were shown on Page 22 at the investor deck.
So it will be public and very obvious in terms of what our plans are and it's going to be wider.
Now I wouldn't expect it to be until later this year and probably first starting next year.
Ron do you want to follow-up.
The only other opportunity for storage is within the preferred resource pilot storage is an option there where you may see some movement as well.
Next question.
Ali Agha – SunTrust.
Your line is open.
Inc</strong> First question what is – at the end of the quarter what was for regulatory purpose calculation what was the equity ratio at the utility? It's almost right on top of 48% 48.9%.
Inc</strong> Sorry? 48.9%.
Inc</strong> 48.9% okay and second question Ted you know historically the company the board has used December as the time period to make changes to the dividend.
As we look forward then your plans to catch up over the next several years or next few years.
Should we continue to think of December as the time period for that? I mean is there any reason why it could not be during the course of the year.
How should we be thinking about this going forward? Well obviously you're right.
December is typically one we've made dividend decision but that's just choice of ours that's not anything that's hardwired.
So I think I would basically say at any point in time based on what we see as the prospects for cash.
We would have the ability to address the dividend and there is not in there it has to be in December or annually but I think at this point.
I would just say our primary focus right now is trying to make sure that we have complete the bits necessary to finish the EME settlement implementation and obviously I'll be focused on getting the San Onofre settlement approved those are the key parts that we are focused on right at the moment.
Inc</strong> Understood thank you.
Next question.
Neel Mitra Tudor Pickering.
Your line is open.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co</strong> I just wanted to touch on the opportunities surrounding competitive transmission outside every service territory.
Where do you see those opportunities and when you think about investing in those would you partner with an incumbent utility or do you see yourself positioned to win some of those projects by yourself? This is Ted.
It is one of those potential growth areas it's a reality that the FERC Order 1000 there is going to be a change in the way many of the transmission projects both within the State and outside get billed.
I would say really at this point all the above is possible.
What we have observed is that most of the transmission projects that are being bid on competitively involves some level of partnership activity.
There is some good reasons for that and I would suspect that would be certainly one of the strong options open to us but it is an active area of enquiry and we are interested in pursuing additional projects on the competitive transmission side if they make sense and clear the return how it is.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co</strong> Can you comment just geographically where you see some of those opportunities within California? I'd rather not get highly specific but the Cal ISO identified particular projects they're going to be looking at and so those are potential opportunities and some cases it will make the most sense for us to do those as we've always done them with Southern California Edison participating directly.
And in other cases it might make more sense to do those through so-called competitive transmission vehicle.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co</strong> Would you out of State or just within California? I think we would look it’s a core competency that we have and we would look at projects again so long as we are confident they can be done for the right kind of risk reward trade-offs and that would clear out return hurdles.
Travis Miller.
Your line is now open.
Wanted to go back to the CapEx forecast.
I heard correctly the 2018 and beyond you're looking at that same kind of run rate at that $4 billion is that correct? Again Travis this is Jim.
We haven't put any forecast out in the domain that we could give you a firm number but directionally the distribution spending we don't expect will decline and we are trying to get our replacement rates for various components.
We need to get them up higher than where we are today and that would imply that distribution spending could go up somewhat.
Expect with it to try to put a number out there.
What the transmission side of the equation would be because those are typically large and bulky investments.
There is to be certain layer of maintenance CapEx for transmission investments that will be steady state and it will go up and down if you have some new expenditures you need to do it for lines or facilities sub-stations.
On the generation side we just have some minimal legacy investments and the only only thing we can't predict here today and I think Ted has already focused on those is walking in the way of either of storage or preferred resources or related investments might due to the overall numbers.
I don't think sitting here today we can tell you what that's going to be because we are just looking at it now and it's something that we will have to evaluate and we won't put out a forecast beyond 2017 and so that's probably well over year from now or if not longer so it's going to be awhile before we actually get into the public domain and what our thinking's are for that? Okay and then at these levels if you have the GRC accepted as you proposed similar level.
How do you think about needs for new equity and timing on that? Again this is Jim.
We have no plans for equity and what's helpful is the EME settlement provides earnings up to $200 million of additional income and things like bonus depreciation is a tremendous source of cash for the utility should Congress decided to want to extend it and the President actually execute something here.
Well there's just a tremendous amount of cash involved bonus depreciation when you have a $4 billion of – around that level of capital expenditures.
So we don't foresee any need for equity given our current plans.
That was the last question.
I would now like to turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone for participating and don't hesitate to call up if you have any follow-up question.
Thanks for hearing.
Thank you that does conclude the call for today.
You may disconnect your phone lines at this time.
Good afternoon and welcome to the Edison International Second Quarter 2014 Financial Teleconference.
My name is Brian and I'll be the operator today.
(Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
You may begin.
Thanks Brian and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our Web site at www.edisoninvestor.com.
After the call we will be posting Ted’s and Jim’s prepared remarks.
Tomorrow we will file and distribute and regular business update presentation which has additional information on current topics.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
When we get to Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
If you have further questions please return to the queue.
With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Before we begin the call I would like to welcome Maria Rigatti who joined us this week as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Southern California Edison.
Many of you know Maria from her prior role as Chief Financial Officer of Edison Mission Energy.
We are pleased to have Maria’s depth of experience and leadership.
I’d also like to welcome Connie Erickson to her first earnings call.
Connie is Southern California Edison’s new Controller and joined us in May from a utility in the Southeast.
Okay.
Let’s go ahead and get down to the business at hand.
Edison International today reported second quarter core earnings per share of a $1.08.
This is a 37% increase over core earnings per share in last year’s second quarter.
This strong performance reflects continued earnings growth from investing in modernizing and expanding our core wires infrastructure managing our costs and benefiting from favorable tax items.
Based on our year-to-date results we expect full-year earnings for EIX to be well above the high-end of our core earnings guidance range that is above $3.80 core earnings per share.
There are several components driving this expectation which Jim will discuss in his remarks.
Obviously this effectively moots our current earnings guidance.
We are not providing new earnings guidance at this time.
We want to at least get through the summer since our earnings are weighted most heavily to the third quarter and may provide new guidance when we release third quarter earnings.
Of course we are also focused on completing the remaining steps for getting the SONGS OII settlement approved.
The record of the proceeding is now complete.
We are currently awaiting a proposed decision from the administrative law judge.
As we previously reported the Settlement has a diverse group of signatories representing all the major groups of intervenors in the SONGS OII proceeding.
That is utilities consumer groups labor and environmentalists.
Beyond the direct signatories several other groups expressed support for the settlement in testimony with relatively little opposition.
The next step is to receive a proposed decision from the ALJ which we hope to see shortly.
We are also moving ahead on the decommissioning planning process.
SCE anticipates filing an initial decommissioning plan with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission later this year outlining the scope schedule and budget for decommissioning.
Based on a recently completed site-specific study we now forecast SCE’s share of SONGS decommissioning costs to be $3.3 billion in 2014 dollars.
When we take that number and escalate costs over the decommissioning period and then present value it SCE’s share of costs is $2.9 billion.
On the other side of the equation the current market value of SCE’s decommissioning trust funds for SONGS Units 2 and 3 total $3.1 billion after estimated taxes as of June 30 2014.
The bottom line is that we have $2.9 billion in present value costs versus $3.1 billion in present value of the trust funds which leads us to conclude that San Onofre decommissioning is now fully funded and future contributions are not needed.
We are awaiting approval from the PUC to use decommissioning trust monies to pay for the early decommissioning planning work we have been doing as well as ongoing operating costs since the plant was shut down in June of last year.
On a related item on May 1 the CPUC approved SCE’s 2014 forecast for fuel and purchased power or what we call the ERRA account.
SCE incorporated this decision in customer rates in June.
SCE also filed its 2015 ERRA forecast application in June.
These are important steps in reducing the under-collection in the ERRA account.
Turning to the general rate case we made our supplemental filing on safety and reliability risks as required by the Assigned Commissioner Ruling.
The Administrative Law Judge issued a revised GRC schedule for testimony hearings and briefs.
Hearings begin in late September representing approximately a two month delay.
The schedule does not have a target date for a proposed decision but it clearly will not be issued until sometime into 2015.
The Commission has already approved making the final GRC decision whenever that may occur retroactive in rates to January 1st of next year.
While we have to accept the realities of this delay we continue to support the separate efforts Commissioner Picker is leading to streamline decision processes at the Commission which is needed.
The last regulatory topic I want to touch on is rate design.
We and the other investor owned utilities continue to work with the CPUC on their efforts to implement the constructive changes in residential rate design authorized under Assembly Bill 327 signed into law last October.
We are well into the procedural schedule for the phase dealing with fixed charges and compressing rate tiers to bring the rate structure closer to true costs.
A decision on this is scheduled in the spring of next year.
On July 10 the CPUC established a separate docket and approved the procedural schedule for the last phase.
This includes creating a new net energy metering tariff to better reflect the cost effects of net metered customer-installed solar on the system.
This is to be finalized by the fall of next year.
I’ll close with a few comments on our longer-term growth potential and dividend policy.
As I’ve met with investors over the past few months I’ve made clear that we see sustained growth opportunities at SCE even beyond the current 2015 - 2017 forecast period.
On our last earnings call I talked about the need for annual capital expenditures in electric infrastructure at similar levels to those proposed in the current rate case.
We continue to believe that for the foreseeable future the electric grid is critical to facilitating public policy goals including those to reduce greenhouse gases.
That said the distribution grid needs additional capital expenditure to support two-way flows of electricity created by distributed generation as well as new technologies such as electric vehicles and energy storage.
This is by far the largest additional future investment in the grid not currently contemplated by the general rate case process.
We will submit our Distribution Resource Plan outlining these investments in 2015 as required by Assembly Bill 327.
We have three large transmission projects that are part of the approved California ISO Transmission Plant that are expected to go into service between 2018 and 2020.
We are also interested in the Delaney-Colorado River transmission project which was recently approved by the California ISO as an economic and therefore a competitive project.
We feel our competitive position is enhanced from SCE owning an existing corridor.
Together with electric vehicle infrastructure and energy storage all these potential projects will complement SCE’s continued focus on growth in electric infrastructure investment.
We are not prepared at this time to attach specific numbers to these categories but w e believe it is important for investors to understand why we are bullish about our long-term growth opportunities for some time to come.
And importantly none of this growth relies on additional investment in new generation.
Regarding our dividend policy we fully recognize that our dividend is well below the industry.
I have reiterated several times in these calls that we intend to address this situation by taking more meaningful steps in returning our dividend to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE’s earnings in steps over time.
I consider delivering on this as job #1 for our investors; just as delivering on providing safe reliable and affordable electric service is job number 1 for our customers.
With that I’ll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thanks Ted and good afternoon everyone.
I’d like to add my congratulations to Maria and Connie on their new roles too.
I’d also like to thank Stu Hemphill for being the acting CFO bridging the time period between Linda Sullivan’s departure and Maria’s arrival.
Thanks a lot Stu.
My comments over the -- will cover the following topics: second quarter earnings capital spending and rate base forecast the regulatory calendar and earnings guidance.
Please turn to Page 3 of the presentation.
As Ted already mentioned EIX’s core earnings for the second quarter of 2014 are $1.08 per share or $0.29 ahead of last year.
Higher revenues include $0.17 per share in authorized CPUC and FERC revenue increases that support rate base growth as well as higher costs.
$0.03 of this increase is from a revision to estimated revenue under the FERC formula rate mechanism and the 2008 FERC construction work in process proceeding.
These $0.03 were not included in our original guidance.
The net SONGS impact is a positive $0.03 per share compared to last year mainly related to severance costs that impacted earnings in the second quarter of last year and a small property tax refund this quarter.
O&amp;M costs increased $0.02 per share and include $0.01 of non-SONGS severance compared to $0.02 in the second quarter of last year.
Most of this O&amp;M variance is timing-related.
Higher depreciation and financing costs reflect the growth in rate base and the capital structure supporting that rate base.
Income tax benefits are a significant contributor to earnings during the quarter.
We recorded a $0.09 per share tax benefit from changes in estimates of the uncertain tax positions.
This primarily relates to progress made by the Company and the IRS Appeals in settling the 2003 through 2006 audit cycle.
This also had a spill-over effect into subsequent tax years.
This $0.09 benefit was not included in our 2014 earnings guidance.
In our original guidance we assumed that full-year tax benefits would amount to $0.14 per share.
Through June 30 there are $0.08 of additional tax benefits that were not included in our original guidance mainly related to repair -- higher repairs and cost removal deductions.
Also included in other income are $0.03 for California energy crisis litigation settlements with generators that were finalized this quarter.
You may recall that we have a CPUC-approved incentive sharing mechanism for resolution of these claims.
Taken together this accounts for the $0.27 increase in SCE core earnings as shown in the slide.
For the Edison International holding company costs are $0.02 per share lower than last year largely due to consolidated state tax -- income tax benefits this year.
Included in discontinued operations and non-core earnings is a $0.56 per share benefit related to the EME settlement.
The settlement and the sale of EME assets closed on April 1st as we previously disclosed and was accounted for as a second quarter transaction.
The amount recorded in discontinued operations in the second quarter was $184 million slightly higher than our prior estimate of $152 million.
We expect to finalize the EME tax attributes and the amount of the EME payments by the end this year.
In addition to our earnings discussion let me summarize a couple of items that impacted EIX liquidity in the quarter.
First Edison International made the first payment of $225 million to the EME creditors in April drawing from its credit line as we planned.
Second Edison International made deposits with the IRS of $189 million related to Federal income tax disputes related to EME.
You may recall that EIX agreed to accept this liability as part of the EME bankruptcy settlement.
These items together with timing differences between the dividends received from SCE and paid to the common stock shareholders increased EIX’s short-term borrowings to $666 million on June 30th.
Also during the quarter both SCE and EIX extended their credit facilities for an additional year to July 2019.
There were no changes to terms and conditions.
Page 4 of the presentation has the year-to-date financial story which I won’t review but the earnings analysis is consistent with the second quarter story.
Turning to Page 5 SCE’s capital spending forecast through 2017 continues to be the same.
For the first six months of the year total SCE capital expenditures are $1.6 billion compared to our full-year forecast of $3.6 to $4.1 billion.
On Page 6 of the presentation we continue to forecast compound annual growth rates of 7 to 9% for rate base through 2017.
Page 7 highlights the points on longer-term growth drivers that Ted mentioned in his comments.
Turning to Page 8 based on investor feedback we’ve reintroduced a key regulatory calendar that we will update quarterly with the most important proceedings impacting the utility.
More detailed slides on each of the topics and appropriate updates are included in the appendix.
The final topic is guidance.
Please turn to Page 9.
Ted has already updated you on our plans for guidance.
We have added into the chart a total of $0.23 per share of core items not included in original guidance.
To recap they’re the $0.09 of income tax benefits from uncertain tax positions $0.08 from additional tax benefits repairs and cost of removal $0.03 from additional FERC revenue and $0.03 from generator refunds.
I’ll finish with Slide 10 which we continue to use to frame the investment story for Edison International.
We are looking to close the final chapters on the SONGS regulatory review and the last steps in implementing the EME bankruptcy in the coming months.
As we’ve noted at the lower left of the slide being able to monetize EME tax benefits is dependent on Federal income tax policy.
We’re aware of the potential for extension of bonus depreciation.
On balance we’d see such an extension as net positive for Edison International with important cash flow benefits from lower cash taxes at SCE although it would admittedly delay monetization of EME tax benefits.
Our strategy remains focused on reducing uncertainties delivering on the current and longer-term earnings and dividend growth opportunities as we see and positioning the company for transformative change that we’re seeing unfold around us.
Thank you.
And now I’ll turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&amp;A.
(Operator Instructions) First question comes from Dan Eggers Credit Suisse.
Your line is open.
Good morning guys.
Hi Dan.
Jim on slide 9 can you just re-run through those numbers of all the additional benefits that weren’t in the original guidance just to make sure they went pretty fast -- to make sure I have the right accounting for them? Okay.
Four items.
$0.09 for uncertain tax positions release of reserves; $0.08 of additional repair and cost of removal deductions; $0.03 for generator refunds and $0.03 for FERC revenue -- additional FERC revenue.
Okay.
And then … Which you get to 23.
And then the extra -- are those the core pieces that are going to get you well above the high-end of your range or are there other things you’re seeing in addition to those that would be additive to those expectations? Its -- those are the core things.
Okay.
And then when we think about with the GRC coming through the upside or the benefit from the taxes and the cost savings that are adding this year we should calibrate those back because those are unique to this period and not to the next GRC period is that still correct? Yes.
Okay.
What tax rate should we be assuming beyond this year? Well that’s a good question.
Tell me what’s going to happen when with tax policy.
That’s the real hard one to pin down.
So we still are carrying some NOLs.
So even if they didn’t extend bonus depreciation there could be an impact in future years.
But we haven’t put a forecast out.
We don’t forecast tax policy or tax rates.
So its going to be somewhere between the maximum rate and slightly lower if they don’t extend bonus and I can tell you where it will go to if they do extend bonus.
Okay.
And I guess one last question.
Sorry I didn’t mean to rapid fire all those but just one last question.
Yes go ahead.
Pinnacle raised today the idea of or talked about on their call today utility-owned rooftop solar as a way of trying to allocate or get that resource into the hands of people who probably couldn’t otherwise afford it or couldn’t qualify for it.
Is that an opportunity you would see working in California to try and bridge the gap as to where some of the disproportionate subsidies or benefits are going within the California rate design system? There are a number of things we’re considering.
I think Ted’s comments touched on some of the things that we’re important -- we’re thinking about from an investment perspective.
And our principal focus is looking at the grid and how we can better make investments around the grid to allow greater penetrations of distributed generation.
And we think there are meaningful investments that could be made to support more distributed generations.
I will pause there and look at Ted or Ron did you want to add on to that? Yes maybe just a little bit on it Dan.
I think really our focus has been primarily on the wire side as opposed to the generation side.
And we’ve in SCE something like 90 megawatts of roof top solar already something like 35 different commercial roofs.
But we’ve not really been adding to that portfolio.
Frankly it’s a good competitive environment.
There are plenty of opportunities for lots of third parties to engage in this.
Most of the times they can do it more efficiently than we can in the utility and where we’ve I think a unique contribution to make is in facilitating all of these technology whether its roof top solar whether its potential electrification of transportation in energy storage etcetera.
Really all of that fundamentally relies on distribution system in particular to really work effectively and efficiently.
We are uniquely positioned to provide that investment that’s where we’re focused.
So I don’t think you will see us rush to get into the generation side of this in --- within the utility so much as you really see the utility focus its investment on the wire side.
Very good.
Thank you.
Yes just one last thing to of course we’ve a small investment in the company by the name of SoCore that focuses on commercial industrial customers.
We’ve avoided the residential side because with the commercial industrial area we think its more economic and there is a lot of potential there.
Operator? Next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith UBS.
Your line is open.
Yes.
Sorry to nitpick a little bit further could you elaborate a little bit with regards to whether the FERC side of the equation there could persist when you call it out in that $0.23 or specifically the FERC revenue of $0.03? When you say persist … Is it strictly a one-time item here or should we think about this as continuing on for a certain period of time? Yes it’s more one-time Julien.
What we’re doing is updating our formula rate for actuals and for the 2008 proceeding around our construction work in process proceeding that case was ongoing for a long time and it was resolved.
So it’s mostly one-time.
Got you.
And then when it comes to the energy settlements I mean obviously these things come in -- are somewhat lumpy.
Are there others that are pending to be settled at one go here is there anything else on that front we should be expecting? There is not much left on the energy settlement.
So we’ve been litigating those for over 10 years.
So we are getting to the end of those.
Got you.
So ultimately if you could summarize and I don’t want to put words in your mouth so I will let you talk how would you think about the guidance in the context of year-to-date earnings just to be clear? If you can provide any comment I mean is it as simple as saying well $0.23 on top of your guidance year-to-date? I mean is that begin to approximate how would you think about it? Well I think I will go back to the statement we used and I don’t want to go beyond that or try to expand.
So we’d see earnings being well above the high-end of the range.
And the $0.23 we try to list for you that occurred in the first half alone.
And we’ve projected other tax benefits and O&amp;M savings to occur during the course of the year the balance of the year.
So that’s by putting all these factors together we see it well above.
Excellent.
Moving on to more substantive issues when it comes to the ROE I would be curious how are you thinking about positioning yourself within the context of your future ROE case at FERC given the New England case and the resolution we recently got or at least the clarity we’ve gotten? Well we got some clarity.
Again we have a settlement in place until mid 2015.
Under the settlement we entered into over a year-ago and at that point of time later next year we will take a look at it run all the models and see what they yield and take into consideration what the FERC has provided us in terms of its recent guidance.
And we will have to see if that implies an upward bias.
It’s going to come down to interest rates and where dividend growth rates are in terms of using the FERC model and cranking it through.
So there potentially could be some upside there but you have to moderate it because its really only 20% of our total rate base it’s the CPUC side that really drives things overall.
Right absolutely.
Thank you.
All right.
Next question Gregg Orrill Barclays.
Your line is open.
Thanks.
Two quick ones.
First a point of clarification on whether this year you have pulled forward any benefits of repair tax accounting or maybe if you can provide an update on what you are looking for in 2015 there? And then at this point on the SONGS OII are you still working to bring any more parties on board or do you see any gaps in groups on the settlement? So why don’t we handle that reverse order Ted? Yes just one the second one all the intervenors who are going to provide testimony have done so and that was really what I was kind of capturing there.
In terms of the direct signatories it’s the two utilities the labor group queue ORA TURN and Friends of the Earth.
So those were the direct signatories representing in all four of the main intervenor groups.
In the testimony several other groups mostly consumer various forms of consumer related groups also provided a positive supportive testimony of the settlement.
And as I indicated in my comments really relatively few came forward with any opposition to the settlement.
So I think basically everyone who has standing that wants to speak has spoken and at this point really all that part is over with.
We are really at the stage of waiting for the ALJ Proposed Decision.
Okay great.
Let me cover the first part of it.
I think it is the tax benefits you were referring to and what potential tax benefits there could be going forward into ’15.
And as we’ve said all along we will update with our GRC filing.
All the numbers and we’d expect the benefits that we’re receiving currently the $0.14 referred to before would go away and that’s incorporated in our rates starting in ’15.
But we’re trying to point out here in ’14 the $0.09 of share that’s a release of reserves related to our 2003 to 2006 audit cycle.
We took the -- essentially the hit in the past and now because of the way the negotiations are coming out; we can release those reserves and have benefits earnings.
And I also said the second item when we said there would be 14 in total for the year when we started the year.
What I’ve said in my comments there was an additional $0.08 over and above the 14 of additional repair and costs of removal deductions.
So I think that’s the full line of tax benefits that we see as of the $0.14 for the full-year and through the first six months in the year.
Thanks.
Okay.
Next question Kit Konolige BGC.
Your line is open.
Inc.</strong> Good afternoon guys.
Hi Kit.
Inc.</strong> Ted maybe just to focus a little bit on grid readiness which I think you have described as the biggest single item.
I know you don’t want to put a number on that but maybe you can give us a little more color on what you see as likely to be involved here.
You’ve certainly talked about the two way flows that would be demanded by distributed generation in particular in the past.
But now that you’re going to have to be presenting a specific plan maybe you can give us some detail about what would be involved here from the utilities viewpoint? Yes I will make maybe a couple of overarching points in that and then I will give it to Ron who is really much more directly involved in this part.
We are -- I will do it in terms of buckets.
I think there are a number of things on as you termed it grid readiness side.
I think of it as modernizing and expanding the grid system focusing primarily on the distribution system to make it more flexible and resilient and responsive.
So some of that gets into the stuff that you mentioned the two way flows of electricity today is pretty much designed to handle one way flows.
And the more of the new technologies get introduced whether that’s distributed generation or storage or some of the things around electric transportation the more that distribution system needs to be flexible and responsive.
One of the phrases we’ve used its essentially creating a network system a plug and play system if you will that can handle a lot of those new technologies and still remain reliable.
The second really big bucket I think is on the transmission side and there are a number of things that we’re looking at both within the utility as well as potentially outside the utility in competitive transition -- transmission work.
We see a lot of opportunities particularly in the West on those activities.
So those are probably two of the larger ones.
Beyond that its some of the unregulated business and that’s where as we’ve referred to its energy services focused on the commercial and industrial customers which we see as the most price sensitive as well as having a large enough footprint -- energy footprint that a lot of these things will be economic even without subsidies.
Whereas on the residential side I think continued subsidies will be required to really make those alternatives competitive with the grid.
So those are the big buckets.
Ron can cover more on the grid readiness part.
The particulars on grid readiness really comes down to the control systems and the protection systems on the distribution grid.
We are going to have to put in much more sophisticated more dynamic voltage controls for years.
We got away with capacitors that just switch twice per day once on peak and off peak.
We are going to have to put in more sophisticated voltage controls to deal with a lot more voltage fluctuation.
As we get into two way flows we’re going to have to go with much more sophisticated relaying and protection systems that can detect both the distance and the direction of the fault similar to what we’ve on the transmission grid and then once all that’s in place as Ted mentioned we can loop many more distribution circuits together and operate it more like a network which would actually improve reliability.
And so it’s primarily a controls game.
What I’ve just described for you is essentially our plans around our urban circuits which are already suited for this from the physical infrastructure itself.
When you get out to our rural circuits though however we probably are going to have to upgrade some conductor sizes as well.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
And just so I understood it correctly did I hear you say before that this bucket this grid readiness area is the biggest single prospect for growth beyond ’17 or am I misunderstanding that? No that’s correct.
Inc.</strong> Thank you.
Next question Michael Lapides Goldman Sachs.
Your line is open.
Hey guys just kind of thinking about the bridge for the next couple of years am I right to think a little bit that if you just kind of do rate base math on 2015 because you’re having such a great 2014 in a little bit of an unusual 2014 that 2015 is kind of a down year before growth reaccelerates in ’16? Yes Michael this is Jim.
I think you’re right.
We are guiding people to go back to the simplified model starting in ’15 because the way the regulatory mechanisms work here we pass back to the ratepayer the O&amp;M savings that we talked about $0.35 that are embedded in our guidance and the tax benefits.
Those all go back and they were back to the normal I mean if you take the rate base and times the return on common equity times the 48% common equity ratio and you’re to get earnings pretty fast.
There could be some volatility around that to a certain degree because we will continue to focus on operational and service excellence and there is the potential for additional savings.
But we're not going to forecast anything here but we will continue to look for things to optimize around our costs.
Got it.
And I want to just kind of focus on the balance sheet a little bit.
You talked a little bit about having ramped up short-term debt at the parent.
Can you give us some of the puts and takes? Meaning when do you -- when and how much cash flow do you expect to get this year and next year related to the ERRA? What are your plans in terms of short-term debt at the parent? Just kind of high-level movers outside of CapEx and some of the tax issues you’ve already talked about and obviously net income and D&amp;A.
That’s a broad question.
So let me just pick at it then we will let others chime in.
At the utility in terms of ERRA we said they were at $1.6 billion and we had the big rate increase that went in just … June 1st.
… June 1st.
And we’ve generator refunds.
There is $200 million that will be applied against the $1.6 billion and as rates have now gone up we will start to amortize that down.
An important element in terms of where we get at the end of the year is the SONGS settlement.
There is a large refund that will come out of there and there is an advice filing pending before the Nuclear Decommissioning and if they allow us to go into the decommissioning trust that balance then will be refunded into your account.
So where it ends up I would say right now if they do improve the SONGS settlement and the advice filing we will be materially reduced from where we’re today.
There still could be a balance and that will pick up in ’14 will be materially reduced.
And that balance if any will be picked up in the ’15 year proceeding and amortized down if there is anything remaining.
So any other short-term borrowings? There is actually fairly small amounts of borrowings at the utility right now.
We will see that as a surge if we have capital requirements or other things.
But historically we’ve kept the balances well and it will just depend on capital expenditures going forward.
Moving upstairs to the holding company we said we’re up to $660 million of short-term borrowings and we did that because we made the first payment and we did the tax deposit.
Now we’ve additional payments in ’15 and ’16 for the EME settlement.
And really it’s going to come down to what’s going to happen with tax policy which is going to affect the utility too obviously because that will be a source of cash and there will be less monetization of tax benefits at the holding company if we do see that.
And it would just defer monetization for a period of time.
Once you would expect we will get the on bonus depreciation and the whole EME settlement is designed that it pays off the cost we’ve incurred and payments to the bond holders and for the tax payments we took on our side and some of the employee benefits.
It ultimately is a net positive at Edison International.
How this unfolds its hard to tell at this point in time.
We will just have to see what tax policy is especially at the end of the year.
Got it.
Thank you Jim.
Just one final question.
When you think about -- yes Ted you talked a little bit about the dividend policy and that you may have CapEx levels over time meaning after this GRC that remain in the elevated range that you had now and that you expect for the next year or so.
But what also should happen is net income should have -- should grow obviously and D&amp;A should grow as assets go into service.
So you wind up with a larger base of cash flow to start from and CapEx while remaining elevated is smaller each year as a percent of the total Company.
Does that not give you a little more confidence in the ability to kind of move towards a higher payout ratio? Yes definitely.
And I mean that’s -- I’m kind of running out of new ways to say it.
But I introduced one new one this time that job number one is delivering on getting our payout ratio back into the targeted 45% to 55% of SCE’s earnings.
And that’s probably about as close as I can get to saying everything you just outlined is exactly right that we see increased capacity to move the dividend along at a higher growth rate than certainly what we’ve been doing in the past.
And we’ve to do that.
It has to grow faster than earnings in order to get back into that 45% to 55% payout ratio.
People have been -- investors have been patient.
We’re aware of that.
We’re appreciative of that and we think we’re getting to that spot now where its time to deliver on getting our payout ratio back to where it belongs.
Got it.
Thanks Ted.
Much appreciated.
You’re welcome.
Next question Paul Patterson Glenrock Associates.
Your line is open.
Good afternoon.
Hi Paul.
A lot of my questions have been answered.
Just sort of on the competitive transmission opportunity that you were talking about and the benefit of having the transmission corridor could you give us a flavor or sort of how substantial that advantage is I mean in terms of cost or timing of whatever the sort I mean whatever you can tell? So what you’re referring to just for the clarification is that Delaney-Colorado River transmission line.
Remember going back and you’ve followed us long enough there is already a transmission line that goes through that corridor.
That’s Devers-Palo Verde transmission line number one.
And we tried to do Devers-Palo Verde transmission line number two and Ron Litzinger can tell you all about how fun that was and if we built up to the Colorado River and we stopped there.
Now it’s the adjoining piece that goes out through Arizona.
So I will pause there and let Ron give some more of the details.
Yes.
So we continue to have the entirety of the right of way and we see that as a competitive advantage and now that’s it a competitive gain we’ve got to seek to maximize that and whatever others we can find.
Do you -- I mean I just was wondering if there was -- if you had -- in terms of the competitive outlook how -- is there a value that you can ascribe to that in terms of how much money that saves you vis-à-vis other competitive alternatives? Just what we know historically getting this route and what the alternatives are but we’re putting a dollar figure on that.
Yes Paul just logically just trying to figure it out on top of our heads if you have a right of way that it already exists how difficult it is to secure a right of way and going through all the combination process and getting all the approvals that you need.
It is not easy to do that.
We’ve got a large transmission construction going on and its one of the most challenging things for us to do.
So that’s why I think its important.
Okay.
I just was wondering if there was a -- I mean if there was -- if you could quantify it but I understand if you don’t want to do that.
And then just in terms of financing and what have you I mean one wonders whether or not infrastructure funds or something might be involved in some of the activity.
Do you guys think that there would be with these competitive -- these transmission lines for competitive bid whether there would be a change in sort of the capital structure or leverage that might be employed to develop these things or do you see it pretty much the same as other transmission investments that you've made? No I don’t -- I can’t foresee it at this point in time.
It would be similar to what the -- if you see capital structure would be.
Okay.
Thanks so much.
Next question Ali Agha SunTrust.
Your line is open.
Ted as you alluded to given the schedule that the GRC is moving under it’s likely to spill into next year.
Now normally you make your dividend decisions in December.
Is it fair to assume that you would want the GRC behind you before getting aggressive on the dividend I guess point A.
And related to that is there anything to move you from that December timeline is that just consistency or how are you thinking about these issues? I think you’ve outlined certainly the -- some of the considerations that will go into figuring out where we go from here.
But I'm really not prepared at this point to speculate a lot on timing or amount.
I've done everything I can to make clear that this is a top priority for us and we just have to assess the situation as it presents itself and make the best decision that we can and then explain our decision to investors.
Okay.
We will keep an eye on that.
Jim can you let us know from the way the regulatory accounting math works what is the equity ratio at SCE right now? And I know you guys have been very clear that through the ’17 period you don’t need equity but listening to your CapEx plans beyond that when at the earliest do you think equity does come into the equation if at all for the Company? Question one 48.5 at June 30th.
Okay.
Question two; we have no plans for equity.
Not just still ’17 it could be well beyond that as well? Just no plans.
Okay.
Thank you.
Next question Ashar Khan Visium.

My question has been answered.
Thank you so much.
Okay.
Neel Mitra Tudor Pickering.
Your line is open.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</strong> Good afternoon.
I had a question on slide 7 with the infrastructure liability investment past 2017.
How -- what’s the pace of the drop off? Obviously that’s the big rate base growth for you guys through 2017.
Can you kind of give us maybe the trajectory for it past 2017 and what the drivers are really for rate base growth? Well I will start.
Again we don’t have any projections out there and I think Ted made some comments that we’re very clear around this.
Our distribution spending we don’t see a drop off.
There are certain components that we need to step up the level of replacements to get to the level that we think is appropriate.
So we don’t have reliability concerns.
What could cause our capital spending to go up or down were some of these other things that you see on Page 7 that would be transmission expenditures the grid readiness.
Right now that’s not in anything we’ve shown the commission.
Ted indicted that we will make a filing next year that will detail some of those expenditures.
So drop off I don’t think would be the appropriate word.
I think in our investor materials we’ve said it’s plateaued and it will go up or down depending upon what happens with some of these other things.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</strong> Okay.
So capital spending for kind of the wires business will substantially outpace depreciation for past 2017 in your view? Just the (indiscernible).
That will well pass ’17.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</strong> Okay great.
Thank you.
Next question from Travis Miller Morningstar.
Your line is open.
Inc.</strong> Good afternoon.
Hi Travis.
Inc.</strong> Quick question on the decommissioning fund do you intend to turn that over to a third-party ultimately or manage that yourself in terms of the decommission activities? Right now we have managed that as the principal owner.
That’s obviously an option.
We have seen others in the industry have done that and -- but I won’t speculate if we would go down that path.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
And then other topic those $0.23 of earnings how much of that was cash that you are realizing above and beyond the guidance? That’s a good question.
So the generator refunds were certainly cash.
FERC revenues were certainly -- will be cash.
Tax benefits the $0.08 is definitely cash … Eventually.
… eventually as it comes around and I don’t know on the $0.09 because you’re releasing reserves.
And so that’s an earnings benefit and not a cash benefit.
Inc.</strong> Okay great.
Thanks a lot.
Appreciate it.
You’re welcome.
(Operator Instructions) At this time I’m showing no questions.
Thanks very much everyone for participating on our call today and don’t hesitate to follow-up if you have any other questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That does conclude the call for today.
You may disconnect your phone lines at this time.
Good afternoon and welcome to the Edison International Third Quarter 2014 Financial Teleconference.
My name is Sheila and I'll be the operator today.
(Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thank you Sheila and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also with us are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our Web site at www.edisoninvestor.com.
After the call we will be posting Ted's and Jim's prepared remarks.
We will be filing and distributing our regular business update the week of November 3rd ahead of the EEI financial conference in Dallas.
The presentation will have the usual additional information on current topics.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
We encourage you to read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
When we get to Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
If you have further questions please return to the queue.
With that I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
I intend to keep my remarks fairly short today.
I'm pleased to report that Edison International has delivered another quarter of strong financial results with third quarter core earnings of $1.52 per share up 7% from last year.
I'm particularly pleased to note that we have also increased our full year earnings guidance.
We now anticipate 2014 core earnings will be in the range of $4.25 to $4.35 per share.
This is an increase of $0.60 per share over the midpoint of guidance we provided last February.
We continue to deliver solid growth in returns from investing in needed infrastructure to support public safety and reliability as well as California's public policy objectives of creating a low carbon economy and technological innovation.
We should note that some of the increase in our core earnings outlook for the year is made up of items such as taxes that we cannot expect will reoccur each year.
These items create a higher base against which earnings growth in the future years will look less impressive in year-over-year comparisons.
However these additional earnings increase equity which allows us to make more substantial investments in needed electric infrastructure in the future without needing to issue stock.
The high level of investment we have made over the last several years in electric infrastructure coupled with our firm belief that it was not financially prudent to issue equity to manufacture larger dividend increases has caused our dividend to fall below the industry averages for yield and earnings payout ratio.
To repeat what I've said before we are committed to bringing our dividend back into our targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings in steps over time.
We recognize that readdressing this imbalance is job number one for many of our investors.
The higher earnings outlook we announced today makes it easier to deliver on this objective.
We made important progress since our last Investor Call in resolving key uncertainties that have detracted from our longer term potential.
On October 9 the Administrative Law Judges recommended adoption of the amended SONGS settlement.
Their proposed decision found that the settlement met all of the legal requirements for comprehensive settlement and that it was reasonable in light of the whole record consistent with law and in the public interest.
There will also be oral arguments this Friday.
All of the settling parties remain in support of the settlement.
Although we do not know the timing of CPUC action the proposed decision could be considered as early as the CPUC's November 20th meeting.
The commission posts agendas 10 days prior to its meeting.
The amended SONGS settlement includes several modifications requested by the Administrative Law Judges and the Assigned Commission.
The principle change agreed to by the settling parties involved the formula for sharing any future recoveries from insurance and Mitsubishi heavy industries.
Another change added a 50:50 sharing of any financing arbitrage between the authorized 2.62% rate of return on the SONGS regulatory assets and actual financing costs.
The utilities were also asked to fund $25 million over five years for carbon-related research initiatives.
Our share of this will be $20 million and will be funded with shareholder dollars through our corporate philanthropy program.
I want to give a quick update on the NEIL insurance claims process.
Under the amended settlement customers will net of proceeds net of recovery cost I'm sorry receive 95% of any insurance proceeds related to the purchased power under what's called the outage policy.
Edison shareholders will receive 5%.
SCE has currently filed $334 million in outage insurance claims.
We don't expect to receive a first determination of coverage by the insurer until late in the year or perhaps early next.
If we disagree with NEIL's determination the policy provides for a dispute resolution process.
Under the amended settlement MHI claims would be shared 50:50 between customers and shareholders net of cost of recovery.
Our contract with Mitsubishi calls for international arbitration of disputes the three arbitrators have now been selected and the process for organizing and scheduling the arbitration has begun.
We don't intend to provide ongoing progress reports unless and until we can report material development.
We continue to expect this to be a lengthy process.
We are committed to representing our customers and our shareholders forcefully during this proceeding.
During the quarter we also completed the final steps in our settlement related to the Edison Machine Energy bankruptcy.
In late August we finalized the 2015 and 2016 payment amounts to the EME reorganization trust consistent with the settlement reached earlier this year.
The final payment increased by $9 million above our prior estimates due to an increase in the estimated tax benefits retained.
I would like to turn finally to the status of SCE's general rate case.
Evidentiary hearings have now concluded as scheduled.
Intervener testimony called for material reductions in electric system investment from what we filed.
In our policy and rebuttal testimony and in the hearings we continue to assert as the commission as supported in the past that preventative maintenance and investment in the grid maximizes customer reliability and public safety.
The current schedule continues to foreshadow a GRC decision some time in 2015.
With that I'd now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thanks Ted and good afternoon everyone.
My comments will cover third quarter and year-to-date earnings.
I will reaffirm 7% to 9% rate-based growth forecast; our increased earnings guidance and our plans for 2015 earnings guidance.
Please turn to Page 3 of the presentation.
As Ted as already mentioned the EIX's third quarter core earnings per share are $1.52 per share or $0.10 above last year.
SCE's third quarter core earnings increased $0.08 per share to $1.54 per share largely driven by higher revenues for rate-based growth.
This increase was partially offset by lower income tax benefits.
In the third quarter of last year SCE recorded benefit of $0.06 per share related to IRS guidance for generation prepared deductions.
Their earnings drivers shown right on the Slide are consistent with this year's trends of core earnings holding results.
Higher CPUC and FERC authorized revenues provide for escalation of O&amp;M return depreciation financing and taxes much of this is consistent with ongoing rate-based growth.
SONGS results are at $0.03 per share lower than the third quarter last year.
As we look ahead to 2015 we expect to recover our actual SONGS costs from the nuclear decommissioning trusts.
We have submitted an advice letter to the CPUC to access the trust and have filed our decommissioning plans with the NRC assuming the amended settlement agreement is approved by the CPUC; it provides a return on long-term debt and preferred stock which should be roughly convertible to our cost of financing the SONGS regulatory asset.
We will also share with ratepayers cost savings of any refinancing the SONGS regulatory asset at a lower – at a rate lower in the settlements authorized rate of 2.62%.
At this point in time we are not forecasting any savings between the 2.62% and the expected refinancing cost.
One thing to note as we continue to contain our O&amp;M costs which are pretty much flat with the third quarter last year after eliminating O&amp;M related to SONGS and Four Corners.
Our 2015 general rate case filing incorporates all savings from 2012 to 2014.
Going forward we have proposed sharing 50% of any 2015 savings from in-fight IT and customer service cost initiatives.
Beyond these initiatives we will continue to constantly speak to improve our cost and service performance.
Turning to Edison International parent and another as a reminder this includes the co-holding company costs new business costs under Edison Energy the remaining investments for Edison Capital which includes – which continues to wind down and two small investments at Edison Machine Energy.
Edison Capital and EME are subsidiaries of Edison Machine Group.
During the third quarter Edison Machine Group contributed $0.03 per share from affordable housing projects.
The holding company and Edison Energy costs was higher by $0.02 while we had additional tax benefit of $0.01 per share bringing the total impact from EIX parent and another to a positive $0.02 per share of earnings.
The non-core item this quarter relates to recording the completion of the EME settlement.
Please turn to Page 4.
The year-to-date increase in earnings over last year is driven by higher authorized revenues for escalation of O&amp;M return depreciation financing and taxes.
Our year-to-date earnings increase also reflects reduced O&amp;M ending from lower severance costs and higher tax benefits.
As we discussed in our second quarter call we recorded $0.09 per share tax benefit from a change in estimate of uncertain tax position.
This primarily relates to progress made with the IRS in settling the 2003 through 2006 audit cycle.
During the second quarter call we also mentioned that SCE had earned $0.03 per share for Californian energy crisis litigation settlements.
Other minor factors bring year-to-date SCE core earnings to $3.50 per share.
Net of holding company cost EIX core earnings year-to-date increased $0.52 per share to $3.50 per share.
Turning to Page 5 we updated SCE's capital expenditure forecast through 2017.
The three year forecast is about $200 million higher.
As you can see in the chart spending is forecast to be down by about $300 million in 2015 from updated CPUC's spending and timing of FERC transmission projects.
However an additional $300 million of FERC's transmission spending is now included in 2016 and 2017 for the Coolwater-Lugo and Mesa Loop-in projects.
Moreover our forecast now includes over $200 million of new spending roughly split between 2016 and 2017 to begin converting certain mobile home parks from a master meter to individually metered global homes.
This comes has a result of a March CPUC decision that ordered a pilot program to convert 10% of mobile parks are safety and reliability reason.
This pilot program is being handled outside of the general rate case process.
At this point in time it's not possible to predict if the CPUC will extend this program beyond the pilot phase.
On Page 6 we have also reaffirmed SCE 7% to 9% annual rate case growth forecast.
As we have discussed previously a rate-based growth is depending upon the CPUC's decision and SCE's 2015 general rate case.
Some interveners in the case have suggested productions some capital expenditures that will result in lower rate-based growth.
However we have progressively responded during the rate case hearings on the need for continuing and in fact increasing infrastructure spending consistent with the commissions focus on public safety and reliability.
We therefore believe the forecast range remains a reasonable one.
More information on intervener positions is included in the presentation appendix.
The final topic is guidance.
Please turn to Page 7.
We continue with the same approach to guidance that we showed you in February and again in April.
We start with the SCE rate base driven earnings estimate up $3.40 per share based on the midpoint of the rate-based forecast.
Looking across the bottom of Slide we have updated our guidance to reflect our current outlook for earnings and we have also assumed that the amended SONGS settlement is adopted this year.
Our original guidance assumed a $0.07 per share negative impact related to SONGS.
This is primarily from the lack of authorized revenues to cover the cost of debt-preferred stock.
The settlement allows a partial return to SONGS regulatory asset of 2.62% thus providing $0.03 of incremental earnings.
The amended settlement includes 5-year philanthropic contribution of the University California that totals $20 million.
Our updated guidance accrues for the 5-year charitable contribution or $0.04 per share.
There are other small items that net flow positive $0.01.
The net effective of all these items is again a negative $0.07 per share for SONGS.
The major positive items for our guidance relate to income taxes – higher income taxes benefit cost savings and other items that we previously reported in our year-to-date result.
Cost savings and other remain the largest element and we have increased from $0.35 per share in our original guidance to $0.69 per share.
Income tax benefits are now forecasted at $0.41 per share compared to $0.14 previously.
We also have removed 2014 energy efficiency earnings of $0.03 per share based on the CPUC's action delay processing of utilities energy efficiency award request.
As a result we would expect the energy efficiency awards in 2015 will include multiple years.
The combined impact of these benefits is now $1.10 per share up $0.58 per share from the original $0.52 share estimate.
We have also updated the Edison International parent and other costs estimate from $0.15 per share previously to $0.13 per share reflecting year-to-date results.
This gets us to a new core earnings midpoint of $4.30 per share and the new core earnings range of $4.25 to $4.35 per share per year as Ted as already said.
I will finish up with the comment on 2015 guidance.
Please turn to Page 8.
Based on the current GRC schedule it is not likely that SCE will receive a final GRC decision by the time we report full year results in late February of next year.
We intend to follow our prior practice of not providing 2015 earnings guidance until we receive a GRC decision.
We are mindful of the importance of helping investors model their earnings outlook even in the absence of a decision.
We believe that our rate-based forecast continues to be the best indicator of ongoing earnings power.
Thanks.
And now I will turn the call over to the operator.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Greg Gordon of ISI Group.
Your line is open.
Thanks.
Can you hear me okay? Yes Greg.
Couple of questions.
One is can you tell us whether or not the ex parte communication situation that has evolved at PG&amp;E has had any impact at all on your ability to conduct business at the CPUC and if there is any potential for either a self-policing review or an external party looking for – looking into your communications with PUC? Greg its Ted.
In terms of as that caused any kind of interruption and the business we have before the CPUC I think probably the best thing I can point to is the ongoing general rate case activities I think I mentioned in my comments that we are actually just finished up evidentiary hearings as scheduled.
So at least from what we can see there seems to be really something that's primarily focused on the San Bruno item as opposed to the activities that we have before the PUC.
So we are certainly trying to make sure that all of our personnel know what's expected of them in terms of proper conduct with the PUC.
We have compliance program.
We have training.
We have kind of redoubled efforts along those things just to make sure that that's very present in everyone's mind.
But beyond that really we are pretty much in business as usual.
I know that you haven't been approached by the Attorneys General to disclose your communications in lieu of what they are doing over ECG? No.
Okay.
Thanks.
Second question you said that you thought the energy efficiency decisions would all be multiple years of 2015.
I know you keep telling us to use the rate base math when we think about the earnings power of the company and you have exclusively not given guidance for 2015 and beyond.
Can you give us any sense of whether or not there will be items that are beyond rate base math that could potentially impact 2015 earnings and beyond? Greg this is Jim.
What we will find on doing is putting out a schedule that shows the energy efficiency potential earnings.
This is on the public domain we are just going to put it on a schedule where you can see which year was earned from and when we expect to receive it.
That will be one helpful bit of information.
But beyond that we won't predict shorter general rate case decision if there is any potential O&amp;M or tax benefit that could result in future periods.
We would assume as a working assumption a lot of that is past back as part of the rate making process.
And we will need a decision before we can really O&amp;M in that number.
Okay.
When we will see that schedule? That will probably be as part of our February where we could come out with our year end earnings.
We will provide that information.
Most of it's already in the public domain.
We are just trying to get it so people can see it in one place.
Great.
Final question when would you expect to make the next move on the dividend is it going to be in the normal cycle year coming in December? Greg this is Ted.
You are triple-dipping here today.
I think that was four something like that.
Sorry I only have one question but it's in 27 parts.
It's creative.
On the dividend I mean I think everyone knows we have typically looked at that during our December Board meeting but there is no such schedule to it.
And that's something that we really leave for the Board to make a decision on and kind of the normal course when they have all of the facts in front of them.
So there is a general practice but no such schedule.
Okay.
Thanks guys.
You are welcome.
The next question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Your line is open.
Good afternoon guys.
Hi Jonathan.
Could I just ask on the SONGS item in the guidance which is $0.07 negative but its composition is kind of different from what it was before.
If I heard you right the $0.04 piece the philanthropic contribution you booked the whole five-year thing upfront in 2014 or you intend to is that correct? Correct.
Okay.
And then the settlement is that sort of ongoing impact of the settlement or a one-time aspect of the settlement? So the return on the debt in 50% of the preferred that's what I was referring to for the $0.03 positive with the assumption we will get a decision.
So that's sort of full year impact? Yes yes.
As we think about that line going forward Jim is there and it's a slight drag from SONGS items in 2015 and beyond is that the right way to think about that? We will reset.
As we said before a couple of years ago when this got started that the rate base is going to be readjusted and the debt and preferred and the common will now be based on the actual rate base.
And we wouldn't expect that we have is separate SONGS item ongoing.
That will just going to be a feature of whatever the new guidance has? Correct.
Okay.
That's very helpful.
Thank you.
But then could I just ask on the parent and other your number to the tick down slightly is that – is it directionally where parent costs are heading? This one has been periodically its hard to predict.
We had some earnings going out from Edison Capital.
Remember we have been liquidating a low income housing portfolio there and it's hard to predict and we don't forecast earnings coming from that and periodically we get some earnings.
So that's the primary reason why the parent other was down this quarter.
But that's what we said and I will keep by that statement that it's roughly it's a little – it's a little over $0.01 per month in cost from the holding company only.
Is that what we should anticipate as a steady-state modeling outcome going forward absent some other change? I will standby by 2014.
And I don't see it changing appreciably going forward.
Okay great.
Thank you Jim.
Okay.
The next question comes from Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein.
Your line is open.
Hi.
Congratulations on a great quarter.
I'd just like to know how one achieved an increase in cost savings from $0.37 to $0.69 how does that gets up? Hugh its Jim.
Across the board a lot of different things going on higher revenues labor expense its lower tax expense for related benefits.
It's a lot of little things and remember we had higher severance expense last year lower this year.
So the year-over-year changes had a factor on it too.
So it's a number of different things.
We have been predicting all long that there would be savings coming out this year that we will pass back as part of the rate making process that we are just seeing higher level of savings than what we had originally anticipated.
These are -- one that the savings are so substantial on the rate of increase and the savings are so substantial but when it come to that kind of extrapolate into the future the possibility that you might find savings in the next general rate case budget that could allow you then to exceed your expected earnings in the GRC the coming GRC as well.
Is that a realistic expectation? Or do you think that this is just sort of one-off cut in your operating maintenance expense that really cannot be replicated in the future? Well what I did say in my script that we will continue to look for cost and service improvements.
The key thing that's not available here is in terms of what the commission decides is going to be the O&amp;M levels and our spending levels for 2015 2016 and 2017.
What the attrition mechanism might be for 2016 and 2017 those unknowns.
So I think that's why we have been taking you back in my comments for 2015 guidance was the one thing that we have a higher degree of confidence around is the rate-based forecast.
And that's the true driver of earnings and we may have some transitory earnings or potential losses depending upon things how they evolve in both O&amp;M and tax benefit.
But the rate base is the true one guide towards a future earnings.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Okay Hugh.
The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.
Your line is open.
Hi.
Good afternoon.
Hi Julien.
So following up on the GRC if you will what's the latest timeline could you give us a little bit of an update on where we stand just given everything going on in the CPUC? And then perhaps the follow-up question and I will stick with just one follow-up here.
How could that potentially impact the CapEx on the various timing outcomes of the GRC here? Yes.
Julien its Jim.
It's a good question.
We concluded Ted said today hearings.
That was an important milestone.
And the next real key thing we got coming up we have update hearings unless they change them in January don't we Maria Pedro? That is the last bit of information where the update for known changes that have occurred and there are some hearings around that.
And then you got to get into filing your briefs and your closing briefs reply briefs.
And then it's on to the judges for drafting of the proposed decision.
Normally just if you go back in prior years the update hearings were typically in November of the year.
So it looks like we're at least two maybe three months behind just from looking at that schedule.
But I can't predict once we turn it over to the LJ's how long it's going to take them prepare the proposed decision.
That is the key unknown.
Your second question thank you for keeping to two.
The capital expenditures part of what we do is we look out over the three year period and we tend to send our capital expenditures so we can have a steady state of work.
If you go back and look over the last couple of years we have been challenged to ramp-up our capital expenditures to reflect the level that was authorized and it had a lot to do with getting the crews in place in order to get the constant steady state of work.
And we are trying to maintain that constant steady state of work without dropping back to a lower level of capital expenditures because we don't have certainty.
So our view is if they do come in in lower capital expenditures you can adjust your rate of spending in the prior year so beyond 2015 so 2016 and 2017.
So we have some flexibility around and how you schedule things over that three year period.
But we were trying to maintain a level of overall expenditures at this higher level because it really reflects a lot of work to get the crews ramped up to where we are today.
But ultimately it seems like the timeline on the actual rate case doesn't seem to be too impacted by the latest development if I hear you correctly? Yes.
I think that's how we are going to operate the business.
We are going to launch our O&amp;M spending obviously because O&amp;M is different and capital – three years to deal with capital.
We only have one year for O&amp;M.
So we are very much carefully watch our O&amp;M.
But our capital we want to maintain at the levels we have identified in our documents.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Okay Julien.
The next question comes from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.
Your line is open.
Hi good afternoon guys.
Hi Dan.
Just following up on Hugh's question is kind of that you have pretty remarkable improvement in O&amp;M cost management.
Can you just remind us how those adjustments are kind of that better starting point from this year gets reflected in kind of the GRC process given the relatively short open period for adjustment and docket tweaks that sort of stuff? So really it's just part of the rate case process no update for – they are looking at forecast and they look at some actuals because they will be able to go beyond them.
The record doesn't close until next year.
And so you would expect them to pick-up a lot of the factors that we have this year.
And then whatever they decide from there it's hard to predict at this point in time.
Well where they will set the actual level of O&amp;M until you actually get a proposed decision on a filed decision.
And along those lines Jim did I hear you correctly saying that you guys would split 50:50 if you had more IT and some other savings in 2015 and beyond? So we said we had some specific things that we have identified as part of the rate case process.
And we offered those up as part of our showing within the rate case and said we will share 50% of the savings.
And I also said that we will continue to look for additional cost savings.
And so that's – so those are the facts as they are today.
And just one last one Ted on the payout ratio should we be thinking about that 45% to 55% based on the rate base math what earnings would be – as do you guys provide it right now or should we assume that if you start realizing better earned ROEs because some of the operating efficiency savings that that is where you calibrate your payout ratio? Yes.
There is always I guess I will say unpredictable pluses and minuses.
So what we really tend to do is just make it straightforward.
It's based on the rate base that's really the durable growth and the durable earnings power of the company.
And that to us seems to be the appropriate way to kind of think about the 45% to 55% payout ratio.
Obviously like in the case of this year if you have additional earnings from taxes or whatever it maybe now that just builds your equity and makes it stronger balance sheet from which to finance the type of significant electric infrastructure investments that we see in the future as suppose puts you in better financial strength and our balance sheet strength provides I think more certainty that you can manage the growth in electrics infrastructure investment without having to tap the equity markets which as you know is something we've really try to keep in balance.
Got it.
Thank you guys.
Okay Dan.
The next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Your line is open.
Hey guys.
One thing just thinking this is a little bit follow-on the rate case question.
In the rate case filing is the O&amp;M that you requested higher or lower than kind of – if I would have taken annualized run rate for what O&amp;M has been at SCE so far in 2014? I don't know if I can answer the question Michael.
You have to go back compare.
We have been driving the O&amp;M down.
And as I said in my prepared comments you are taking SONGS out and we are taking Four Corners out and so you would expect based on that the trajectory is lower.
But trying to line it up exactly I don't think I can do it right here.
Okay.
Just trying to think about – are you incurring costs that you had already filed for in the rate case? Or if the rate case has higher 2015 O&amp;M versus 2014 it's for costs you are not already incurring.
So if you are not authorized the revenues that go with those costs – it's not like you've got to go through a major cost-cutting exercise.
It all depends on what they authorize in the end Michael.
Got it.
So I understand the crux of your question in terms of where we are spending relative to what's in the GRC.
It ultimately then goes to what they authorize.
Okay.
On energy efficiency for 2015 and beyond since you are not recognizing any of it in 2014 does that mean 2015 could be a little bit of a catch-up year where you recognize both 2014 and 2015 in that one year? Or are you just kind of going to skip a year? I think that's how we are thinking about it now you may have pancaking of years.
Got it.
Okay.
Thanks Jim.
Much appreciated.
Okay Michael.
The next question comes from Kit Konolige of BGC Partners.
Your line is open.
Good afternoon guys.
Just I think a lot of this has been asked already.
But Jim maybe -- I'm not sure I caught a lot of detail about the positive tax impacts that we're seeing so far.
Is it possible to explain those in a non-technical way that would give us some idea of what's driving that and how sustainable they might be? Yes.
I didn't give a lot of details.
You didn't miss it.
We see additional repair deductions.
So when you have work like pull loading or infrastructure replacement you have repair deductions.
You get faster deductions for tax purposes.
And we are continuing to see those come through and we have been running behind in terms of what are our original expectation was in that area.
We see additional property tax reductions.
There are a number of different taxes here.
Cost of removal deductions so there is a number of different pieces here so it doesn't add up to one item being large but all of them together selectively made a significant change from what we had previously forecasted.
But they all – moving up in the same direction that it comes out to a pretty significant dollar amount.
Is that related – does that relate to anything that's unusual about your capital spend or acceleration of CapEx or anything like that? Or is this just how the tax laws happen to be written? There is more the nature of what the capital expenditures are.
It has to do with more of our expenditures and as we are – we are ramping up now for infrastructure replacement and pull loading expenditures qualify for repair deductions and cost of removals.
And we are seeing details relative to what we had in our forecast in the current year receipts.
So that's why you are seeing these earnings pop out for this year.
Great.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Okay Kit.
The next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust.
Your line is open.
Thank you.
Jim just to put that bucket in your earnings guidance the $1.10 of incremental earnings that you are picking up this year – can you just remind us how much of that was picked up in the third quarter and then year-to-date? Of the $1.10 and I don't know if I could break it out completely.
I can give you some numbers that we have seen previously.
We said back in the second quarter there were $0.23 of earnings that were outside of our guidance.
You can back into that from that number.
And beyond that its more difficult to break it out by quarters what was in the third what we anticipate being in the fourth.
But the closest I can give you right now Ali.
Okay.
And then second am I correct? When I looked at the rate base numbers in your latest slide deck specifically for 2015 and 2016 compared them to the last time you had given us those numbers there's about a $400 million per year reduction in the ranges for 2015 and 2016.
Am I correct in that calculation? Yes.
There are some changes going on as I said in my prepared comments we are shifting dollars out of 2015.
And so they are going into 2016 and 2017 and there is a net increase in overall capital expenditures because we have a new program for converting mobile home parks from master meters to individually metered mobile homes.
So its affecting both capital then ultimate rate base.
Okay.
But again if I add in 2017 to the mix it seems that you only pick up about $100 million to $200 million there and you are reducing about $400 million in each of the years 2015 and 2016.
So over the three-year period it looks like a net reduction if I'm looking at it right.
Yes.
It's hard to – it really has go into how that actual closings are being forecasted so as we have capital expenditures and then ultimately closings and how it relates to rate base.
So I don't have any further detail I can give you on that that could change periodically.
I see.
Last question sorry for that.
On Slide 12 where you talk about some of your growth CapEx initiatives beyond 2017 just to put that in some context does that sustain your rate base growth at the same level based on all the items you've listed on that Slide 12? Yes.
We haven't put out a forecast or rate base real figures.
What we have been trying to indicate that $4 billion year capital expenditure is kind of like the sweet spot.
Ted has mentioned that previously.
And so we see infrastructure replacement going up in spending transmission has come down a little bit.
And we have some of these other initiatives that are on the periphery the horizon that we were thinking about now that could affect our overall capital expenditures beyond the 2017 timeframe.
So I'm not trying to go to higher net of level capital expenditures.
And I'm not providing you actual CAGRs and you would expect as the base gets bigger your CAGR will probably come down slightly just from the math on.
Right.
Thank you.
Okay.
The next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Citigroup.
Your line is open.
Hi everyone.
Hi Shah.
I think we – just on two filings I think we discussed in the past that there's potentially two filings next year: one distribution resource plan under AB 327; and then another proposal to potentially look to do electric vehicle charging stations.
Is this sort of above your 7% to 9% rate base growth or is it embedded in the numbers? Can it move the needle? I think it's a good question.
I think the timeframe maybe out slightly as you get into when those might take effect.
And obviously you have to file an application the application is going to take time to process.
And I couldn't anticipate that it would be well in the 2016 potentially 2017 before you actually see spending from either of those two initiatives.
And so it's hard at this point in time to forecast that it might push it higher than where we are forecasting today.
Got you.
Got you.
And then just a follow-up.
On the MHI proceedings are you bound by ordinance to remain – to not disclose the process? Or is this sort of like you just want to update investors once you have some data point to update investors with? What's the procedural process there? We are going to have Rob Adler our General Counsel comment on that.
Bob? These proceedings are typically confidential in nature.
It would take the parties to agree to make them otherwise as well as the tribunal.
And so at this point in time we are simply not going to be commenting beyond the material events that would – that would require disclosure.
Terrific.
Thanks.
Congrats on a good quarter.
Okay Shah.
Thanks  The next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.
Your line is open.
Thank you.
I just have a quick question on GRC.
Now that the hearings are over and the commissioner assigned to the rate case is not going to be around past the end of – I mean of the CPUC – at the end of this year is it possible that we would have a settlement instead of a fully litigated case? Angie its Jim.
I don't think we can speculate on that.
Of course if it were appropriate we would enter in discussions but we can't comment beyond what we know now.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay.
Talk to you then.
The next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar.
Your line is open.
Good afternoon.
Thank you.
Hi Travis.
The income tax benefit that you've been realizing – how much if any ultimately would go back to ratepayers either through the GRC or some other type of mechanism? Travis this is Jim.
We have been forecasting and signaling clear that we would expect the tax benefits we realized during this year see to go back to customers.
And that's a part of the rate case process.
And so we are not indicating that would expect earnings from tax benefits going forward.
And that would ultimately show up in a lower revenue requirement? Sure.
They will just for the benefits yes they will take it away lower the revenue requirement already incorporated in our GRC request.
Got it.
And then another subject maybe Ted what's your latest thinking on the FERC Order 1000 projects? Is that in a planning stage for you guys or is that too far off to think about? Well certainly not in a place where we think we would have something to disclose about it.
But we have indicated previously that competitive transmission if you will FERC order 1000 base transmission projects is something that we are seriously considering and looking at.
We have a subsidiary that we've formed Edison Transmission which is really to explore those possibilities and should something come together then we of course would have more to say about it.
But at this point I think like most companies out there we are looking at it trying to assess where the opportunities are.
We have ourselves kind of organized to go after these things in a logical way if we see good projects that make good sense.
Then presumably we would go forward and those.
Okay great.
Thanks a lot.
Okay Travis.
The next question comes from Neel Mitra - Tudor Pickering.
Your line is open.
Pickering</strong> Hi.
Good afternoon.
Just wanted to get your thoughts on the probability of the renewable portfolio standard going over 33% and what the timing of that would be and what possible investment generally that would require from you going forward.
This is Ted.
It's going to be difficult to really speculate much on this.
We were currently of course focused on trying to get to the 33%.
And we have procurement efforts and the like to get us there.
Whether this becomes something that either the Governor's Office or legislator just want to look at that's really hard to predict I'm not aware of any specific bills that are being put together or floated at this point.
So it's really just hard to speculate on it.
Pickering</strong> Okay.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions) And it appears that was the last question.
I will now turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone for participating.
And please call our Investor Relations if you have any follow-up questions.
Thanks and good evening.
That concludes today's conference.
Thanks for participating.
You may disconnect at this time.
Good afternoon and welcome to the Edison International fourth quarter 2014 financial teleconference.
[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks operator and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also here are the members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-K are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
After the call we will be posting Ted's and Jim's prepared remarks.
Tomorrow afternoon we will distribute our regular business update presentation for use in upcoming investor meetings.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
Please read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
During Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
I'll now turn the call over to Ted Craver.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
We closed a good 2014 on a strong note.
We delivered excellent financial performance.
We resolved two major uncertainties Edison Mission Energy and San Onofre.
We meaningfully increased the dividend.
We continued to fulfill the long term growth opportunity at Southern California Edison through our wires-focused investment strategy that supports California’s environmental and growth objectives and we continued to selectively pursue growth opportunities that allow us to serve additional customers outside of SCE’s service territory.
Most gratifying to me is that we delivered on what we told investors we would do.
I’m proud of this leadership team and the outstanding work of our employees.
That said we fully recognize that 2014 is over and we are in a new year.
We need to build on the performance of 2014 and continue to build value.
With the strong fourth quarter full year 2014 core earnings were $4.59 per share an increase of 21% over the previous year.
This result was well above our updated guidance from last fall.
Jim Scilacci will cover the details in his comments.
The settlements reached on the EME bankruptcy and SONGS order instituting investigation position us to move forward decisively in a time of tremendous change in our industry.
The unanimous approval by the California Public Utilities Commission of the SONGS settlement agreement last November demonstrated that it is possible to resolve complex and important regulatory matters through settlement.
The settlement was the product of tough negotiations among the initial settling parties: the Utility Reform Network or TURN; the Office of Rate Payer Advocate; and the two utilities and later other interveners signed on to the settlement.
The settlement has been widely supported as fair and balanced.
SCE is now proceeding with implementation of the approved agreement.
We are also deeply engaged in the planning and early stages of decommissioning the plant.
SCE will continue to work aggressively to maximize potential financial recoveries from insurers and from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
I’m hopeful SCE will be able to resolve the insurance claims this year.
Under the provisions of the settlement agreement virtually all insurance proceeds if any will go to customers.
The arbitration process with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries must follow International Chamber of Commerce rules which means it will be a slower process.
I don’t expect any decision until 2016.
The MHI arbitration proceeding is confidential so we won’t be able to say much.
However we continue to assert the claims we first presented to the International Chamber of Commerce in 2013.
Our nearly 18% dividend increase in early December underscores our optimism about the future and our commitment to bringing our dividend payout closer to that of the industry.
We expect to extend our record of 11 years of annual dividend increases while stepping up the pace of dividend growth to exceed that of earnings.
This will allow us to return to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of earnings in steps over time.
Let me now provide some longer-term thoughts.
On January 5 in his State of the State speech Governor Brown outlined his broad goals for the next stage in addressing climate change.
By 2030 he wants to derive 50% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources reduce petroleum and cars and trucks by 50% and double the efficiency of existing buildings.
In his speech he said “All of this is a very tall order.
It means that we continue to transform our grid our transportation system and even our communities.” He continued saying “I envision a wide range of initiatives: more distributed power expanded rooftop solar micro grids an energy imbalance market batter storage the full integration of information technology and electrical distribution and millions of electric and low carbon vehicles.” But the state’s ambition and overall direction is clear.
In broad strokes we at Edison have been painting a similar picture of the future of the power system.
Importantly our growth strategy is aligned accordingly.
Of course the devil’s in the details.
Some of the regulatory framework to implement this vision will require legislative action and that process has already started in Sacramento.
We will be actively engaged on the legislative front.
One of our larger priorities will be achieving policy goals at the lowest cost to customers.
We see the need to expand California’s renewable portfolio standard beyond the current regime of only recognizing large scale wholesale contracted projects to recognize the benefits of distributed generation energy efficiency and electric vehicle charging.
The three-year general rate case cycle provides a broad framework to incorporate other initiatives such as the distribution resource plan required to be filed this summer.
The CPUC recently issued its final guidance on the distribution plan elements.
We anticipate that our plan will create something of a roadmap for the distribution system investments at Southern California Edison needed to realize the governor’s vision.
Some elements of the plan are already in process including initiatives on energy storage residential rate design and electric vehicle charging.
California’s commitment to creating a low carbon economy does not necessarily conflict with SCE’s core mission of delivering safe reliable and affordable electricity.
SCE’s current general rate case will establish the revenue requirement and scope of work to achieve both.
The record for the rate case was completed in late January.
The GRC is now in the hands of the administrative law judges to develop a proposed decision.
We expect a decision sometime in 2015.
So with that I’ll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.
Thanks Ted.
Good afternoon everyone.
My comments will cover fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and cost of capital.
As we have previously stated we will not provide 2015 earnings guidance until SCE receives its 2015 general rate case decision.
In this presentation I will however discuss assumptions relevant to our 2015 earnings.
Please turn to page two.
In the fourth quarter of 2014 SCE earned $1.09 per share or $0.30 ahead of last year.
This increase was driven by many of the same factors we have been seeing during 2014 including higher revenue of $0.28 partially offset by depreciation of $0.08 net tax benefits and other items of $0.04 and O&amp;M savings of $0.05.
There are also two items of note that are included in the $0.28 of higher revenue and both of them were not included in our updated earnings guidance that we provided last October.
First we recorded $0.05 of additional revenue from resolution of an open item from our 2012 GRC decision.
During 2014 SCE obtained an IRS private letter ruling regarding appropriate treatment of net operating loss carryforwards.
The net effect of the ruling was to increase CPUC rate base and revenues.
In November we obtained a CPUC approval authorizing the additional revenues.
Second you may recall that during the third quarter call we thought that the energy efficiency awards might be delayed until 2015.
As things turned out we received our award in December and it amounted to $0.04 per share.
In the fourth quarter the net SONGS impact on core earnings was a positive $0.02 per share compared to last year.
Our fourth quarter results include recognition of revenue for the rate of return on the SONGS regulatory asset.
We also had a $0.05 benefit from lower O&amp;M costs.
The largest item was lower severance expense.
Taxes and other items were a net benefit of $0.04 per share led by $0.07 in higher income tax benefits.
Most of this relates to repair deductions that we talked about previously.
At the Edison International parent company level results were a loss of $0.01 per share compared to income of $0.02 per share last year which is mainly due to the income from Edison Capital and tax benefits.
The loss of $0.01 this quarter includes higher income from Edison Capital and lower tax benefits.
As we have indicated Edison Capital’s remaining low income housing portfolio continues to wind down as units are sold.
Turning to noncore items SCE recorded a net $0.08 per share benefit during the fourth quarter from a revised estimate of the impact of the SONGS settlement.
There are a number of items that make up the $0.08 including the return on SONGS regulatory asset from April 1 through September 30 of this year and an accrual of a contribution to the University of California for greenhouse gas research.
At the parent we also recorded $0.12 per share benefit in discontinued operations related to resolution of uncertain tax positions from settlement of our 2003 to 2006 federal income tax years and other tax impacts related to EME.
As a reminder EIX has net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards from EME that will be monetized in future years as part of our settlement with EME creditors.
These tax benefits were approximately $1.1 billion at year end.
We also recorded $0.01 per share net benefit at the holding company related to allocation of income tax attributes to tax equity investors and projects developed by SoCore Energy on what is called the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value or HLBV accounting method.
Because HLBV accounting procedures produces income not related to project portfolio performance we classify this income as noncore.
Please turn to page three.
For the full year core earnings were $4.59 per share versus $3.80 in 2013.
For SCE this improvement is mainly due to rate base growth.
Year-end 2014 rate base was $23.3 billion a $2.2 billion increase over the prior year.
In addition SCE recorded higher net tax benefits totaling $0.16 per share principally from repair deductions and resolution of uncertain tax positions.
A number of other smaller items complete the picture.
At the holding company core losses were comparable to last year at $0.09 per share.
This remains lower than expected primarily due to higher income from Edison Capital.
I know many of you are interested in tracking our earnings relative to our guidance so I’ll cover that next.
Please turn to page four.
This slide shows a reconciliation of core earnings to guidance over the full year period.
I will focus on the final three months of the year that took us from $4.30 midpoint guidance in October to actual core earnings of $4.59.
As you can see the increase is $0.29.
First it’s $0.10 per share of income tax benefits from additional repair and cost of removal deductions recorded in the fourth quarter.
Next are the two items I mentioned earlier the $0.05 per share benefit from the revised determination of rate base and $0.04 of energy efficiency awards.
The balance relates to cost savings and a number of small items at $0.05 per share.
Holding company core results were $0.04 per share better than expected primarily due to Edison Capital’s affordable housing project revenues.
Please turn to page five.
SCE’s capital spending forecast changed slightly from our prior forecast due to timing of transmission capital expenditures.
Actual 2014 capital spending totaled $4 billion $100 million below our forecast.
Our outlook for 2015 spending is down $100 million and up $200 million in 2016.
Please note we continue to use the 12% variability between the range and request capital expenditure forecast.
Please turn to page six.
Our rate base forecast remains consistent with the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rates.
Based on a number of changes we’ve revised downward our rate base forecast by a net $300 million by 2017.
As the slide shows this reflects an average reduction of $400 million from bonus depreciation an average reduction of $100 million for timing of transmission spending and a positive $200 million adjustment upward to update deferred taxes related to our SmartConnect project.
Please note that the capital spending and rate base forecasts do not include electric vehicle charging energy storage or distribution resource planned expenditures.
The lion’s share of this future spending will likely occur beyond the current forecast period.
Please turn to page seven.
This page updates the interest rate trends for the CPUC cost of capital trigger mechanism.
Recently CPUC approved a one-year extension of our cost of capital mechanism.
We must now file our 2017 cost of capital application in April 2016.
The trigger mechanism will remain in effect for 2016.
However based on the movement of the Moody’s BAA bond index thus far it seems unlikely that the current return on common equity of 10.45% would change for 2016.
Our FERC filed rate settlement remains in place through the end of 2017.
Under the settlement the return on common equity can be reopened after June 30 of this year.
Next I’d like to touch on some financial considerations related to 2015 earnings given the absence of guidance.
Please turn to page eight.
On this page we have included some important factors to consider in refining your earnings estimates until we can provide formal guidance.
The capital spending and rate base forecasts are taken from pages four and five of this presentation.
Both CPUC and FERC return on common equity remain unchanged at 10.45%.
We have some carryover items on energy efficiency awards from prior years.
The potential earnings opportunity for 2015 is up to $0.05 rather than the more typical $0.03 per single year.
Please keep in mind that some of the carryover items will likely be contested by other parties and there is no assurance that energy efficiency earnings will be approved.
Another positive item is the completion in January of the SONGS regulatory assets financing.
The approved settlement let SCE finance this asset with 100% debt.
The settlement also requires that we share with our customers the cost savings of this financing if the rate is below the 2.62% return on the regulatory asset.
SCE completed this financing with a weighted average cost of debt of 2.2%.
The blended average rate increases over time due to debt amortization.
After the cost sharing with customers there is a very modest earnings benefit.
However the financing has the added benefit of ultimately freeing up approximately $400 million of common equity.
As we recover the regulatory asset this amount will decline over time.
At year-end 2014 SCE’s 13-month weighted average equity ratio for regulatory purposes was 48.4%.
The SONGS regulatory asset totaled $1.288 billion at year-end 2014.
Of this amount $919 million earns the 2.62% return $345 million earns a commercial paper rate and the balance earns no return.
For 2015 and beyond we believe that the return on SONGS regulatory assets will roughly match the financing costs.
I will also remind you that our quarter earnings results will not reflect the revenues requested in the 2015 GRC and accordingly won’t have the typical profile during the year.
Until we receive a final GRC decision we plan to record revenues based on the 2014 authorized revenue requirement.
Please turn to page nine.
The next slide highlights the details of our dividend policy that Ted has already touched on.
I’d like to reinforce our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among large cap utilities for rate base earnings and dividend growth.
Please turn to page ten.
This last slide captures our strategic framework.
Ted has touched on many of the major points already.
To summarize we are very focused on delivering on our organic growth opportunity.
We have good growth visibility from our wire spending and the prospect for continued growth from a number of new initiatives.
Moreover as we have previously said we will continue to work to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency.
Thanks.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
[Operator instructions.] The first question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS.
I wanted to ask kind of a bigger picture question here as we’re thinking about this roadmap that you all are getting ready to file.
And I hear you in the broader elements here.
You’ve got storage you’ve got efficiency you’ve got renewables in the background.
What’s going to be different versus the individual dockets here that we have filed? How does this bring it together? How does this from your perspective change the capital spending plan? And perhaps it’s the different time period but just could you elaborate a little bit? I’ll start out then I’ll turn it over to Pedro for some additional comments.
So the filing is coming up in the second quarter or the first part of the third quarter and we have a series of questions that PUC has asked us to address.
A lot of them are really what’s happening in the system and how we plan to address it to encourage and incorporate more distributed energy resources in a distribution system.
At least the initial filing is not an investment filing.
It’s really a description of what needs to be done and from our view.
Others will have I’m sure different views.
We will subsequently follow that up with probably some type of application or alternatively we’ll include in our 2018 general rate case request the actual expenditures associated with this new plan.
And from an overall perspective stepping back and thinking about our capital expenditures we’ve said that capital expenditures on average have been running about $4 billion a year.
And we don’t want to suggest that these new programs either will take it up or drop it down.
We think that generally going forward capital expenditures will stay in that same zone even with these new initiatives.
So I’ll pause there and turn it over to Pedro for additional elaboration if you’d like to add anything.
No Jim I think you covered it very well.
And the July 1 filing has a fairly [unintelligible] set of questions that the PUC has posed and they really go to the nuts and bolts of how will the grid need to evolve in order to accommodate deployment of distributed energy resources and look at the grid’s capacity to integrate them look at things like the [locational] value at various points across our grid.
And so a piece of this is mechanical but there’s a broader piece around how does the grid continue to evolve and [unintelligible] raise questions and provide some insights on what are some of the technologies and what’s the evolution of that grid over time.
And then as Jim said we haven’t determined this yet but we’ll have the option of either including investment opportunities that we see in our future rate case cycles.
Potentially there might be an opportunity to do a separate filing if we saw a very pressing near term need but that’s work that we have underway right now in determining what those next steps are and developing the filing for July 1.
Excellent.
And perhaps a follow up and once again congratulations on the overall results for the year but given how successful the cost savings were particularly relative to the October 28 guidance what exactly is that saying year over year for the run rate through most of this year in terms of the cost savings.
In the [unintelligible] sense/other is there any way to read that into 2015 without providing guidance here? We can’t.
We have the general rate case.
We really have to answer that first question how the PUC establishes the authorized level of revenue requirements then we’ll have an opportunity after that to come back out and give you our views on what it could be.
But I just want to emphasize we will continue as I said in my script to look for opportunities to reduce our costs.
Your next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Jim maybe just on the slide eight of the factors.
So just simplistically would you suggest a simple kind of rate base times equity times ROE plus the energy efficiency and no AFDC earnings we should assume and nothing meaningfully from the SONGS items? And that’s as simple as that? Yeah I think that’s what we’re strongly suggesting you go towards because you have visibility on rate base and rate base growth and then return on common equity obviously is not changing.
We’re not changing the share count.
The energy efficiency is going to be somewhere in that 3% to 5% range and we won’t know until later on in the year if there’s an opportunity for anything beyond that or the hurdle that we’re going to have to climb over.
So I think that’s the best and safest way to do it for now.
And I guess the one other missing piece is just the parent drag which came in a little bit better with this Edison Capital income.
Is that something that we should continue to see get a little better or should we go back to the $0.10 to $0.15 that’s typically been a drag? I think we’ve indicated that the parent spending is a little over a penny a month and we see that’s probably the appropriate level.
And what’s been happening either tax benefits or sale of property through Edison Capital has come through.
And we don’t forecast the Edison Capital side.
It’s more serendipity if anything else.
So I think it’s better to look at the actual run rate of costs absent these other things.
Your next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium.
Jim what you’re suggesting is that the SONGS will reap zero earnings per share to the bottom line? Yeah I should have mentioned that.
Steve asked that question.
Thanks for picking it up.
And what I said in my prepared remarks was we believe that the return on the regulatory asset that portion that’s earning 2.62% and the financing that we put in place they tend to offset one another.
So therefore there won’t be any earnings going to the bottom line for San Onofre going forward.
The other piece we talked about there’s a significant amount of nuclear fuel which we were already financing with 100% debt at a commercial paper rate.
So that seems to be match funded.
So net-net I don’t see any change from that going forward that we should expect any earnings from San Onofre besides the cost.
Scott want to add anything? Just the other thing just to remind everyone we had already taken SONGS out of the rate base at the time of our announcement.
So it has been out for some period of time so the rate base comparisons are apples and apples.
And then secondly Jim the equity ratio that you gave us the 13-month average did that take out SONGS through this new financing mechanism that you mentioned? So SONGS is out of it and you’re at 48.4? Did I hear that correct? So SONGS doesn’t come out of the regulatory capital structure until after we did the financing.
So it’s included in the 48.4 that I mentioned and now it comes out when we do the financing.
And the financing wasn’t completed until January so when we release first quarter earnings you’ll be able to see the actual equity ratio based say on SONGS.
So that would then theoretically increase the equity ratio right once that thing goes out? Am I correct? Yes.
Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.
Wondered if you could just talk at a high level about the latest data play in terms of the dialog on net metering policy.
I know there’s a proceeding and review underway but I’m just curious as you see the debate continue to unfold any comments you might have on that debate.
We’re in the midst of a multiple phase at the commission and it’s teed up.
The next slate of decisions we’ll be getting from the commission has to do with the [fixed] charges and the tiers and then after that we have the net energy metering the new tariff associated with that.
And I’ll pause here and look over at Pedro.
Is there anything else? Maybe the timeframe of when we’re expecting it? I think you covered it right.
I think on the tiers and [unintelligible] charges we’re expecting a determination from the commission in the second quarter if things stay on good timing.
And then the NEM would be later in the year.
Okay so we’ll just watch that.
I guess just separately away from the utility as you think about your renewables strategy broadly again outside of the utility as you see the business continuing to evolve any high level thoughts we should be thinking about? I know you’ve talked a lot in the past about looking at how the business is going to change and obviously there’s a lot of changes on the utility side but just curious outside of that anything lately in terms of strategic thinking on renewables beyond the utility? I’ll take a crack at this.
Very broadly speaking as I kind of indicated in my opening comments we see the potential in the competitive businesses to serve customers outside of the 50 000 square mile territory of Southern California Edison.
Most of the work that we’ve done up to this point has been focused more on commercial and industrial customers outside of the territory.
Second to that I would say are various potential electrification initiatives.
So these would be projects that would further electrification.
We think that actually fits into a lot of the effort across the country but particularly here in California to move towards a low carbon economy moving towards higher levels of electrification in say the transportation sector goods movement water some of the other areas.
All of that helps move the economy towards a lower carbon footprint.
So those are kind of the second bucket of areas that we’re continuing to look at.
Final point I’ll make is we’ve tried to be fairly high level about the things that we’re looking at on that side.
I think you know us well enough by now we don’t like to come out with a lot of fanfare up front.
We’d rather see what we can deliver and then talk about that.
So at this point most of the effort is on the distributed generation activities around SoCore and how that fits into our kind of broader strategy on the commercial and industrial customer side.
Your next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
You all have mentioned on a couple of occasions the governor’s vision for the upgrading of the grid and also the need to continue to replace aging components and improve the reliability of your existing grid.
Looking forward to your capex program in a longer timeframe would you be surprised to see the more or less $4.5 billion rate of capex that you’re forecasting for 2015 2016 2017 to continue into the next GRC or would you be expecting factors to come into play that would move that $4.5 billion materially up or materially down? I think what we’re attempting to say and I struggled with it in an earlier question my response was I think the $4 billion is probably in the right zone and we’ll just have to see how things unfold.
If you go through the piece parts distribution has been stepping up in the total level of expenditures over the last several GRCs and we’re still working to get our replacement rates to levels that we think we need to be at to maintain the reliability of the electric system.
So you could see distribution step up somewhat more from where we are today.
Transmission is related to some of these large projects that we have flowing through and we had very modest transmission spending in years past and that stepped up as a result of all the renewable interconnections that we were doing.
Generation has typically been a very small part of our overall equation.
It was really just replacement capital expenditures mainly at our nuclear plants and it’s dropped down to maybe about $100 million a year.
Going forward we’ll have to see as we lay out the distribution resources plan how significant and how fast the commission would want to move to make some of these improvements.
We’ve put out numbers on the electric vehicle charging.
It’s approximately $350 million over a multiyear period of time.
There’s some storage expenditures.
So I think it’s best and safest to assume that that $4 billion is probably the appropriate level until we can get more information in the public domain.
Let me just throw in one other piece.
I think a big consideration here is how fast you want to move towards modernizing the grid converting it from largely an electromechanical system to a more digitized system capable of two-way flows of electricity so on and so forth all the stuff you’ve heard us talk about before.
If you envision doing that over a three to five year period then I think you’ll probably be looking at higher numbers.
If you envision doing that over a five to seven year period it tamps it down a little bit.
If you envision doing it over a ten year period more modest yet.
So I think a big component of trying to sort this through is the pace with which these investments get made not just the absolute number.
Your next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
My question Ted perhaps for you wanted to dial a little more into your thinking on the dividend.
And when you talk about getting to your targeted payout ratio over time there’s a range there to get you know to the middle of that range.
But the reason I bring it up is when we run the math on the rate base math as Jim alluded to for the core earnings power of the utility it’s going to be significantly lower than what you’ve reported in 2014 with all the tax benefits and cost savings etc.
that we had to [unintelligible] in the GRC.
So arguably one could argue you’re pretty much close to the low end of that range if you run the math along those lines.
So I’m just curious when you talk about still stepping up what is it that you’re envisioning for this dividend? You’ve put your finger on a really good point.
I think we’ve tended to think of it more in terms of what I would call the sustainable or durable earnings.
It’s always hard to predict certainly 2014 was a good case of it just how much you’re going to have in the way of some of these other earnings points.
And of course I guess it’s possible you could have years where you end up having some of the more unusual items that work against you but fundamentally we kind of look at it as the core earnings power of the utility and the dividend is tied to SCE’s earnings.
It really is the rate base model.
So that’s the way we tend to look at it.
All of that said you’ll see continued significant growth in rate base and therefore we see good growth in earnings.
And in order to move the payout ratio up we expect the growth rate in dividend increases to be higher than the growth rate in earnings.
Otherwise we won’t make any progress on moving the payout ratio up.
Understood.
But just to clarify the goal is not to necessarily just get to the lower end and say hey we’re there.
The goal is to be somewhere in the middle of that range that you’ve given us? Well of course I won’t take the bait to pinpoint where it will be inside the 45% to 55% payout ratio but that’s the target that we’ve had and I think we look at all of the factors including what do we see the forward run rate in rate base growth because that’s really what will drive earnings.
And as I’ve said we see good solid growth in rate base therefore earnings therefore dividends.
And second question if I could unrelated to that Jim when you talked about that penny a month sort of run rate drag for the parent just remind me does that include any contribution from your non-utility activity sort of in there? And assuming your vision plays out as you expect for the non-utility business when do you think you’d be in a position to break that out as a separate segment? It’s a good question on breaking out the separate segment.
It’s too small now to justify doing that.
We tried to provide when you look at the K some additional information in terms of the investment levels.
But a little bit more than $0.01 a month was just in totality on a normal run rate basis and it excluded activities at Edison Capital which are very hard to forecast or predict.
So without Edison Capital and any other tax benefits we think in the normal course we’d be hitting about a little over a penny a month.
So you can do the math there and it’s consistent with what we’ve said in the past.
The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Jim just kind of a quick update.
You’ve got a significant under-recovered fuel balance kind of the ERA that’s outstanding.
Can you talk about whether that ERA will grow some more meaning the under-recovered balance will become a larger balance or when that will convert to cash for SoCal Ed? Good question.
There’s many parts associated with that and I think when you have a chance to take a look at our K there’s a full description in our disclosures that breaks down the piece parts.
But we’re hoping if the commission renders a final decision in the 2015 ERA proceeding which is before them now that we should be fully collected in our under-collection by year-end.
And the piece parts coming to help that are the rate increase and the SONGS settlement allows us to transfer some of the over-collections to that under-collection.
And another critical piece is our decommissioning decision because we had dollars that were spent for decommissioning but once we get approval to get access to the decommissioning trust we’ll transfer those dollars over to the ERA under-collection.
And hopefully by year-end we’ll be in good shape.
And obviously the thing that’s going to change that up or down is what happens with gas prices.
And based on the forecasts we used for 2015 I know for a fact that we’re probably under-running the actual expenditures because we used a higher forecast than gas prices are right now.
So to simplify that $1.2 billion or so should convert to cash over the next 12 months cash that improves the balance sheet of SoCal Ed.
How do you think about utilizing that cash? Well some of it’s just moving from one side of the pocket to the other because we had the dollars sitting and then we just transferred over as part of the SONGS settlement.
And some of it we have commercial paper borrowings to support the under-collections.
And those will go to [unintelligible] those short term borrowings.
Net-net-net we probably won’t have much in the way of excess cash.
We’ll have excess equity as we talked about from the SONGS regulatory asset financing.
But most of the cash is going to be used to pay off other things that are maybe outstanding or help to fund capital expenditures going on in the utility.
Last thing when you look at the holding company level debt both short term and long term it looks like it’s up a bit year over year kind of in the 2013 into 2014.
Can you talk about what your goal is in terms of how much both short term and long term debt you want to carry at the holdco level? Yeah that’s a good question.
We have outstanding a $400 million note that comes due I think in 2017 if I’m not mistaken.
And we’re considering what to do with that now.
We added additional commercial paper borrowings and obviously note payables to the EME creditors.
The total obligation was $600 million.
We paid $200 million.
We’ve got two more payments of $200 million in September this year and September of next year for $400 million.
And the whole source of repayment for the majority of the borrowings we have outstanding today really will be from the monetization of the EME tax benefits.
I said in my script we’ve got $1.1 billion of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards and if we don’t get an extension of bonus depreciation in 2015 likely SCE will be fully taxable as it runs off its NOLs and it will be then paying taxes to the federal government.
Bonus doesn’t apply to state government State of California so we’re obviously paying taxes for the state.
And then we’ll start rapidly amortizing EME benefits.
One of the wildcards here we’ll have to consider and Ted mentioned in his comments if we do get resolution of the SONGS litigation with MHI we would look to take an abandonment loss in the year that’s resolved.
We have to file a private letter ruling and we’ll take a writeoff.
And so that could affect the full timing of the monetization of the tax benefits but I think it’s going to take it out to 2017 possibly in early 2018 and fully amortize off the $1.1 billion of EME tax benefits.
Your next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
I was wondering about the operating costs savings here.
How much of that is in the 2015 to 2017 GRC? To the extent that you guys got more operating cost savings than perhaps were in the GRC request is there any potential to go back and adjust that? Could regulators come back and say no we need to adjust your operating cost forecasts? Or are we signed sealed and delivered here and just waiting for the commission? So the full case is before the commission.
The hearings occurred in January and so it’s off to the ALJs to draft a proposed decision.
Included in the case were some O&amp;M savings that we identified as we were preparing the case and we’re proposing that we would share 50% of those potential savings.
And beyond that I can’t comment.
I don’t know what the commission’s going to do or what the ALJs may propose and we’ll just have to see how it ultimately unfolds.
But one point I just want to emphasize we will continue to look for cost savings to try to improve our efficiencies.
So there is a chance the regulators could come back and talk about the request but not necessarily likely.
We’ll just have to see what they come back with.
We won’t know until we get a proposed decision.
The next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Just a separate follow up question.
Ted maybe you could just give us a little bit of color of you know we see all the headlines on PG&amp;E and ex parte issues and then you made one potential ex parte filing.
Just how much is this impacting the ability to function on the normal things that you have to get done at the commission including getting the GRC done? And also just how should we think about the risk of you potentially having additional ex parte filings? In terms of affecting the business I would say it doesn’t really have a significant effect on the business.
This is a fairly arcane area but I would just say generally speaking the ex parte rules particularly on matters like the San Onofre matter the OII that’s really designed to provide equal access to all parties to the proceeding with equal time.
So I think one of the misconceptions in something like SONGS OII is that you’re precluded from having conversations.
You’re not.
It’s just the rules are designed to make sure that if we have conversations with decision makers that those are noticed that we include in there how much time we spent with which decision maker so that all the other parties have the equal access equal amount of time.
That’s the whole concept behind it.
So I don’t see any of this as hurting the ability to do business.
It’s complicated and cumbersome and sometimes kind of difficult on the interpretation of some of the specific provisions but fundamentally when we have proceedings before the commission we follow the rules we go about doing the business the way it’s really set up to do it.
There’s plenty of opportunity in all of those proceedings for all parties to be heard.
That’s kind of the point of having these things before the commission.
So I don’t see any big element there.
And I got so warmed up on that part of the question I forgot the second part of your question.
I guess just the impact on getting your GRC done.
More just because the commission is so in the spotlight and dealing with this.
I don’t see it.
I mean I’ll choose my words a little carefully here.
We are pretty soon going to be in the third month of 2015 the GRC was supposed to be completed at the end of last year.
Just like three years ago we’re already now well into the next year.
That makes it a little more complicated to run the business but I don’t see that as being the result of ex parte stuff or any of that.
That’s just the process of getting through a very complicated proceeding like a GRC.
So I would say generally I don’t see it having any big impact.
The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Real quick there’s both a lawsuit proceeding as well as a re-hearing request to unwind the SONGS OII settlement.
Can you just talk about the process for both of those and kind of what the complainants are seeking or what their grounds are? Let me introduce Adam Umanoff.
He is our EIX general counsel.
He joined us in January.
We’re happy to have him.
So Adam could you pick up that question? Sure Jim.
Happy to do so.
Good afternoon.
You asked about the application for re-hearing and a federal lawsuit.
I’ll take them one at a time.
An application for re-hearing was filed by the Coalition to Decommission San Onofre and that was filed in the end of last year mid-December 2014.
They’re basically asking for the California Public Utility Commission to reconsider their decision approving the SONGS settlement.
And the basis for their request is a bunch of alleged procedural irregularities in the proceeding undertaken by the CPUC.
It’s our view that there really is no legitimate basis for the CPUC to overturn the settlement based upon the theories advanced by the Coalition to Decommission San Onofre but of course that’s for the CPUC to decide.
All the parties to the SONGS settlement have filed a joint response in early January rejecting the request for a re-hearing.
The CPUC does not operate under a firm deadline to respond but they normally respond within three to five months so we should expect to hear from the CPUC by the middle of March to the middle of May.
Separately another plaintiff Citizen’s Oversight who happens to be represented by the same lawyer who represents the Coalition to Decommission San Onofre filed a federal court action down in San Diego and basically raised some constitutional theories that the SONGS settlement was an impermissible taking of rate payer property.
That suit was filed in November of 2014.
Both we and the CPUC filed motions to dismiss at the end of January.
There will be some further paperwork back and forth as the plaintiff replies and we again reply in February and March.
And if all goes well we expect a decision from the federal court in April of 2015.
So in a couple of months.
That was the last question.
I will now turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone for participating and if you have any follow up questions you know where to find us.
Thanks very much and have a good evening.
Good afternoon and welcome to the Edison International first quarter 2015 financial teleconference.
My name is Angie and I'll be your operator today.
[Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin.
Thanks Angie and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also here are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com.
Also starting this quarter we have posted Ted's and Jim's prepared remarks on the website and filed it in 8-K so that you can follow their comments.
Later this week we will distribute our regular business update presentation for use in upcoming investor meeting.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
Please read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
During Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
I'll now turn the call over to Ted.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Our first quarter core earnings were $0.90 per share unchanged from the first quarter of the previous year.
Because SCE has not received a decision in its 2015 General Rate Case comparisons of results are not particularly meaningful.
Jim Scilacci will cover the specifics.
I'm certain that what is on your minds now more than anything else is the filing we will make tomorrow with the California Public Utilities Commission regarding communications with CPUC decision-makers during the SONGS settlement process.
Although we are still finalizing our response I want to make some comments about what we expect to file.
Since our work on the filing is still on going there is some small risk that I will have to supplement what I say today but it is outweighed by our desire to be transparent.
First we do not expect to file any additional late ex parte notices.
We conducted a thorough process to identify and review communications and internal documents concerning the settlement of the SONGS OII between CPUC decision-makers and personnel at SCE and EIX who could reasonably be expected to have engaged in such communications.
As specified in the ALJs' order we looked at documents from the period between March 1 2013 a few weeks before the Warsaw meeting and November 30 2014 a short while after the settlement was approved by the PUC.
This is a mammoth undertaking involving an initial broad pool of slightly more than 2 million emails and documents and then winnowing that group down in successive levels of review to isolate documents relating to the SONGS OII and the settlement process.
I've come to learn how these types of document searches and reviews are done.
It is very complicated.
It requires real care in setting up the parameters for searching and sifting given the huge number of documents that could potentially be relevant.
It also involves some judgments about search parameters.
We used multiple levels of review and a lot of checking and rechecking of work.
We used an outside law firm to conduct this work.
All of this was done in a sincere attempt to do a thorough complete and proper job.
We believe we have done so.
Our filing tomorrow will provide details on the search criteria and the multi-layered review and checking process used.
This work will result in us providing a couple dozen emails in our response to the CPUC.
As I said we do not expect to make any additional late ex parte notices.
That said we are providing in our response quite a bit of additional information in an effort to be transparent and forthcoming on contacts between CPUC decision-makers and SCE and EIX executives on SONGS related matters.
I want to highlight some of the additional information we intend to provide.
We are providing a chronology of key events relating to the SONGS settlement covering the period from the initiation of the OII to the commission approval of the settlement.
We are also providing a summary and the relevant documents where we had communications with CPUC decision-makers even though those communications fell outside of the criteria for filing ex parte notices.
These cover things like: a courtesy call to a commissioner to give him or her a heads-up we are about to issue a press release on a SONGS related matter; or a commissioner initiated contact which was a one-way conversation from them to one of our executives with no substantive response by our executive that is our executive was essentially in listen-only mode; or communications between a CPUC decision-maker and SCE or EIX personnel on procedural matters; or updates provided to CPUC commissioners on the status of SONGS restart and system reliability efforts.
This effort has also highlighted for me the need to have Rule 8.4 which covers ex parte notices reviewed and clarified.
Any rule can't possibly cover every conceivable communication circumstance which creates a need to interpret that rule.
Over time the parties who regularly practice before the CPUC commissioners utilities and interveners alike and resulting commission decisions develop a body of accepted practice concerning that rule.
We make every effort to comply with Rule 8.4 on ex parte notices.
In my opinion Rule 8.4 could certainly stand to be clarified and updated.
We are the ones who bear the reputational and financial risk of interpretations of and after the fact judgments regarding an ambiguous rule.
We understand President Picker intends to review Rule 8.4.
We very much welcome such an effort.
Our response also contains as required by the ALJs' order a privilege log of the documents withheld based on legal privilege.
Finally our response will contain declarations from Steve Pickett and Ron Litzinger.
These documents primarily provide additional information surrounding the meeting former President Peevey requested in Warsaw.
Again we are going this extra step in an attempt to provide all parties and the public with transparency about this contact.
I want to make one final point on this matter.
Some have contended that the settlement was influenced by the Peevey/Pickett Warsaw meeting.
While I can certainly understand the motivation for some to make this statement it just doesn't stand up to basic logic.
To start with the Warsaw contact was made a good two-and-a-half months before we had even made the decision to permanently shutdown SONGS.
Negotiations with TURN and ORA commenced after shutdown and proceeded with both sides writing on a clean slate so to speak.
The settlement negotiations lasted over 10 months with 14 face-to-face meetings among the negotiating parties and numerous phone calls.
SCE did not negotiate any settlement with Peevey nor did ORA or TURN.
Peevey may have had his own ideas about what a settlement should contain but he wasn't involved in the negotiations.
Any settlement was going to have to address the same four basic cost items at issue whether articulated by Peevey or anyone else.
Those four were: the cost of the replacement steam generators how the non-RSG assets were going to be recovered replacement power and O&amp;M expenses.
There was also the matter of how any third-party recoveries from insurance and MHI would be treated.
Identifying the areas to negotiate was easy the hard part was coming to agreement on how they were to be handled and everybody had different ideas about that.
ORA and TURN were active fully-engaged parties to the settlement negotiations.
They reached their own conclusions as to the gives and takes in the negotiations and ultimately as to the settlement as a whole and the value it would provide to customers.
Importantly the result of the negotiations was materially different from the general framework laid out by President Peevey in Warsaw.
TURN and ORA in their April 17 press releases provided their views of the material differences between the settlement and the Peevey construct and maintained ratepayers fared considerably better under the settlement.
Just yesterday the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility provided a different analysis that came to the opposite point of view but still concludes that the settlement was materially different from the Peevey construct.
All of this proves the point comparing the final settlement to Peevey's generalized framework from Warsaw is bound to produce this type of debate given the lack of detail in that suggested framework.
This vagueness lends itself to differing interpretations really guesses as to what he may have had in mind.
What is most important here is that Peevey's contact with us and any subsequent contacts did not have any influence on the parties who are actually involved in the settlement negotiations.
As I said our current plan is to file our response to the ALJs' order tomorrow.
Hopefully my comments provide some helpful context for that filing.
I am sure you will understand that we will probably decline to say anything more about this matter in the Q&amp;A session on this call and until after we've made our filing.
I now want to turn to some of our other business priorities.
Of course a major item for us this year is reaching a reasonable outcome on SCE's General Rate Case.
We don't really have anything material to report on that effort today.
Beyond the GRC our priorities for the business remain safety operational excellence and investing and modernizing the electric system to enhance reliability better serve our customers and support public policy.
I'll touch on these briefly.
Safety leads the list of operational excellence priorities for us.
When we say safety we mean both public safety and worker safety.
In both cases it requires us to constantly find new ways to keep the public and ourselves aware and focused on potential safety hazards and to invest in ways to eliminate or mitigate safety risks.
Actually some of this circles back to provisions in our GRC request too.
Although we have continued to improve our safety performance in recent years we can do more based on the best-in-class utilities and performance in other industries.
A robust safety culture is a top priority.
Our other operational excellence priorities are reliability customer service and affordability.
Sustained productivity improvement must be part of our DNA.
We have made substantial progress on this over the last several years but we want to continue to improve.
One important measure is customer rates.
We have mentioned to you before that our goal the last few years has been to keep the increase in our system average rate to 3% to 5% per annum.
We seek to do this even in the face of cost pressures from expensive mandates that require substantial incremental investment.
Over the last five years we have managed to stay at the bottom-end of that targeted range which actually compares favorably with our peers in California and several others around the country.
We would like to continue to push that down to the level of inflation or lower.
Today's electric system provides customers with reliable and affordable electric energy but the system needs to be upgraded to meet changing customer needs.
Residential and business customer needs are evolving while policymakers want us to provide an electric system that facilitates a low-carbon economy.
To meet these needs we need to be able to integrate more distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar energy storage and electric transportation charging.
The Distribution Resource Plan and related filings we will make this summer to the CPUC will serve as the road map for modernizing the electric distribution system.
The long-term need to invest in a reliable and technologically advanced grid puts a premium on mitigating the potential rate impact of those necessary investments by doing all we can to manage our costs while operating more effectively in meeting customer needs.
This is critical for our long-term competitiveness.
Beyond our utility business we continue to pursue growth opportunities in competitive businesses across the electric power industry.
Doing so allows us to serve customers outside of SCE's territory.
We are focused on providing energy services to commercial and industrial customers through Edison Energy as well as competitive transmission outside SCE's service area through Edison Transmission.
Frankly I have never felt better about how our company is positioned for the future both in terms of our strategy and the people we have in place to execute it.
Our customers' needs and our industry will continue to evolve.
I believe Edison is particularly well-positioned to be at the forefront of these changes.
With that I will now turn it over to Jim Scilacci for the financial update.
Thanks Ted.
Good afternoon everyone.
I'll cover the following topic in my remarks.
First quarter result our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans.
I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings because SCE is yet to receive a General Rate Case decision.
The utility is recording revenues largely based on 2014 authorized levels.
In the quarter SCE receives a final GRC decision we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1 2015.
As Ted mentioned earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full year 2015 earnings.
In the meantime we believe the simplified rate base model is the best starting point to model full year earnings.
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation.
As Ted said core earnings are unchanged year-over-year at $0.90 per share.
GAAP or basic earnings per share are $0.38 per share higher.
This is primarily due to non-core items last year related to the SONGS OII settlement of $0.29 per share and $0.07 per share related to EME.
This quarter we also had $0.02 per share of income under the HLBV accounting treatment for solar tax equity financings.
As explained in our last call Edison Energy has tax equity investors.
We are required to allocate income under the hypothetical liquidation at book value accounting method.
Since this income does not relate to project performance we classified it as non-core.
Edison Energy is included in EIX parent and other results.
Edison International parent company costs are flat at $0.03 per share with slightly higher corporate expenses are offset by earnings from Edison Mission Group as we continue to monetize Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio.
With respect to our quarterly results let me clarify the presentation of two items in our results.
First as I previously mentioned we are recording CPUC revenues at 2014 authorized level pending a General Rate Case decision.
We used this approach except for one modification.
We deferred $36 million of authorized revenues or $0.07 per share allocated to the first quarter related to incremental repair deductions pending the outcome of the GRC.
There is an offsetting $0.07 per share of income tax benefits shown separately on the slide.
Since we don't know how the general rate case will treat repair deductions we decided it was prudent not to recognize these benefits.
The $0.07 is above repair deductions that are included in the 2015 GRC filing.
Second let me clarify the presentation of SONGS which is addressed in footnote 4 to this slide.
During the first quarter of 2015 we began to amortize the SONGS regulatory asset and recorded property taxes which are recovered through revenues.
During the first quarter of last year we had O&amp;M costs and property taxes that were recovered through GRC revenues.
Neither of these affected net income so we have excluded them from earnings drivers.
A fuller description of these items is included in our 10-Q.
Let me also note that beginning January 1 2015 SONGS costs are classified as decommissioning expense and recorded as a reduction in our asset retirement obligations.
Turning back to our slide.
We did benefit from $0.07 per share of higher FERC revenues primarily related to rate base growth and recovery of higher operating costs.
Looking at costs O&amp;M is $0.01 per share higher.
Depreciation and amortization costs are $0.04 per share higher from an increase in transmission and distribution investments.
Net financing cost benefited by $0.02 per share largely from higher AFUDC equity income.
This reflects a higher AFUDC rate and a slightly higher construction work in progress balance.
After adjusting for the incremental repair deductions SCE had lower tax benefits of $0.04 per share.
The lower tax benefits relate principally to higher flow-through tax benefits related to higher repair deductions last year.
Although our results are better than most analyst estimates I suspect this is largely due to difficulty in estimating quarterly profile of revenues and earnings from our 2014 authorized revenue requirement.
Other than perhaps a favorable AFUDC equity earnings trend which could remain a factor for the rest of the year first quarter results are largely consistent with this simplified rate base model we encourage investors to use as a starting point.
Please turn to Page 3.
We have revised our three-year forecast reflecting the removal of the Coolwater-Lugo transmission project.
This 220 kV project planned in San Bernardino County was intended to support additional utility-scale renewable projects and overall grid reliability.
In mid-March the California Independent System Operator determined that this project is not necessary to provide full capacity deliverability but would conduct additional studies to assess potential need for all or portions of the project for future system requirements.
In the interim the CAISO requested that the CPUC suspend its approval to proceed with the project.
SCE supports the suspension given the changing circumstances.
Last week the CPUC issued a proposed decision that recommends dismissing the Coolwater-Lugo application on the basis that sufficient deliverability now exists.
The Coolwater-Lugo project was forecasted to cost $740 million of which the most recent forecast had $584 million of expenditures falling within the 2015 through 2017 forecast period.
Partially offsetting this are costs and timing updates for a number of other smaller FERC projects.
The net result is a decrease of approximately $300 million in FERC CapEx in our capital spending forecast.
For your information we have provided the prior forecast at the bottom of the slide.
Lastly SCE has FERC pre-approval for prudently incurred abandoned plant costs.
We will continue to finance SCE's growth consistent with our authorized capital structure.
Periodically SCE will issue long-term debt and preferred stock to support its growing rate base.
Of course retained earnings will provide common equity needs.
SCE's 13-month weighted average common equity component was 48.4%.
With the cash flow benefits from bonus depreciation expected to commence later this year SCE may have only modest additional financing requirements this year.
Please turn to Page 4.
Our rate base growth forecast remains 7% to 9% compounded annually during the forecast period.
The FERC capital spending changes have a minor impact on the average rate base forecasts for each year.
And SCE continues to have a number of growth programs such as storage electric vehicle charging and the grid of the future projects that will remain important sources of growth well into the next decade.
Please turn to Page 5.
We have included in this slide some of the important 2015 earnings considerations that we introduced on our last call.
The only change is a minor revision to the 2015 rate base forecast that I have discussed earlier.
To reiterate our prior statements we don't plan on issuing 2015 guidance until after SCE receives a General Rate Case decision.
I'll finish with a couple of reminders on Edison International's investment thesis.
Please turn to Page 6.
First we continue to emphasize a lower-risk SCE investment program focused on the wires business both for reliability spending and for adapting the grid to the new technologies and needs that we've spoken about for some time.
To meet these investment requirements while keeping rate increases moderate we'll require sustained SCE productivity improvements.
Our base financing case remains no common equity issuance to support SCE's investment program.
Finally we continue to see the opportunity for above-average dividend growth potential to complement SCE's earnings growth.
Of course our plan is to increase the dividend back to our target payout ratio in steps over time.
Thanks.
Operator let's get started with Q&amp;A.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse.
I'll pass on the SONGS questions as there's a lot of folks asked those questions.
But I wanted to first ask with the July filing on kind of the distribution network of the future what else should we expect in that filing? And prospectively how quickly could that start to flow through your CapEx program and into rate as you guys devise that plan right now? We're still working through that.
The plan is to have a rather comprehensive filing on May 1 and we're hoping to include some potential investment parameters in terms of scale potentially.
And we're trying to figure out how ultimately to work that into our capital plans.
Now as you remember we have a general rate case coming up in 2018.
And as the way it works we have to file for that '18 rate case next year in late '16 and we're still working through it.
So we haven't made a final decision.
It will certainly be included we would think now in '18 general rate case that we'll see at the end of next year.
So I'll pause here and look to Pedro or Maria to see if they want to add anything more.
No.
I think you covered it well Jim.
Dan the PUC has specified a number of areas they want to see in the filings so actually working through all of that.
But your question is more about what are the impact in terms of capital spend and we'll address that there but largely the rate case is in the future.
We should clarify.
The filing is not May 1.
It's dated July 1.
And then I guess just one another question just specific to the quarter.
There is a lot of O&amp;M savings year-on-year this year versus last.
I know you guys are trying to hold up earnings until the GRC gets resolved.
But how does that rebalance this year? Will you guys have a big catch up in O&amp;M toward the backend of this year or is this going to be banged for this year and you kind of get on a normal cycle or more normal cycle next year? I think the safest thing to say until you can get a general rate case decision after that we'll be able to figure out what's normal.
Until then we're just speculating.
Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.
Can you just tell us after you make your filing tomorrow what the expected procedural schedule is going to look like at the commission? And do you expect that you'll still be able to get a final decision by May 30? It can be current open proceeding or it's already been delayed once so is there a chance given just the amount of the documents that you're giving to them and the limited amount of time between now and May 30 that we'll see another delay in that final decision date? So Greg this is Jim.
We'll have Adam Umanoff answer that question for you.
Adam is our General Counsel.
It's difficult to really answer that question.
We really can't speculate how quickly the CPUC will move to consider what we file and reach a final decision.
They certainly extended the deadline to the end of May to give them additional time to consider just this filing.
We're hopeful that it will be wrapped in that timeframe but we can't be sure.
After you file is there a comment period where we will see responses from different parties to the case or do you file the documents and then next step will be some sort of pronouncement by the commission? Again I'm speculating but I would suspect to see folks file additional comments based upon what we've produced.
Question on a completely different subject.
On the Coolwater-Lugo CapEx coming out and you guys have indicated for some time and I think this is sort of wrapped up into this filing coming on the grid of the future that you see a very long runway of necessary capital expenditures at or around or even potentially above the current sort of $4 billion plus-or-minus a year that you're spending because the deferral or potential cancellation of the Coolwater-Lugo line just sort of opened up an opportunity for you to move other spending that's necessary forward.
And if so at what point would you reassess that or when will we get an update or should we just assume over the next three-year period that that CapEx is out and we should do the rate base math based on the current guidance? I think my general impression was we already saw a little bit of a shifting that was going on with the adjustment because there was almost $600 million that came out of the forecast period and the net was $300 million.
That's the normal course that will occur.
And we've got some other things in the works as obviously the electric vehicle charging application in is processing its way through the PUC.
There is some storage opportunities.
And the grid of the future likely could be outside this period the '15 through '17 period but we're still working through that.
So I think we will stay consistent with what we previously said before that the capital expenditures are going to be in that $4 billion-ish range for the foreseeable future.
And it will be probably later next year before we can give you some additional visibility because that's when ultimately the GRC filing will go in and that will cover '18 '19 and '20.
Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Just real quick question thinking about bonus depreciation Jim you made a comment about it.
Just curious can you refresh us what's in your expectation for bonus DNA in 2015? And is that already flowing through rate basis part of the ongoing rate case? It is.
We've revised our general rate case showing earlier in the year in the update proceeding so that incorporate in our current numbers.
And the reason why we referred to it that we see that impact later in the year is that we file our tax return in the September timeframe and the cash flow benefit starts flowing through from that.
One other just a little bit of a follow-up.
If we see kind of any further downward changes in terms of capital spending does this have a corresponding impact potentially on the pace of change you and the Board might make in terms of dividend growth? I think I alluded to in my last statement from Greg's question that I don't really see a change in the level of capital expenditures going forward.
And so that would be consistent with our current plans to step up our dividend in steps over time get back to our targeted payout ratio.
So I don't really see a change Michael.
Julien Dumoulin from UBS.
So I wanted to ask you a quick question here on rate base trajectory right.
So I appreciate that it's still early days.
You've talked about the filing prospectively.
You talk about sort of backfilling the CapEx.
How do you feel about the current range below the low and high-end of the 7% and 9% beyond the current forecast period? I mean would it be appropriate to say that you're setting up to be in that range while not formally committing yourself to that? Well just the math of it if we're staying in that $4 billion trajectory the compound annual growth rate mathematically would slightly adjust over time downward.
It's just the math.
But I can't tell you how much and how we're going to fill it in it really will depend upon how the capital expenditures workout and will be filed with the commission later next year.
And then a clarification to a prior question.
So in terms of cost savings in the current quarter I know it's challenging and so maybe if you look last year there was about $0.23 give or take.
Is there any good way to kind of frame the current period vis-à-vis the cost savings and magnitude that we could see sort of maintained? That's a tough one.
And not that I wanted to duck the question until we get a general rate case decision it's really hard to say.
And we had embedded in our general rate case some assumptions regarding cost savings that we voluntary passed along to the customers.
And we will continue to look for additional cost savings but we'll have to wait for general rate case decision before we really know.
And ducking that one perhaps if I may.
In terms of M&amp;A and strategically position of the company how do think about sort of opportunities in California? And specifically thinking about the company outside of California you mentioned competitive transmission but in terms of getting a bigger footprint down the line or is that in the thought process at all? I'm going to give you a wholly unsatisfying answer because my lawyers will kick me hard if I say anything other than we don't comment on M&amp;A matters.
Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Jim you mentioned the higher AFUDC rate going on this year.
Could you just talk more about what's causing the higher AFUDC rate? Is that something that will continue on beyond 2015? Well it's hard to speculate beyond.
But remember we did the regulatory asset financing earlier in the year bringing cash in and which has the effect of reducing the amount of short-term borrowings we might carry which tend to reduce the AFUDC rate.
And I also mentioned that the flip balance was slightly higher so it's a combination of a higher rate and a slightly higher balance that led to the overall slightly higher AFUDC equity earnings.
If it's going to continue I just can't speculate on that now.
It's going to be so variable in terms of what happens to the general rate case what level of capital expenditures is ultimately authorized by the commission and so forth.
So I just can't speculate it at this point in time.
And then just on the GRC.
Is there any way to get a sense of timing on when we might get ALJ on that? I'd love to tell you but we just don't know sorry.
Ali Agha from the SunTrust.
Jim wanted to clarify as you had mentioned the best way to think about 2015 is earnings driver is really looking at the rate base model.
And also on a full year basis whenever you think about that given all the extra tax benefits and another incremental savings beyond authorized ROEs that you were getting in '14 the sense is you're starting off from a lower earnings base or will have a lower earnings base in '15 versus '14 and grow from there.
So with that as a backdrop can you explain to me maybe I've missed this why we're ending out with the flat earnings comparison in the first quarter if we are sticking to general rate base model? There is a lot of pushes and takes are going here and it really has to do with how they authorize '14.
And until you really have a general rate case decision I think what I was trying to imply earlier on my comments it's just very very hard to compare '14 to '15 given the situation we've got now.
So I will just like to say that let's just wait until we get a general rate case decision.
And we'll sort through it and give you a better indication of what's the potential power once the commission gives us a final decision.
And then secondly just to clarify the point on the process as far as SONGS is concerned is it fair to say that the rehearing forum is really the forum where ultimately this whatever final decision comes out it comes out from there.
The reason I ask that is one of the parties I don't know which TURN or ORAs asking for some additional fines to be incurred.
Is that all part of this rehearing proceeding or are there multiple or other proceedings we need to be aware of as well.
The proceeding that is active is the request for rehearing that's before the California Public Utility Commission.
There were as I think you know a Federal Court lawsuit brought by one of the opponents that was in District Court.
It was recently dismissed by the District Court so the action right now is before the California Public Utility Commission.
Once the decision is rendered by the California Public Utility Commission of course an opponent who might be dissatisfied with the decision can appeal to the courts.
But none of that activity is currently pending.
Just to clarify that I am sorry so any party that's asking for additional fines based on the email disclosures et cetera that is all part of this rehearing proceeding? It's a part of the rehearing proceeding and related filings.
For example two example two days ago the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility filed an additional petition for modification in this docket in the SONGS OII docket but that along with the current request for rehearing we would expect those all to be disposed off roughly at the same time by the California Public Utility Commission.
Travis Miller from Morningstar.
Just wondering when we're thinking about California specifically how do you think about the investments through Edison Energy and SCE when we're thinking about these new technologies new age grid technologies.
How you think about allocating capital to opportunities through SCE or through Edison Energy in California? I think primarily within the utility we see that's where the principle opportunity to invest in the distribution system resides.
And that's where we see quite a bit of modernization and expansion of the distribution system taking place.
So I would expect the bulk of the investment would primarily take place at SCE.
At Edison Energy or on the competitive side so whether that's Edison Transmission or some of the CNI Energy Services or some of the other areas that we're looking at that's really opportunistic and its based on the standard parameters that we've used over the years for investment on the competitive side.
If we see something that gives us a positive rate of return after considering cost of capital and risk then we would seek to invest in those things so long as it stays in the basic electric footprint that we have.
So I think you should expect most of the capital would be dedicated to the SCE activities.
Public policy makers in California are certainly keen to see the utilities facilitate.
The policy objectives are moving to a low carbon economy.
That requires modernizing the system and allowing it to facilitate a number of the new technologies and that's where the bulk of the effort will probably be over the next few years.
And do you think if you got approval to invest those money at SCE and you take away the filing here this summer.
Could you carry lessons learned so to speak from SCE investments there storage EV et cetera to Edison Energy investments outside of California? Is that a potential business model thinking that you could take lessons learned or would think about Edison Energy as completely separate type of investments? This will be a fairly complicated answer.
I would say broadly strategically most definitely Edison International is in the electricity business and we look for opportunities not just in SCE's territory but throughout.
I think a lot of the changes that we see taking see place in the electric industry are in fact often occurring here in California.
So there is definitely I'll say a general strategic leaning opportunity that comes from that.
We have to be careful on some of the specifics there though.
Remember a lot of the investments that are being made in SCE are being funded by customer rates customer payments and we always have to be extremely careful about any bleed over a specific information or assets or value from the utility to the unregulated side.
All of that is captured underneath our affiliate rules but so long as we're really careful and cognizant on that I'd say your broader point if you will the strategic learning point is a valid one and one that we are actively trying to look for other opportunities outside of California.
Ashar Khan from Visium.
My questions have been asked.
The only one I have Jim is this $0.07 that you said that you deferred.
Is that $0.07 something which is on an annualized basis or a quarterly basis? I was just trying to get a little bit better understanding of that $0.07? That was $0.07 in the quarter Ashar.
So can we analyze that number? I don't know because really ultimately it depends on what the GRC decision ultimately turns out.
So I think it would be dangerous to try to analyze it until we get a full decision out here.
John Alli from Castleton Investment Management.
Ashar actually asked my questions I'll just follow-up offline.
I'm showing no further questions.
At this time I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Cunningham.
End of Q&amp;A Thanks everyone for participating today.
And don't hesitate to call up if you have any follow-up questions.
Thanks very much.
Good evening.
Thank you.
That does conclude today's conference.
Thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect from the audio portion.
Welcome to the Edison International Second Quarter 2015 Financial Teleconference.
My name is Jaclyn and I will be your operator for today.
[Operator Instructions].
I would now like to turn today's call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks Jaclyn and good afternoon everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also here are other members of the management team.
The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.Edisoninvestor.com.
Consistent with last quarter we posted Ted's and Jim's prepared remarks so that you can follow their comments.
Tomorrow afternoon we will distribute our regular business of the presentation for use in upcoming investor meetings.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
Please read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measures.
During Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
I will now turn the call over to Ted.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Second quarter earnings were $1.16 per share up $0.08 per share from last year.
However until SCE receives a decision on its 2015 general rate case comparisons of year-over-year results will not be that meaningful.
Jim will have the details in his comments.
Today I will touch on several policy and growth topics but first a comment on a comment on SONGS.
We were disappointed about the renewed uncertainty surrounding the SONGS settlement.
Most of the recent procedural moves and various motions have come from individuals and organizations that have consistently opposed the settlement since it was first announced over a year ago.
It was more troubling to have one of the six signatories of the settlement The Utility Reform Network advise the CPUC in late June that it no longer supported the settlement.
Interestingly in TURN's announcement it about which acknowledged that the terms of the settlement were good for customers and that the outcome of any litigated reconsideration process may not differ substantially from the terms of the settlement.
TURN is an important voice on consumer matters before the CPUC so we must hope that its failure to adhere to its obligations under the SONGS settlement represents an aberration.
We have now responded to all requests for information from the CPUC's administrative law judges regarding the challenges to the SONGS settlement.
We're hopeful they will rule on the outstanding issues soon.
Prolonging this period of uncertainty is not good for anyone.
We continue to believe strongly that the settlement met all of the required standards for last November's unanimous commission approval.
We believe that the SONGS settlement was the product of good faith arm's-length negotiations that resulted in a fair and reasonable outcome for our customers.
Let me turn to some regular toward policy developments.
The CPUC recently ruled on a residential rate design reform as required by Assembly Bill 327.
Their recent unanimous decision was the product of significant debates and compromise among the commissioners.
We didn't get everything we advocated for.
We would've liked to have seen more progress in increasing the proportion of revenues collected through fixed charges which would better match our actual cost of residential customers but the minimum bill will be raised from $1.80 to $10 a month.
Also we preserve the opportunity to revisit a more meaningful fixed charge in the future.
We achieved rate reform that places approximately 96% of our retail customers' kilowatt hours into a two-tiered rate section structure very similar to what we recommended.
About 4% of our retail customers' kilowatt hours will be subject to a surcharge for high usage.
The commissioners invested a tremendous amount of time and effort in this phase of the proceeding and we appreciated the unanimous agreement that getting residential rates closer to the true cost of service was an important tenant in producing fairness amongst customers.
Attention will now turn to the portion of the CPUC proceeding on net energy metering which relates to how customers who opt for rooftop solar are credited for their own generation.
Parties will be filing their net energy metering proposals next week.
Turning to a different subject we have received broad support for SCE's Charge Ready program.
This is the program we announced last October to invest infrastructure to support transportation electrification.
On July 9 a settlement with most of the parties was filed with the CPUC on the $22 million pilot phase of the program.
Importantly both TURN and the Office of Ratepayer Advocates are parties to the settlement as are environmental organizations and electric vehicle charger equipment companies.
The principal change to our original application in the settlement is to expense rather than capitalize the rebates that SCE would provide customers for the vehicle chargers installed.
While it didn't change the amount recommended for the pilot program we expect that if this provision is adopted for the full program the rate base opportunity will now be $225 million of the total $342 million estimate for the program.
We look forward to commission action on the pilot and subsequently on the full program.
The final topic I want to cover is SCE's distribution resources plan or DRP filed with the CPUC on July 1.
We consider this plan to be one of our most important filings this year and probably in several years.
We endeavored to not simply answer the commission's initial questions about integration of distributed energy resources but also to lay out our vision for how the grid of the future will facilitate customer choice of new technologies and support California's policies to move to a low-carbon economy.
The goal of the distribution resources plan is to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources at optimal locations within the distribution grid and to upgrade the distribution grid to better enable a plug-and-play approach for adding distributed energy resources and new technologies more broadly across our system.
These resources include distributed renewable generation such as rooftop and ground mount solar electric vehicle charging energy storage energy efficiency demand response.
California have used these resources as enablers in achieving its low-carbon objectives over the next several decades.
At the expected adoption rate for these distributed resources the electric grid will require substantial investment in modernization and upgrades.
As part of its filing SCE provided an initial view of the range of possible capital investments to achieve the goals of the DRP.
Assuming the CPUC support this provides some indication of our view of the investment required for the long-term program which will likely go well into the next decade.
Jim will talk about some of the financial details and how we see this working with the GRC process.
As I've just indicated significant capital investment will be required to modernize and upgrade SCE's distribution grid consistent with the DRP recommendations.
This is in addition to continued distribution system reliability investment anticipated electric vehicle charging and storage investments continued transmission and generation maintenance capital investment and potential improvements in capital spending productivity.
All of this is consistent with our lower risk wires-focused investment strategy.
Taken together we expect overall SCE capital spending to be at least $4 billion annually for the foreseeable future.
Depending on the state's preferences on the pace of adoption and on approval of DRP-related work in future general rate cases capital spending could be higher.
I will now turn it over to Jim for the financial update.
Thanks Ted.
This afternoon I will cover second quarter and year-to-date results and several other topics.
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation.
I will lead off my comments for the general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings.
Because SCE has yet to receive a 2015 general rate case decision the utility is recording revenues largely based upon 2014 authorized levels.
In the quarter SCE receives a final GRC decision we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1 2015.
Earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full-year 2015 earnings.
In the meantime we believe the simplified rate base approach is the best starting point to model full-year earnings.
As Ted said second quarter core earnings are $1.16 per share.
Consistent with our first-quarter approach we did defer revenues to offset incremental repair deductions pending the outcome of the 2015 GRC.
The amount of deferred revenue this quarter was $0.09 per share with the offsetting benefit in taxes.
You can see this in the summary of SCE's driver on this slide.
On a year-to-date basis SCE has now deferred your dollar $0.16 of revenue from incremental repair deductions because of the large delta between expected and forecast repair deductions for 2015 last May SCE made a filing with the CPUC to update its repair deductions for the 2015 through 2017 GRC period.
With the May filing SCE's updated 2015 revenue request would result in a $120 million revenue decrease from authorized revenues.
For the two post-test years the year-over-year revenue change would be an increase of $236 million and $320 million for the 2016 and 2017 respectively.
We have no insight as to the timing of the proposed GRC decision.
On July 24 SCE did respond to certain questions raised by the ALJ concerning they May filing regarding repair deductions.
The questions related to the coordination of ratemaking between CPUC and FERC.
The major items impacting second quarter results is a $0.31 per share tax benefit from reducing liabilities from uncertain tax positions.
During the quarter we received an IRS report for tax shares 2010 through 2012.
Based on this report we updated our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions which flow directly through to earnings.
We had a similar benefit of $0.09 last year related to updating uncertain tax positions for other tax benefit years.
Both of these are highlighted in the SCE key earnings drivers.
Historically we have classified the change in an estimate of an uncertain tax position both positive and negative as part of core earnings and highlight significant changes that affect period-over-period comparisons.
These items are not part of the simplified earnings model that we have discussed in the past and are subject to future revisions based on audits new information and other developments related to our tax positions.
Excluding the $0.31 share per share benefit second quarter core earnings are $0.85 per share with SCE contributing $0.87 offset by $0.02 loss at the EIX holding company.
In the core EPS drivers table we netted out SONGS related impact on revenues O&amp;M and depreciation.
On this basis revenues are lower by $0.03 per share due to the $0.09 per share deferred revenue I mentioned earlier and partially offset by a $0.06 per share benefit from higher FERC-related and other revenues.
Looking at costs O&amp;M has $0.01 per share positive variance which we continue our cost management focus.
SCE's second quarter results included $0.02 per share in severance costs this year and $0.01 per share last year.
On a year-over-year basis the difference is minimal because of rounding.
Depreciation expense increased by $0.06 per share reflecting SCE's ongoing wires investment.
SCE benefited by lower financing costs by $0.03 per share.
This relates primarily to higher AFUDC equity earnings.
Turning to taxes I've already discussed most of the major items.
These include the uncertain tax positions this year and last year as well as the $0.09 per share of incremental repair deductions that is the offset to the $0.09 of revenue so no net earnings impact.
The balance is lower tax benefits year over year of $0.12 per share mainly related to lower flow-through tax benefits than last year revisions to estimated liabilities of our net operating losses interest and state income taxes.
Remaining $0.07 per share negative variance includes benefit from last year that did not recur in 2015 such as generator settlements and a San Onofre property tax refund.
For the EIX holding company losses were $0.01 lower than last year due to lower corporate expenses and higher income from affordable housing projects.
We continue to wind down the Edison capital low-income housing portfolio.
Please turn to Page 3.
I don't plan to review the year to date result -- financial results in detail but the earnings analysis is consistent with the second quarter results.
As I have said previously comparisons pending a 2015 GRC decision are not meaningful.
Please turn to Page 4.
You will see that the uptick in interest rates is reflected in the trend of the Moody's Utility Bond Index shown at the green line.
The 12-month moving average line shown in blue is moving back towards the 5% base rate.
Given the short time period remaining on the 12-month measurement period it is likely that SCE's CPUC return on common equity will remain at 10.45% during 2016.
At FERC the moratorium on filing and ROE change expired on July 1.
I would also like to touch on a few other SCE-related financial matters that are not shown on the slide.
First SEC's weighted average equity component for regulatory purposes was 48.9% at June 30 compared to 48.4% at the end of the first quarter.
SCE is required to maintain a 48% common equity layer on a rolling 13-month basis.
Second SCE continues to make good progress on reducing its fuel and purchase power under collection.
As of June 30 of last year SCE's ERRA balancing account was under collected by $1.6 billion.
As of June 30 this year the ERRA under collection was $543 million.
The billion-dollar reduction was from three primary reasons SONGS settlement refund credits against the ERRA balancing account the 2014 ERRA rate increase and lower-than-expected power and natural gas prices.
As of July 23 commission conference the CPUC approved SCE's access to the SONGS 2 and 3 nuclear decommissioning trusts for costs incurred from the June 2013 plant shut down through the end of 2014.
These costs amounted $343 million and the amount will be refunded to customers via a credit to the ERRA under collections pursuant to the SONGS settlement.
This morning SCE file the settlement agreement and the 2015 ERRA proceeding.
As part of this settlement SCE has agreed to forgo any 2015 ERRA rate increase adjustment.
We now expect that the ERRA under collection will be fully recovered before year end.
Lastly earlier this month both SCE and EIX extended the terms of their respective credit agreement by a year to July 2020 for $2.6 billion at SCE and $1.18 billion at EIX.
The remainder $150 million for SCE and $68 million for EIX will mature in July 2019.
There are no material changes to the terms and conditions.
Please turn to Page 5.
SCE's capital spending forecast is unchanged from the first quarter.
Ted has already discussed the long-term growth opportunity around the distribution resources plan but I want to add a couple of financial specifics.
Please turn to Page 6.
SCE preliminarily estimated up to $560 million in potential DRP capital expenditures during the 2015 through 2017 forecast period.
These proposed expenditures are largely weighted towards 2017.
SCE has requested a memorandum account for the 2015 through 2017 revenue requirement of these investments to avoid any retroactive ratemaking issues.
DRP investment that are made within authorized levels for the 2015 through 2017 GRC period will not have any incremental earnings impact.
If our total investment exceeds the amount authorized due to the DRP spending and if a memorandum account is authorized then we will seek to recover associated revenue requirements as part of SCE's 2018 general rate case.
Please turn to Page 7.
The rate base forecast for the 2015 through 2017 GRC period is unchanged from the first quarter.
Please turn to Page 8.
This chart provides 2015 financial assumptions and has been updated for year-to-date results and amounts related to revenue recognition on repair deductions that I covered earlier.
Please turn to Page 9.
I would like to finish with a recap of our investment thesis.
The DRP filing and ongoing grid investments that Ted discussed strengthens the long-term growth thesis for SCE.
Future capital spending at the $4 billion level implies very roughly a $2 billion per-year increase in rate base.
We're planning to grow our dividend meaningfully as we move back to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings in steps over time.
Lastly we will prudently manage our capital structure and have no plans for external common equity.
Thank you and I will turn to call over to the operator to moderate the Q&amp;A.
[Operator Instructions].
Our first question comes from Michael Weinstein of UBS.
Your line is open.
It's Julien here.
I suppose first question out of the gate in terms of the GRC can you elaborate on the settlement opportunity? And also perhaps just in terms of the potential for a longer than a three-year resolution is there an opportunity for a fourth year? I guess it's very difficult for us to speculate on something like that and if there were settlement discussions we would not normally comment on that Julien so I will just have to if I can duck that question.
Three to four years -- we've only filed for three it makes it challenging to do a fourth unless you had some kind of special arrangement.
So as much as we would like to get these things done more quickly and get online and get them approved it would be a challenge to do something like that.
Got it.
But in terms of confidence in the timeline here perhaps if you can elaborate? As I said in my prepared remarks we just don't have a view.
We're waiting for a proposed decision and that's all we can say right now.
Fair enough.
And then perhaps just terms of the wider CapEx program obviously you provided it pretty meaningful update intra-quarter here.
How are you thinking in the long-term? Is there going to be eventually coming out of this process incremental CapEx? Should we ultimately be continuing to think about 4 to 4.5 throughout the process of having these proposals ultimately I suppose ratified or adopted or what have you? That's what we've been indicating.
We've said in fact it was in my remarks and probably in Ted's too that we see that 4 to 4.5 range being sustained based on all the things we're seeing now and with the DRP but again some of it is subject to a lot of commission approval.
Obviously that they are going to go through and review this and give us some indication as far as a time frame and so that's still a lot in their court in terms of how they work through it.
But our current view is somewhere in that $4 billion to $4.5 billion range.
And yes we did get the question come back through and it's from Hugh Wynne of Bernstein Research.
Your line is open.
I know you can't call the outcome but I was wondering if you might provide a little bit of clarity on the procedural steps that have to be taken by the commission to consider the potential reopening of the SONGS settlement and if so the steps that you would expect after that.
Hugh it's Jim.
We're going to have to Adam Umanoff our General Counsel provide some answers there.
Good afternoon Hugh.
As you know there is a potential petition for a modification from before the public utility commission.
We really can't give you any certainty on the timing of the commission's consideration of that petition.
Motions have been filed responses have been made.
There is no specific time period under which the commission is obligated to respond.
We're certainly hopeful as Ted mentioned that this will be resolved quickly but we can't give you any definitive timeline for that resolution.
There is a companion motion for sanctions before the public utility commission in connection with ex parte communications or allegations of improper ex parte communications.
We would hope that that would be resolved concurrently if not in advance of the consideration of the petition for modification.
And if the filing is -- the petition for modification is accepted and the San Onofre rate case is reopened can you give us any general feel as to what the process for litigation would be and the timeline for that? Again first and foremost we don't believe that the existing commission precedent would support reopening of the SONGS settlement.
But we certainly can't advise you with any certainty that it can't happen.
If the proceeding is reopened we would return to litigation and litigation of the San Onofre OII would likely take considerable period of time.
It would not happen in a matter of weeks or months.
Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Your line is open.
On SONGS can you give an update in terms of where you are in the process with NEIL? And also there were lots of headlines over the last couple of days about the arbitration with MHI.
Can you just give an update on that as well? Sure.
I would be happy to.
Hello Michael.
With respect to NEIL we continue to pursue recovery of our losses from NEIL but really can't speculate as to the timing of concluding that effort.
With respect to MHI I think it's important as a preface to remind everyone that we're subject to a confidentiality order from the arbitration panel who is hearing the MHI claims.
We're not in a position to comment on any of the substantive or procedural activity in the MHI arbitration.
I can tell you that we believe we're still on track for a spring 2016 hearing and I hope for resolution to that hearing and final order later in 2016.
Can I ask just a procedural question if any of the parties has issues with the final order that comes out of an ICC arbitration if they want to litigate can they? And if so where? Generally the arbitral order is expected to be final.
There are very limited grounds for appeal.
It remains to be seen if a frustrated party chose to appeal where they would take that.
Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Your line is open.
Could you may be spend a little time going through what the DRP process is from here and what the commission is actually going to decide on the DRP? Sure.
Steve this is Pedro Pizarro.
We filed -- we and the other utilities filed our plans on July 1.
From here the commission is going to go through a traditional process to review the filings and ultimately comment and approve on them.
As Jim mentioned in his comments in addition to the element that the PUC asked for in the filing they asked for things like an analysis of the capacity of our system to integrate distributed resources approach that we will follow to provide transparency to the market in terms of what the capacity is and how we will update it.
There was also a number of demonstration projects that we propose to do per the PUC order.
So they will plan on all of that and ultimately approve a final approach.
We also asked for the memorandum account treatment that Jim mentioned.
So at this point I don't think we can speculate on final timing but we would expect under a typical timeline -- this is a new process but in a typical PUC timeline we would expect approval sometime in the next year.
And is this a case where there is intervention and people can have their own view on your proposal? Is this something then where maybe there could be a chance to try and settle this case? How does this case proceed from that aspect? So it is a litigated proceeding so there will be opportunities for interveners to file comments and for different views to be aired at the PUC.
Really too early to comment on whether there is a prospect for settlement among parties or the like.
Okay.
And then just a question on the memo account treatment.
So you wouldn't keep seek recovery of the investment through 2017 until the GRC.
But under the memo account would you effectively be able to recover that investment on like a non-cash basis with a return in the meantime? That's a good question.
There's still some speculation in terms of how it actually operates.
The memorandum account as I said was really just to preserve the opportunity to recover the revenue requirement associated with the expenditure.
So you can go back and essentially attempt to justify the reasonableness of the expenditure.
Then through the general rate case in 2018 we would hope to seek recovery if in fact all the conditions were met.
I wouldn't expect -- I think you are trying to go for some additional earnings in the 2015 through 2017 time frame associated with it.
I think it's too early to project that we would in fact get anything.
I think it's going to be more weighted towards 2018 anyway.
And if you look at the charts that show the level of expenditure for the DRP it's heavily weighted toward 2017 anyway if the commission will allow us to spend that kind of dough.
Our next question comes from Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse.
Your line is open.
on the long-term CapEx discussion if you think about kind of the buckets -- the 2015 to 2017 period of CapEx soft phase-out of transmission more distribution and maintenance work.
If you think about that 2018 and on what CapEx is getting substituted out? So think about the changing mix of your capital how do you see it evolving as the DRP money comes in more significantly? Transmission we will have to see what happens ultimately with some of the legislation that is pending too.
We've been seeing that it's gone up as we have built the renewable lines.
Now it's been coming down as we're finishing Tehachapi and a few other renewable projects we've got in the pipeline.
We've been saying all along there's not much generation.
It's about $100 million of maintenance capital we have for the legacy generation fleet.
The rest -- we've been saying as transmissions come down we've been stepping up distribution because we're trying to get our replacement rates up to where they need to be so they support what we're trying to do from an overall reliability perspective.
So we're trying to balance us all within the $4 billion range and that's the goal.
That's what we're trying to work for and hopefully we can fit all of this in with the DRP accordingly.
So I'll look at Maria or Pedro -- anything else to add? Maybe what I would add Jim is think about one of the base spending areas is that infrastructure replacement for distribution system that will continue.
In the DRP filing we outlined a number of categories of DRP-related investments.
I would expect that as we go through future rate case cycles that line between what's called quote-unquote new DRP spending and what's core distribution spending will start to emerge as these technologies of the future really become part of the core mainstream of core distribution system.
One other piece there is that some of the DRP spending -- the grid reinforcement piece that we have outlined for both 2015 2017 and then beyond time frames some of that is accelerating work that might normally see as distribution infrastructure replacement.
It's hardening circuits that might be some of our lower voltage circuits that need to be brought up to more modern higher voltage circuit so they can accommodate greater number of distributed resources.
So that's again an area where we're taking investments that may have been part of a longer-term infrastructure replacement plan but because of the need to integrate distributed resources it needs to get accelerated forward in order to harden the grill and allow faster adoption of the new technology.
So again that's a place where you see that line over the years ahead blurring a little bit between infrastructure replacement and the DRP bucket.
And just on transmission with the Delaney line going away from your Group how do you guys think about the ability to win bigger transmission projects in California in the future? Is this going to become just a lowest-cost bid type of environment that makes it harder to get the most optimal project on? So you know the ISO is running their competitive process in the under FERC Order 1000.
We had did with partners in the Delaney-Colorado River process.
We expect that as other opportunities come up in our service area we will continue to bid on those and put out competitive proposals.
I think as we go through this and frankly not only ourselves with the entire market continues to learn in terms of what the competitive practices are in terms of designing lines constructing them etc.
I think we want to be part of the learning process and make sure we're making our proposals more competitive in the future.
So we're still capturing the lessons learned out of the Delaney-Colorado River experience but certainly support the process of the ISO's going through and evaluating proposals and accepting bids based on the parameters they are evaluating.
Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Your line is open.
Firstly just on the deferral -- the revenue deferral should we think of that as basically lining your actual expense up with where the revenues are going to be so there's really no earnings impact of this as we get -- once the GRC is done? Roughly that's what we're trying to do.
So maybe a bit less noise in the numbers? At least from that source.
Well the goal here in the May filing is really what you need to go back to is that the misalignment between the actual expenditures and the deductions we're taking and the forecast and the reserves are creating first and second quarter what we're trying to do is get this stuff put together and we recognized that they were misaligned.
And that's why we went back in for the supplemental filing.
And if they adopt that supplemental filing obviously that would not flow to earnings.
So if that's your initial question the answer would be yes.
And then just on to this question of the overlap between DRP projects and spending fact that you might otherwise -- things you might otherwise have done.
You have a 2017 -- you said it lot of the bulk of the initial DRP is in 2017.
You have a rate case filing in.
Is there overlap as you see it today or is this just things may evolve as you work through the next year or two? So it's not in the current GRC forecast.
The only way we have contemplated spending some money is if you don't spend all that is authorized for example if you have fewer service connections that we have forecast that creates some delta some room to spend additional dollars.
Now what I said in my prepared remarks if we spend all this authorized based on our forecast and we would like to make DRP expenditures above that that's where the memorandum account comes in why it's important.
So you don't get into any retroactive ratemaking issues.
But it would require some other line item to come in below the forecast for this to have to apply in the current rate case period? In that scenario yes or a memorandum account and spending above.
Okay.
And can I just -- MHI -- it was pretty publicly reported that your claims had increased very substantially versus prior disclosures.
Can you shed any light on that in the context of talking about confidentiality etc.? Jonathan I appreciate the question -- would love to tell you more but in accordance with our confidentially obligations we can't comment.
Our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar.
Your line is open.
I was wondering if we can go back to the DRP here yet again.
The 2018 2020 numbers -- I wonder if you could just qualitatively give us an idea of the difference in how the environment looks at the $1.4 billion low end and the $2.6 million high end.
It's obviously a large -- what difference happens there? This is Pedro again.
And I'll keep it at a pretty high level -- one of the reasons that we have the range there is that especially as we start getting out into the 2018 to 2020 time frame a lot of our view on the DRP is colored by our internal forecasting of the pace of adoption of technologies and how that pace of adoption varies across different parts of our system.
For example the capital spending forecast that we included in the DRP filing really focused on urban areas.
We're assuming that rural areas would not have as quick a pace of adoption and it might happen in later years.
We've taken a stab at what circuits might have a faster level of adoption versus a slower level of adoption.
But I think that range in there really is coupled back to where do customers end up choosing to deploy these technologies? How quickly do they do it? And what things do we need to do to ensure that our grid is ready to plug-and-play their choices? I think that's really the range as opposed to more a determinative decision on our part to invest here or there.
Some of this we're really changing the mindset here to make sure that we're supporting having a grid that's robust and that can keep pace and be ready for customer choices.
But we're taking a bit of a stab at this point as to what those customer choices will be.
Travis you can see on Page 6 of the investor deck the breakout of the spending.
$0.5 billion of it alone is the grid reinforcement.
That's what Pedro alluded to is taking the lower voltage circus circuits and taking up to higher voltage levels to prepare for more distributed generation.
And that's just pace.
How fast do you want to make those changes? That's a choice that we will have to make and the commission will have to make together.
One other variable that we cited in filing is -- again we're making forecasts based on our current view and the market's current view of technologies available.
For example communications systems.
We know we will need to broaden -- expand the capabilities of our field area network.
We're building these capital numbers based on the view of what those technologies will cost today but we all know that computing communications technologies are on a very fast development curve and so the actual prices the actual cost for those technologies can vary significantly as we head out a few years out.
Our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust.
Your line is open.
Coming back to SONGS for a second and just looking at the key gating items we should be keeping an eye on.
You've got that re-hearing request out there and then you've got the ALJ trying to close the OII proceeding that continue to get pushed back and now has that September 27 deadline recently approved.
How significant is that in the scheme of things? And if they stick to this final deadline and close the books does that imply some final resolution on this matter or is that irrelevant to this? We certainly hope that the CPUC will now conclude its consideration of the application for re-hearing motion for sanctions and the petition for modification of the settlement all by that September 27 date.
But frankly there's no guarantee.
That deadline for extension of the OII proceeding has been extended previously and it can be extended again.
Okay.
But that proceeding is the one sort of gating items to keep an eye on.
If they stick to that that could be the resolution date if you will of these matters? It could conceivably be.
Okay.
And separate question Ted to you as you think about your dividend plans going through the December period as you normally do are those going to be completely independent of these regulatory issues out there? For example if the GRC decision hasn't come out if SONGS settlement hasn't yet happened or closed would you still stick to your dividend plans based on your CapEx and cash flow programs or do these things influence how you are thinking about the dividend? I think I would probably want to leave investors with the emphasis being on we've stated numerous times what our objective is.
We've also stated numerous times -- and that's the return to the 45% to 55% payout ratio for SCE earnings.
And we've also stated that it will take -- it's not going to happen all in one shot.
We've made a very large kind of move last year.
We want to continue to make solid moves in order to get back to that payout ratio.
So that's where I would want to put the emphasis.
To say that we will do that come hell or high water -- you never can say that.
You have to take into consideration capital requirements take into consideration all of these other proceedings.
But at least as we see it today they all look like they are manageable within the context of continuing to make progress and deliver on one of our core objectives of getting back to the payout ratio of 45% to 55%.
Our last question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.
Your line is open.
Just a follow-up on Dan Eggers's question on the Delaney transmission project.
I guess what I'm sort of wondering is can you give us a feeling as to what -- you guys had the rights-of-way advantage you're local.
And Abengoa and Starwood come in and win not only over you guys but others.
What was their cost? What was their revenue requirement advantage that you think was instrumental in them getting the deal? I don't believe that the Cal ISO has published the cost estimate their revenue requirement for that project.
The goal we have at this point is a statement from the ISO that in their view the proposed cost for that Abengoa team were significantly less than those of the next competitor and I don't think the ISO has publicized to the next competitor was.
So it's tough to speculate on what some of the key drivers would have been.
But when you think about around cost of transmission project key elements would include everything from the upstream design of the project what kind of powers what kind of conductors to rights-of-way as you suggested to environmental impact and mitigating those impacts depending on what route you choose to the cost of the actual construction labor you are using to build.
Very difficult for us to speculate on what it would have been but again we note that the ISO said that the choice was based on the lower revenue requirement and also binding caps on capital costs and as well as the return on equity.
Okay.
Do you know when they are going to provide more information? Cal ISO I mean I don't think we're aware of that.
Okay.
And then just finally you mentioned the cost of capital in 2016.
When do you guys think that that might be revisited? It's been deferred in the past in terms of -- you guys had that separate cost of capital proceedings.
What's your expectation or what should we be thinking in terms of when the CPUC may go for this? And is there any potential that they may delay it? Okay.
Paul this is Jim.
Right now procedurally we would file in April 2016 for cost of capital effective 1/1/2017.
And that's cost of capital that would be return on common equity capital structure and the like.
That wouldn't preclude an extension like we've done before but the current policy or the current procedural path would be filing in April.
Okay.
Is there any thought that there -- or any discussion -- maybe it's early -- it's July I guess.
But is there any preliminary idea as to whether or not you might be able to defer that? It's a possibility.
We've deferred it once already.
This is the first time -- we've done it in the past and so generally the California utilities when I have talked with my compatriots at PG&amp;E and Sempro we like the procedure.
We like the trigger mechanism.
It's transparent.
You can see it you can see what's happening with it.
So there's a strong desire on our part to continue to use it.
If we can get an extension that would be great.
If we had to go there in litigated process we will just have to see where interest rates are.
And it seems like it's coming right back to where we started three years ago -- well now four if we get further on here.
So the mechanism has worked well given what we're trying to do.
Okay.
But do you get the feeling that your counterparties on the other side might be willing to do that as well? We've done it once already so we will have to see if they'd do it again.
Okay.
And just finally there is these legislative initiatives regarding the CPUC and other things but regarding the CPUC and perhaps reforms.
And there's been some changes and there are competing bills.
Anything in particular -- any particular legislative initiative we think we should focus on or anything in terms of that area that might be coming up? I know there are a few of them.
I was just wondering if there's one in particular that you think is more significant than others.
There is a hearing coming up in the middle of August directly related to ex parte governance issues at the CPUC.
There have been a number of independent reports that have been prepared for the CPUC.
There is a draft of the commissioner code of conduct that's been prepared and we welcome a transparent exercise considering reform to the ex parte and other governance rules of the commission.
That might be worthwhile listening in on.
Again I think it's in the middle of August so in a couple of weeks from now.
That was the last question.
I will now turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks for very much everyone for participating and please do call us if you have any follow-up questions.
Thanks again and have a safe day.
Bye bye.
Thank you for your participation in today's conference.
I will now disconnect the lines at this time.
Have a wonderful day.
Good afternoon and welcome to the Edison International third quarter 2015 financial teleconference.
My name is Brandon.
I will be your operator today.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks Brandon and welcome everyone.
Our principal speakers will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also here are other members of the management team.
Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com.
The key items are Form 10-Q Ted and Jim's prepared remarks and the presentation that accompanies Ted's comments Jim's comments.
Tomorrow afternoon we will distribute our regular business update presentation.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectations.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
Please read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measures.
During Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
I'll now turn the call over to Ted.
Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
Today we reported core earnings of $1.16 per share.
While this is well below last year's third quarter core earnings of $1.52 per share year-over-year third quarter earnings comparisons as was the case with the first two quarters of the year are not very useful.
This is because of the way we have had to recognize revenue with the delay in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case and how we are accounting for the recently released proposed decision.
We have said in the past that we would provide 2015 earnings guidance when we received a final GRC decision.
However with the noise in our quarterly earnings numbers we thought it a disservice to investors to have them guessing about 2015 earnings.
Therefore we decided it was best to provide 2015 guidance at this time today.
So today we introduced core earnings guidance for 2015 of $3.77 to $3.87 per share.
This guidance has some key assumptions that Jim will review in his comments.
Of course should the final GRC decision differ substantially from the proposed decision we may have to revisit our guidance.
We plan to return to our normal practice of providing annual earnings guidance for 2016 when we report full year 2015 results in late February.
One more comment on the General Rate Case.
While we feel the GRC proposed decision is overall generally constructive SCE identified several important issues in its October 8 comments to the CPUC.
Jim will cover most of these but I want to touch on one in particular.
The proposed decision attempts to recover certain tax repair benefits that were reflected in earnings in 2012 to 2014 through a permanent reduction to rate base of $344 million.
We consider this retroactive ratemaking and a potential violation of Internal Revenue Service rules.
We are hopeful that the CPUC will correct their legal error.
If the Commission were to adopt the proposed decision's retroactive treatment of repair deductions then SCE would be forced to write-off some or all of the $380 million regulatory asset related to future recovery of taxes.
The final decision on SCE's General Rate Case is currently scheduled for the November 5 CPUC meeting.
I assume most if not all of you are aware of the Administrative Law Judge's proposed decision released yesterday on penalties related to SONGS ex parte communications.
In short the ALJ found in her PD that there were eight communications that were late reported to the Commission and found two Rule 1.1 violations.
The PD proposed a $16.74 million penalty on Southern California Edison.
There are additional procedural steps yet to come on this issue but we are thankful that this appears to be moving towards resolution.
This has been a painful episode including for Edison and I feel obliged to make several comments on it.
First I want to set the record straight on some misconceptions that are constantly being repeated.
Contrary to the many reports SCE has not engaged in improper talks or communications with regulators related to the SONGS OII.
The important distinction is that the Judge found that we didn't report in a timely manner permissible communications with regulators.
The communications themselves were not found to be improper or illegal under the ex parte rules as certain parties have repeatedly and wrongly asserted.
In our recent filing we maintained that seven of these eight communications were either not required or outright not allowed to be reported under the ex parte rules.
The difference of opinion is a direct result of ambiguity in California's overly complicated ex parte rules.
Ambiguous rules require the parties to do their best to interpret them in practice which creates a risk.
We believe the rules need to be clarified and simplified so that we do not find ourselves underwriting the risk of after-the-fact reviews.
It is worth noting that even the ALJ concluded in her PD that the ex parte rules were ambiguous and cited that as a mitigating factor in calculating the penalty.
As I said in an earnings call a few quarters ago we look forward to working with President Picker to clarify the ex parte rules soon.
Many of the matters we deal with in our business involve tough judgment calls in contentious proceedings under ambiguous rules and conditions.
We don't particularly like it but it comes with territory.
We expect controversy.
We also expect a great deal of ourselves and our employees because we provide such an essential service to society and we rely on the public trust.
That is why it is important to do the right thing.
We expect nothing less of ourselves.
We want to earn the trust of our customers the public and the CPUC based on our conduct.
While we aren't perfect and there will be times when we fail to live up to our own expectations and those of others we must and we do set high standards of conduct for ourselves.
We have an obligation to be transparent and open and we will redouble our efforts to conduct ourselves in this manner.
We will also work hard to support President Picker's efforts to clarify and improve the current poorly crafted ex parte rules.
Strong efforts on both fronts will go a long way to avoiding a repeat of this in the future.
On a brighter note we were pleased to report last week the settlement reached with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited known as NEIL on insurance claims related to the shutdown of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
The settlement is for $400 million and covers all insurance claims by the three owners of SONGS related to the events leading to the shutdown.
All necessary approvals have been received from the owners and NEIL.
This is another important step in implementing the SONGS settlement approved unanimously by the CPUC last November.
Consistent with the SONGS settlement insurance recoveries will first pay associated legal costs and then 95% will be allocated to customers and 5% to the owners.
SCE customers will receive its allocation as a credit to the purchased power balancing account known as ERRA.
Assuming payment from NEIL is received in the fourth quarter then customer benefits should show up in their bills as a reduction in purchased power costs in 2016.
The larger claim against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the failed design of the replacement steam generators continues to proceed under binding arbitration through the International Chamber of Commerce.
We still expect a decision on that case by late 2016.
SCE's share of the NEIL recoveries and any MHI recoveries including recovery of legal costs will be treated as non-core.
That is they will not be included in our core earnings.
There is still much procedurally to be accomplished before the SONGS OII and related matters can be completed.
We are hopeful that this is all moving toward a conclusion this year or early next.
We continue to believe that no new information has been presented to suggest that the SONGS settlement was anything other than independently-negotiated that warrants continued full support by the CPUC and customers.
I'd like to turn to a couple of items that address some of our longer-term growth opportunities starting with SCE's Distribution Resources Plan or DRP.
Since the July 1 filing we have seen tremendous interest among stakeholders and some encouraging early support from a number of parties on our conceptual long-term approach.
Appropriately there will be concerns about cost and the pace of implementation of building a flexible 21st Century grid as outlined in our DRP filing.
We are awaiting a more definitive schedule for the balance of the proceeding which the CPUC indicates will be completed next spring.
This should give SCE adequate time to incorporate DRP elements into its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case which we expect to file in the fall of 2016.
Moving on the California legislature provided its own form of support for Governor Brown's low-carbon goals and the DRP with the passage of Senate Bill 350.
The Governor signed this bill into law earlier this month.
Senate Bill 350 will move renewables targets to 50% of delivered energy from qualifying renewable resources by 2030.
The current renewables target is 33% of delivered power by 2020.
The new law provides some valuable implementation flexibility that will help us meet the goals at the lowest reasonable cost to our customers.
It also provided legislative support for future utility investment in transportation electrification.
This is one of the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Southern California Edison just as we see similar opportunities around electric vehicle charging infrastructure and energy storage as complements to SCE's wires-focused investment strategy.
One final comment.
I continue to believe that we have an attractive multi-year dividend opportunity that complements a strong earnings growth outlook.
The GRC proposed decision the DRP and SB 350 are all data points that underscore SCE's growth potential.
This in turn reaffirms the dividend growth opportunity I've discussed on recent earnings calls.
We recognize that for a few years now we have been below our targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings.
We remain committed to moving well into that target range in steps overtime.
Hopefully we will be well along the way to resolution on both the SONGS OII and the GRC before the Board's usual December consideration of a dividend increase.
Even if both are not fully resolved by then I don't see it impacting our ability to continue to implement our dividend policy.
That concludes my comments.
Now Jim will provide his financial report.
Thanks Ted.
Good afternoon everyone.
I plan on covering third quarter and year-to-date results SCE's 2015 General Rate Case proposed decision capital spending and rate base forecast a few other financial topics and guidance.
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation.
Let me first address revenue recognition for the first six months and then for the third quarter.
For the first two quarters of this year we recorded revenues largely based on 2014 authorized revenues which included a revenue deferral of $85 million or $0.16 per share related to incremental flow-through tax repair deductions.
Our accounting was based on management judgment that these revenues would likely be refunded to customers.
Having received the proposed decision we updated our estimate of probable refunds to customers as part of our third quarter reporting.
This in turn lowered third quarter revenues.
The GRC-related revenue reduction was $0.42 per share.
This is comprised of the two elements shown under key earnings drivers at the right of the slide.
As Ted noted earnings comparisons will not be useful until we receive a final GRC decision and report full year 2015 earnings.
Of course if the final GRC decision is different than the proposed decision then there could be other related adjustments.
With that background I'd like to walk through the key earnings drivers starting with SCE.
There are two key earnings drivers of the $0.35 per share decline in SCE's earnings.
First as I mentioned before we recorded revenue largely based on the GRC proposed decision including a catch-up adjustment.
Second there were favorable cost and tax benefits realized in 2014 which did not recur in 2015.
Looking at revenue I've highlighted the $0.42 per share related to the GRC proposed decision.
$0.20 of this revenue reduction is from the flow-through tax repair benefits to customers with a related offset in the form of higher tax repair deductions.
The remaining decrease in GRC revenues are $0.22 per share.
Also we continue to see revenue increases from a growing FERC rate base and higher operating cost.
This is a positive $0.02 per share.
Lastly please note that the revenue variances is a net of SONGS for comparability.
The SONGS detail are footnoted.
Moving to the O&amp;M.
SCE had $0.03 per share in higher costs this quarter versus the third quarter of last year.
This includes $0.01 per share of additional severance at SCE.
Depreciation is $0.02 per share higher primarily due to transmission and distribution investments.
Net financing cost provided a $0.02 per share benefit primarily due to higher earnings from AFUDC.
Turning to taxes.
I've already covered the $0.20 per share for the 2015 repair deductions.
Most of the remaining variance relates to the $0.11 per share in earnings from incremental repair deductions recorded last year.
In all SCE's third quarter core earnings are $1.19 per share down $0.35 from last year.
For the holding company costs are $0.01 per share higher than last year largely on lower income from Edison Capital.
I'll come back to Edison Capital later in my remarks.
Non-core earnings in the quarter of $0.13 per share largely relate to EME bankruptcy tax benefits and insurance recoveries.
Please turn to Page 3.
We've added this slide to simplify the explanation of third quarter core earnings.
As you can see the difference on this slide versus the prior slide is that we netted out the impact of lower revenues and income tax benefits related to repair deductions in 2015.
As indicated on this slide the two key drivers are the lower revenues based on the GRC proposed decision of $0.22 and the $0.11 of 2014 incremental repair deductions.
That gets us to $0.33 of the $0.35 reduction in third quarter SCE quarter earnings.
Please turn to Page 4.
For year-to-date earnings GRC-related revenue is $0.58 per share or lower reflecting the $0.42 for the third quarter and the $0.16 for the first half of the year.
Again this is a mix of lower tax repair revenues $0.36 per share which is offset in taxes and the third quarter revenue adjustment of $0.22 per share.
Most of the costs items continue their trend and for the year-to-date we also have higher depreciation and O&amp;M and lower financing costs from higher AFUDC earnings.
You will also see the significant impact in both years related to changes in uncertain tax positions and lower tax benefits in other areas.
Last year we also had the generator settlements and other items that are absent this year.
All in year-to-date SCE core earnings are $3.31 per share down $0.27 from last year.
Page 5 has a similar waterfall chart of year-to-date core earnings.
Please turn to Page 6.
This slide compares the key revenue and rate base differences between the 2015 GRC proposed decision and SCE's updated request.
The revenue adjustments are recorded in the third quarter; largely reflect the three quarters' worth of proposed decision's authorized annual revenue.
Please turn to Page 7.
This slide summarizes the most important issues identified in SCE's comments on the proposed decision.
Ted has already talked about the tax repair deduction issue.
Next is the customer deposit issue.
Since the 2003 GRC the CPUC has treated customer deposits as a rate base offset.
However PG&amp;E and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric do not have this adjustment.
The third item is a proposed reduction in the pole loading program.
The proposed decision did not approve approximately $100 million of capital which has a 2015 rate base impact of $73 million.
Putting aside the rate base adjustment for repair deductions the proposed decision would adopt 92% of our requested capital.
This is higher than previous GRCs and of course this percentage could change with a final decision.
I will note two other key issues.
The principal one is incentive compensation.
The proposed decision recommended significant reductions in authorized revenues related to incentive compensation for the entire workforce even though the jointly sponsored SCE and ORA compensation study concluded SCE's total compensation is on average 5% below market.
We are strong believers in a pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and incentive-based compensation for all employees not just executives is a fundamental element of that philosophy.
This reduction is larger than experienced in prior cases.
Lastly there is a $10 million disallowance for a contract termination payment dating back to SCE's commercial rooftop solar initiative.
We believe the termination payment is reasonable and benefited customers substantially.
In accounting for the quarter the revenue adjustments track the proposed decision except for two items the tax item and the solar program contract cancellation disallowance.
I'll pick this up later when I discuss the rate base forecast and earnings guidance.
Please turn to Page 8.
Pages 8 and 9 update forecasted capital expenditures and rate base for the GRC proposed decision and known FERC-related capital expenditure changes.
SCE is experiencing licensing and permitting delays with a few of its transmission projects notably the West of Devers project.
As a result the timing of expenditures was moved out beyond 2017.
Once SCE files its 2018 GRC application and we update our CapEx and rate base forecasts these delayed expenditures will appear back in the forecast.
The FERC adjustments are shown on the right side of the slide.
The balance of reduction is related to the GRC proposed decision largely infrastructure replacement inspection and maintenance and nonelectric facility capital projects.
Historically we have shown what we call a request level of capital expenditures and rate base and a lower range level.
As you can see on the charts on Pages 8 and 9 we have replaced the word request with the word outlook.
For CPUC capital we now forecast that we will spend all authorized dollars for 2015 through 2017.
For FERC capital we have continued our practice of reducing outlook expenditures by 12% to arrive at the range level of expenditures.
Once we file our 2018 general rate case we will revert back to using both request and range monikers.
As a reminder the CPUC capital expenditures do not include any Distribution Resources Plan expenditures.
We have asked the commission to approve a memorandum account so we can track costs associated with the DRP spending.
So if we were to spend all authorized CPUC amounts provided in the GRC proposed decision then we would need to have the DRP memorandum account in place in order to be allowed to seek cost recovery in the next GRC.
Beyond 2017 we still believe that long-term capital spending will continue to run at least $4 billion annually and spending could be higher depending upon CPUC approval in future rate cases.
Please turn to Page 9.
Based on our revised capital spending forecast from the prior slide we have updated our rate base forecast.
The updated rate base forecast yields compound annual growth rates of 8% from 2015 through 2017.
The prior forecast was 7% to 9% annually.
Consistent with our accounting for the proposed decision we have not factored in the proposed $344 million reduction in rate base related to the disputed tax repair deduction issue in this forecast.
If the final GRC decision adopts the rate base adjustment then each of the years rate base would decline by the adjustment amount.
Please turn to Page 10.
As expected the CPUC cost of capital mechanism did not trigger any change in allowed ROE for 2016.
Though the spot Moody's Baa Utility Index rate moved quite a bit the moving average dampened the full-year impact.
Starting October 1 we began the new measurement period starting with the moving average where the spot rate ended at September 30 at 5.45%.
We are currently scheduled to file our next cost of capital application in April 2016.
Please turn to Page 11.
This page covers a handful of other financial topics.
SCE's weighted-average common equity component for regulatory purposes was 49.5% at September 30 increasing from 48.9% we reported in the second quarter.
This excess equity gives us additional financial flexibility.
Next you will recall that SCE's fuel and purchased power balancing account or ERRA had been deeply under collected as recently as yearend 2014.
With a previous rate increase SONGS settlement refunds lower natural gas costs and the balancing account has moved to an over-collected position of $112 million as of September 30.
When SCE receives the NEIL settlement proceeds expected in the fourth quarter they will be credited to ERRA.
Turning to the holding company last month we renewed an EIX holding company shelf registration to provide us flexibility to access the capital markets as needed for liquidity and general corporate purposes.
EIX commercial paper outstanding was $738 million at September 30 compared to a total EIX credit facility of $1.18 billion.
Also earlier this month we reached an agreement to sell our remaining affordable housing portfolio at Edison Capital.
Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed pending final due diligence and negotiations.
In any case the amounts are not material and the transaction will be treated as non-core.
For the past few years Edison Capital's earnings have helped offset holding company costs.
Please turn to Page 12.
This page provides detail of our 2015 earnings guidance that Ted discussed.
We have followed the same approach we have used for the last several years.
We start with SCE rate base earnings.
We used the $23.1 billion weighted average rate base outlook as shown on Page 10.
Based on SCE's authorized capital structure and flat share count that gets us the $3.56 per share of rate base earnings.
We then identify $0.41 per share of SCE items that take earnings higher.
The principal item is the $0.31 per share revision to uncertain tax positions recorded in the second quarter.
We have also discussed AFUDC being a net positive factor for the year rather than just offsetting costs not recovered by general rate case revenues.
We continue to estimate $0.05 of energy efficiency earnings in the fourth quarter as previously disclosed.
We have recorded severance costs of $0.03 year-to-date.
The balance of all other items is a positive penny a share including the ex parte proposed penalty.
We have estimated full-year holding company costs at $0.15 getting us to the midpoint of $3.82 per share.
To the right we have included key guidance assumptions.
We had excluded the shareholder portion of the NEIL settlement proceeds and related litigation costs.
We consider these revenues non-core.
Our guidance tracks our accounting for the GRC proposed decision so it excludes the $344 million rate base adjustment for repair deductions and the solar termination payment disallowance.
That concludes my comments.
I will turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&amp;A.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Just want to follow-up on a couple of things in terms of spending outlook.
The memorandum account for the GRP spend that you'd like to effect could you talk a little bit procedurally just about how we should think about the steps to get approval for the memorandum account? Well we have actually already filed for it.
It was part of the DRP application that's gone in and procedurally the commission then will have to act and will look at over the SCE folks any time frame for that Pedro or Maria? This is Pedro Pizarro not just about the memo account but procedurally in the DRP filing there is public workshops that are scheduled for the November 9 to November 10 and there the PUC is looking at a broad DRP roadmap for how the DRP proceeding will be faced out in the next three to four years.
With respect to the memo account itself I don't think we have a specific timing.
We'd expect it would be handled as the proceeding moves along next year.
And then just follow-up on just thinking about the tax positions you highlighted in 2015.
There are a number of moving parts in terms of uncertain tax positions and lower tax benefits.
On a going forward basis in '16 and beyond without being specific numerically how should we think about those kinds of moving parts? When do they start to settle down and when will they become less material if you think future years? That's a good question.
And it really depends on ultimately how things turn out.
I can tell you for repair deduction that's been a challenging one for us to forecast accurately.
And I wouldn't expect that going forward that you will see potential shareholder benefits from repairs.
But there're other tax benefits we realized so it really comes to how accurate we are forecasting our cost versus what actually occur so there could be differences both for or against us.
And the other related piece is O&amp;M benefit that's the other companion we've been talking about this whole time where I think in the proposed decision it was clear that it left open the door that there could be incremental O&amp;M savings that we could realize and we've said repeatedly that we will continue to look for benefits to reduce our cost for our customers.
And as you think about those moving parts in terms of the magnitude or volatility I know it's hard to have a crystal ball to think about that.
But do you see the same degree of potential volatility in terms of movements in these accounts or are there reasons why that volatility might be reduced in future years? I think my answer around that was around repair deductions where I was talking about specifically the proposed decision I think effectively we'll probably capture those benefits.
And there is also a balancing account that has been set up for our pole loading program which a lot of the repair deductions are rising from.
That's why these repair benefits have increased so dramatically over the last three years.
So with that balancing account there's not an opportunity for earnings or losses associated with differences from forecast.
A lot of complexity there sorry for all the -- there is still more to be written here until we get a final decision.
Our next question is from Michael Weinstein with UBS.
It's Julien here.
So just following up here on the transmission reduction in the rate base can you elaborate a little bit on nature of the issues in pushing up this CapEx part one.
And perhaps part two there you talk about a $4 billion number but is that fair to say that there might be some higher oscillations in that call it rounded $4 billion number in the '18 period now that you've pushed out this transmission CapEx.
Just trying to get a sense of exactly what's going on in terms of those pieces.
So I'll just point you to Page 8 in the investor deck which has the capital expenditures and it provides the detail of the amounts that are changing.
In terms of the reasons what my script falls up on was these are permitting and scheduling delays and the principal the largest one is the West of Devers project.
There is some other smaller ones but West of Devers is a rather large project and we're just seeing it slip out in time.
And I'll pause and look over to Pedro and Maria to see if there is anything else to add? All right.
So that's what you've got.
Now as far as the above $4 billion -- Just to clarify if you will you guys have historically talked about hitting a $4 billion CapEx pace consistently does this now mean that you have call it a 2018 number that you're not closing here that would be call it materially above that $4 billion figure to reflect call it a one-time true up on the CapEx for transmission? Yes.
And this is going to be a difficult one because we don't have information in the public domain beyond '17.
So I'm just going to touch a couple of items that we see that are changing both up and down to be fair.
So clearly the DRP is a big element of potential new expenditures.
We've provided information at public domain and you can see there is substantial ramp up of expenditures since '17 and as you go into '18 but those expenditures will be subject to review as part of our general rate case process.
There are other things that are going up that would include our -- and we have an opportunity through the storage program.
We have an opportunity through electric vehicle charging program.
And those are still working their way through.
And all three of those just to emphasize are not included in the numbers we're seeing here today so there is some potential upside depending upon how those proceedings progress.
On the down side there is the transmission issue is they're still going to be -- we'll have to see where that goes as you fit each some of this larger projects and we've ramped up in transmission area then we ramp back down as they're finished and we'll get to a steady state of capital expenditures.
We will just have to see how load growth goes that could be up or down depending upon the health of the service territory and the penetration of distributed generation resources.
So I'll leave it there.
There is ups and downs.
There is probably more of a bias that we see to the upside because of some of these large projects.
And just to clarify in the transmission CapEx just a tad bit more is there any risk around obviously you had the competitive project allocated.
Is there any other moving piece that we should be aware of in the transmission bucket that could develop one way or another here? Obviously the permitting was kind of unexpected.
Nothing that would stand out right now Julien beside what I told you.
Our next question is from Hugh Wynne with Bernstein.
Jim I just had some what I hope are simple questions on Page7 around the rate case proposed decision.
On the left-hand column there the bottom bullet the $73 million pole loading capital spending reduction? And then in the parenthetical below that it says $100 million capital expenditure reduction.
What is the difference? To one's capital to one's closings and they don't always line up exactly.
And so really when you think about rate base it's what's close to plant.
So forecast don't line up exactly.
So they are basically telling you that they want you to spend $73 million more in your spending plan and that is reflected in closings fulfilling by $100 million.
That was reverse.
So they've taken out of the -- in the PD they've take out $100 million of capital expenditures which translates into $73 million of rate base.
So it's lower not higher.
And then the second point.
What is the bone of contention around the customer deposits? When you look at our forecast they take the $180 million of customer deposits and reduce our rate base by that amount.
And the bone of contentions is if there is not similarity of treatment among the three utilities we seem to be treated differently as a result of whatever reason.
And then we've had this -- we keep raising this issue in the last several GRCs and there is inconsistent treatment.
We think that's unfair.
And then finally on the first point I agree with everything you say there in the second bullet that seems like retroactive ratemaking and violation of normalization regulations et cetera.
But presumably the ALJ who has a law degree and I don't has a different view.
Could you characterize the different perspectives around this point? Yes it would be hard to characterize it completely; there was a number of arguments.
But I think the simple argument that was made is that they set rates prospectively so therefore how could it be retroactive ratemaking.
We just fundamentally disagree on that point.
And so that's something we'll have to figure out hopefully in the final decision that will address this issue.
But we'll have to see.
Our next question is from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Just on the $80 million of compensation expense that wanted you to get recovery on.
Would you find ways to offset that or do you see opportunities to change your compensation structure like the other utilities to mitigate that drag? Well we'll certainly have to look at it.
It was obviously a sensitive issue in oral argument in our comments.
And we'll have to see what the final decision is.
And we'll have to see how it unfolds.
Hopefully they turn it around.
And then I guess on the $344 million for this year's guidance if you didn't get that or if the ALJ found against you what is your course legally to address that given the IRS issues and how would that affect the '15 guidance as you laid it out today? In the course of action here and I know Pedro talked about in the oral arguments and in our comments in the proposed decision that retroactive ratemaking then you have a legal recourse.
And there is a potential as Ted said in his script of a IRS issue it's a normalization violation.
So there is two different paths here that you might pursue.
Hopefully the Commission addresses that as part of the final decision but we will have to see.
So if it were adopted and I think it was clearly in my prepared remarks you'd have to take the $344 million off the rate base numbers for '15 through '17 to get back to an adjusted rate base approach.
Our next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.
Most my questions were answered.
There is a likely delay in the SONGS OII into early 2016 is there any impact to you providing 2016 guidance? I guess off the top of my head and I'll hesitate and look at my collogues here.
If we have a GRC decision I think that's the critical piece we need to move ahead in providing guidance for '16.
But I'll look at everybody else I don't see the SONGS being a factor that would slow us down.
And unless if they reject the whole decision and maybe I have to go back and rethink it but I think if we had a 2015 GRC final decision we'd find a way to give guidance for '16.
And then just on MHI we're obviously reaching some sort of a conclusion by hopefully the end of 2016.
Is there any opportunities to give some incremental data points on that or is it just one of those where you get an order you get a settlement you'll disclose it at the same time? So I'll pause here and look over to my friend Adam Umanoff our General Counsel.
Adam any pros of wisdom? No.
Really we can't provide any additional guidance.
We're operating under strict confidentiality rules of the International Chamber of Commerce proceedings.
So you'll have to wait for a final decision that's announced publicly.
Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Couple of quick questions on.
As we look forward Jim with Edison Capital out of the picture now is it reasonable to assume that that $0.15 drag from the parent company that you are sharing for 2015 is the kind of number we'd be looking at going forward with no offset or are there other things to think about that? We're a little premature on getting to that point.
We'll give you hopefully guidance when we report full year earnings at the end of February.
But clearly what I was trying to indicate in my prepared remarks that you lose that revenue source and so there might be a little upward pressure at the holding company.
And then secondly I think you said you booked the impact of the GRC PD through the first three quarters.
Is the fourth quarter impact just negative because it's lower revenue requirement or is there something else I need to think about? I'm looking over my accountants that booked the first three quarters.
Anything else in the fourth quarter that would be relevant to what Jonathan's brought up? We'll continue to follow the proposed decision until we get a final decision.
And then we'll look at what the terms are and adjust to the final decision.
So the guidance obviously Jonathan is adjusted to reflect what we think based on the proposed decision the fourth quarter will be.
And I guess just finally then should we read into the fact that your booking earnings according to the PD apart from the tax adjustment item is that your best estimate of whether it shakes out on your own accounting basis currently that you likely don't improve too much on the PD but you do when this one issue.
Is that how we should think about you giving guidance that way? I think our view was we felt it was important to get something out there as a stakeholder because there is going to be -- if you wait until you get a final decision it's really not clear that what it's going to be and we wouldn't get yearend earnings out until February.
We felt that it was better for investors as Ted said in his prepared remarks to give some clarity.
And I think we gave through our guidance you'll have enough pieces of information to make adjustments accordingly.
And so we felt that was the clearest and fairest way for everybody to do this.
And then just one other topic.
Ted I think you made the comment that you expect to; no you hope to have the SONGS issues result this year or at worst early next.
I just want to be clear that you are talking about the overall issue including the settlement not just the penalty piece when you make that comment? Yes.
Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
I was just curious when I look at the data on Page 15 in the 10-Q and kind of the new band for CapEx and that you've disclosed on the slides.
How should we think about how this impacts the timeline to get to a higher payout ratio? And CapEx coming down frees up some cash for the balance sheet in the cash flow statement by the time you get out to about 2018 2019 timeframe you'll have a higher earnings power you'll have higher cash from operations and at lower CapEx level.
Just curious about how you and the Board are thinking about kind of the timeline and the pace prior to get up for the dividend prior to getting the proposed decision versus going forward? Yes.
It's a good question.
I guess I would try to respond to it this way.
If you kind of pull up from looking at one year versus the next year any individual year with just kind of the larger theme the larger trends as you know I tried to strike this theme consistently we expect somewhere in this $4 billion-plus kind of annual CapEx.
We expect pretty significant rate base growth.
And we expect that as the base gets larger as the rate base gets larger we're going to have more cash flow.
So we feel that we're going keep a good balance between solid annual CapEx and related earnings from a growing rate base but cash to move us back in that 45% to 55%.
Any given year any couple of years you might run a little harder on CapEx you might run a little slower on CapEx that may give you on the margin a little more room to move on dividends or slow it down a little bit.
But fundamentally I think rather than try to pick it apart year-by-year that's the teeter totter.
It's keeping CapEx in that kind of $4-plus billion range and getting back solidly.
I think I use the term well within the range of 45% to 55%.
So I wouldn't get too wrapped up on any one year movement.
Both of those things are going to be really what we're focused on.
And we believe as a result we'll be able to provide investors with a higher than industry average growth rate in earnings and a higher than industry average growth rate in dividends.
Our next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Jim just to be clear on Slide 9 where you've laid out your rate base numbers new ones '15 through '17.
Just to understand the moving parts there once the GRC is finalized if I am hearing you right you've already assumed the big tax benefit and $180 million I believe goes in your favor if I heard you right.
And so if there is going to be any change to these numbers it's probably to the downside if they stick with the PD or is that further upside that maybe I'm missing here? So what I said was the $180 million the customer deposits is already baked into these numbers.
This is net of that.
And what also I said and I think we have it here on the first pull it on the right the $344 million rate base reduction for the repair deduction is not included in these numbers is not.
And so to the extent if the commission were to decide to adopt it then you need to reduce these numbers by the $344 million.
But also if they stick with the PD on the customer deposit that would be another $180 million reduction? No.
I'm sorry.
We incorporated the $180 million already.
Are you stuck with the PD on the $180 million? Yes.
So the only things that we haven't adopted from the PD are the tax issue the $344 million rate base reduction.
And the second thing is the SunPower termination payment for the solar panels.
Those are the only two items we have not incorporated.
And then secondly on the SONGS process just to be clear on resolutions so the PD came out on the ex parte issue and may come up on the December meeting.
Should we now expect another PD has to be issued on the petition for modification and then at some later date that gets picked up by the CPUC or what is exactly the process for dealing with those modification petitions? Adam you want to take that? Sure.
And you're right.
There are separate petitions for modifications and a request for rehearing all of which are pending and for which there has been no decision by the commission.
I really can't tell you when to expect a decision.
As Ted pointed out we're hopeful that we'll see a decision later this year or early next year.
Once that decision comes out there will be an opportunity for parties to comment before it is final.
But to be clear Adam you need to first have a PD which will set a 30-day clock on those issues? Yes on the petitions for modification that's right there will be a PD a comment period and then a final decision.
Our next question is from Greg Oro with Barclays.
Back to Page 12 just regarding the AFUDC at $0.07 that it is added back is that a good number going forward just as an average is there a timing issue in there or maybe I need more of a discussion what that is? Well we're happy to have a further discussion but there is a lot of moving parts associated with AFUDC.
Historically the way we've done this over the last several years we assume that AFUDC earnings offset all the cost that aren't not recovered through the rate making process.
There is executive compensation Board related cost our corporate dues and philanthropy activities.
There is a whole bucket of that costs that aren't recovered and we have assumed historically that AFUDC earnings offset those.
And what can cause it to go up or down is the balance of what's in the account or the rate.
So the rate can go up and down depending upon what's happening at any point in time.
So I think for planning purposes it's probably appropriate to assume that AFUDC will not come out again in the future in terms of providing the benefit and go back to that rate base approach as the core utility source of earnings and a little bit of energy efficiency that we've talked about repeatedly adjusted for the holding company cost to get you to a decent starting point.
Our last question is from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.
So I'll be quick given it's a long call and the last question.
So just quickly on the rate base that you've guided to now if we had to bridge from the last quarter to this quarter in terms of rate base is it just the CapEx and these GRC adjustments that you've talked about or is there other stuff that we should be thinking about in terms of reaching from last quarter to this quarter rate base? So the two principal items are the GRC adjustments and the FERC delays.
And you can see the dollar amounts of the FERC delays that's shown on Page 9 -- I'm sorry Page 8 it has both rate base and capital expenditures and the balance is what the commission did not pick up as part of the rate making process.
Scott anything else fits in there? And probably just remember as Jim said in his remarks so the FERC spending is being pushed out so you would model it later.
After the current forecast period you see it picking up in 2018 and beyond.
And just quickly the final question was on that point itself which is you talk about the long-term $4 billion annually.
When you say long-term how long is long-term when you think of it is? Is it a three-year window five year window just so we have a sense of what is it? I don't want to be flip and say it is Wall Street long-term.
But I think it is appropriate to think through the 18 generate case cycle.
That was the last question.
I will now turn the call back to the Mr.
Cunningham.
End of Q&amp;A Thanks very much everyone for participating and don't hesitate to call us if you have any follow-up questions.
Thanks and good afternoon.
Thank you for participating in today's conference.
All lines may disconnect at this time.
Good afternoon and welcome to the Edison International Fourth Quarter 2015 Financial Teleconference.
My name is Mary and I will be your operator today.
Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Scott Cunningham Vice President of Investor Relations.
Mr.
Cunningham you may begin your conference.
Thanks Mary and welcome everyone.
Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci.
Also here are other members of the management team.
Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com.
These include our Form 10-Q Ted's and Jim's prepared remarks and the presentation that accompanies Jim's comments.
Tomorrow afternoon we will distribute our regular business update presentation.
During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries.
Actual results could differ materially from current expectation.
Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings.
Please read these carefully.
The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
During Q&amp;A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
I'll now turn the call over to Ted.
Jr.
- Chairman President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thank you Scott and good afternoon everyone.
In my remarks today I will touch briefly on our 2015 performance and then focus on Southern California Edison's and Edison Energy Group's long-term growth opportunity.
Closing out one year and starting a new one is a natural time to reflect on some of the longer-term themes.
Full year 2015 core earnings were $4.10 per share $0.23 above the high end of our core earnings guidance range.
We also introduced today our 2016 core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 per share which reflects SCE's strong rate base growth a continuing focus on improvements in operational efficiency and ongoing energy efficiency incentives.
We believe that SCE's rate base is the best proxy for long-term earnings growth potential.
As Jim will soon describe in more detail we have updated our forecast of SCE's rate base through 2017.
Rate base for 2015 increased $300 million and our forecast for 2016 rate base also increased by $300 million.
The rate base for 2017 increased by $100 million.
It seems some investors have been expecting a substantial decline in rate base due to bonus depreciation but the effect of bonus depreciation is less and there are other offsets.
Bonus depreciation did not have any significant impact on 2015.
Impacts pick up somewhat in 2016 and 2017.
Bonus depreciation impacts are more than offset by a higher rate base from our distribution pole loading program on which we earn a rate of return as prescribed in SCE's 2015 general rate case.
Jim will provide a more fulsome explanation but the bottom line is that we expect rate base to be slightly higher in 2017 than our previous forecast after taking into account the final general rate case decision and the full effect of bonus depreciation.
Customers will see the benefits of SCE's continuing efforts to reduce cost.
Through these efforts together with lower fuel and purchase power cost the NEIL insurance settlement of our San Onofre claims and the 2015 GRC customers will receive on average a reduction in 2016 rates of 8%.
This is a significant benefit for our customers and something we are very pleased to deliver to them.
SCE's share of the $400 million NEIL settlement was $313 million.
After legal expenses 95% went to customers.
This is another example of the benefits of the San Onofre settlement unanimously approved by the CPUC in 2014.
The last major step in implementing the settlement will be resolution of our pending and arbitration case with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
Hearings before the three-judge panel are expected this spring.
We still expect a decision late this year.
As we've said previously we are under confidentiality provisions during the litigation process so we don't expect to have further updates unless there is some material development.
The CPUC's December decision on ex-parte communications completed its consideration of the matters of the SONGS OII.
The challenges to the Commission's approval of the settlement remain pending.
We have no estimates on the timeframe to decide those challenges.
In the meantime we are focused on the safety commissioning of San Onofre.
Based on our current decommissioning cost estimates our decommissioning trust funds are adequately funded and not expected to require any further customer contributions.
Our December dividend increase of $0.25 the second in as many years equates to a 47% payout based on the midpoint of our 2016 SCE earnings guidance.
We continue to see an excellent dividend growth opportunity as we grow SCE earnings and move up through our current targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings.
I won't attempt a prediction of future dividend increases but I will describe our thinking.
Our earnings growth is largely driven by long-term rate base growth.
After depreciation capital spending of approximately $4 billion a year will translate into rate base growing by roughly $2 billion a year.
This would yield a 7% annual rate base growth potential for some years to come and if we have higher annual CapEx we will have a higher rate base growth rate.
Additionally moving the dividend payout ratio further up in our targeted 45% to 55% range only adds to the potential annual dividend growth rate.
We believe that we are well-positioned for sustained growth in rate base and earnings at SCE.
We have positioned SCE as a wires-focused business consistent with our views on industry transformation and in alignment with California's public policy objectives to move the state to a low carbon economy.
We see more opportunities for growth than we do threats in the changes occurring in our industry.
Recently we have taken steps to further position Edison Energy Group to develop those opportunities.
We are focused on finding those areas where customers' needs are unmet that match well with our competitive advantages and that hold promise for scaling-up sufficiently.
Edison Energy Group continues to expand into businesses that meet this profile including distributed solar generation energy services for commercial and industrial companies providing new sources of water and competitive transmission.
Our SoCore Energy subsidiary added more commercial rooftop solar customers in 2015 and now has nearly 250 projects operating in 16 states.
It has expanded beyond rooftop installations to ground-mounted projects serving both community solar and rural electric cooperatives.
SoCore also piloted an innovative project for Cinemark Theaters that combined its rooftop solar panels with energy storage from Tesla Energy.
We continue to build out an integrated energy services platform which we call Edison Energy to address the needs of commercial and industrial companies.
Our market research has led us to conclude that the largest commercial and industrial companies with multi-state operations are underserved nationally in their energy needs and struggle to deal locally with many different utilities tariffs and new technologies.
We believe we possess several competitive advantages to succeed with customers in this new and quickly evolving power environment.
Our roots are as developers operators and investors in complex infrastructure.
We have deep technical commercial and regulatory experience and knowledge of the power system.
Our brand and substantial size gives customers confidence in our ability to deliver and contrasts with the dizzying array of untested start-ups.
Our platform was expanded through some recent smaller acquisitions in the area of energy engineering and in consulting that was Eneractive Solutions; energy procurement advisory services which was Delta Energy; and sourcing off-site renewable energy which was Altenex.
Edison Energy now counts one quarter of the Fortune 50 companies as clients including General Motors Microsoft and Procter &amp; Gamble.
Next month Edison Energy will launch marketing efforts to larger C&amp;I companies emphasizing its abilities as a comprehensive integrated energy service solution provider.
Today these new businesses are small even though we think the opportunities could be significant.
Currently the vast majority of our capital is dedicated to our core business modernizing the electric grid at SCE and to moving up our dividend ratio payout ratio closer to the industry norm.
Our approach to these new businesses will be disciplined focused on small initial investments to understand strategic fit profit drivers and scalability.
We have allocated some capital to testing and building our new businesses but it is currently only around 1% to 2% of the total capital deployed at Edison International.
We are gaining confidence that there is indeed a market need for these new businesses and that they can be profitable.
The major question is whether these businesses can be scaled up sufficiently to be significant to a company our size.
If performance warrants and the opportunities continue to look sizeable we are in a position to increase our commitment.
We are encouraged but ultimately we will be driven by results.
So to summarize our strategy has three themes.
Theme one operate with excellence meaning we operate our existing business with a focus on controlling costs and customer rates and improving service to our utility customers.
Theme two build the 21st century power network.
This means we invest in our existing business and manage the unprecedented changes in policy and technology.
And theme three is to expand our growth potential.
We systematically explore new growth opportunities by making disciplined investments where industry changes are producing unmet customer need where we believe Edison has competitive advantages and where scalable opportunities exist.
Concentrating on these three strategic themes will allow us to remain relevant to our existing customers produce higher than industry average growth in earnings and dividends and provide the flexibility to adapt and grow in a climate of rapid change.
So that's it for the big themes.
Let me now turn the call over to Jim.
Thanks Ted.
Good afternoon everyone.
My remarks will cover fourth quarter and full year results our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts and our 2016 earnings guidance.
I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results.
Please turn to page 2 of the presentation.
SCE's fourth quarter 2015 earnings are $0.89 per share down $0.20 per share from last year but well ahead of the $0.66 per share implied by the midpoint of our 2015 earnings guidance.
Looking at the year-over-year comparison two items from last year stand out.
First is the $0.15 per share income tax variance as shown in the right table.
As part of the 2015 general rate case decision differences in tax repair benefits for 2015 through 2017 flow through the tax accounting memorandum account or TAMA and do not affect earnings.
Second is last year's $0.05 per share benefit from resolution of an income tax item from the 2012 GRC.
This was recorded in revenues last year and is part of the $0.15 per share revenue variance.
A key item and something that was not included in our 2015 earnings guidance is an $0.08 per share benefit from a new balancing account for SCE's distribution pole inspection and replacement program.
Let me provide some additional background.
The 2015 GRC established a new balancing account to track costs to inspect distribution poles and to repair or replace them as needed.
This is called the Pole Loading and Deteriorated Pole Balancing Account or simply the pole loading balancing account.
Balancing account allows SCE to true up from actual O&amp;M and capital expenditures.
For 2015 actual capital expenditures substantially exceeded amounts included in the GRC decision.
Because of the lateness of the GRC decision the Commission did not limit expenditures for 2015 but did limit expenditures for 2016 and 2017.
Switching now from pole capital expenditures to rate base the 2015 GRC decision included a pole loading rate base forecast of $296 million.
Based on actual expenditures since the inception of the program the 2015 rate base for poles increased to $625 million.
As a result of the higher rate base SCE recorded additional revenues through the pole loading balancing account to earn its authorized rate of return on the incremental rate base of $329 million.
The additional $0.08 per share of earnings is based on both equity and debt returns at the blended authorized rate of 7.9%.
The balancing account impact was finalized as part of our year-end reporting cycle and was not previously included in our earnings guidance.
The balance of the revenue variance largely reflects the implementation of the 2015 GRC which lowered authorized revenues as expected.
For the fourth quarter O&amp;M is a net positive $0.07 per share.
O&amp;M includes both the ex-parte penalty of $0.05 per share and $0.03 for additional severance costs as part of SCE's ongoing operational excellence efforts.
The balance of O&amp;M benefits are from lower transmission distribution and legal costs.
Lower net financing costs are a benefit of $0.03 per share.
The incremental tax benefits from 2014 that I mentioned drive the unfavorable tax comparison.
One important item that was not a key earnings driver in the quarter is bonus depreciation from the 2015 tax law change.
Bonus depreciation did reduce average rate base but only by a nominal amount or a net $31 million.
The nominal impact is much less than our general statement that a 50% bonus extension could reduce rate base by $400 million each year.
I've come to the conclusion that it's very difficult to effectively estimate the impact of bonus extension until you do the detailed analysis.
The fact is there are second and third order effects that can occur making our general statement accurate only with a controlled set of assumptions.
With this preamble there are three primary factors that reduced the impact of bonus deprecation on 2015 versus our prior forecast.
First under normalization rules bonus depreciation is pro-rated in the first year in which capital additions are estimated to be put into service.
Second certain 2015 capital additions relate to work that began in 2014 and are eligible under 2014 bonus depreciation and thus were included in our prior rate case forecast.
Third the shift in tax payments caused 2015 working cash to increase.
For rate making purposes working cash is a component of rate base.
Later in my presentation I will provide a complete reconciliation of rate base changes for 2015 through 2017.
As part of the key earnings drivers revenues and income taxes are lower due to the higher tax repair deductions recorded through the pole loading and TAMA accounts.
The higher tax repair deductions in 2015 do not affect earnings and are not shown on the right side of the slide as they are netted out.
The total impact for the quarter is $0.45 per share in lower revenues and income taxes.
For the holding company costs are unchanged at $0.01 per share.
For SCE non-core items in the quarter include the previously announced $1.18 per share charge related to the write-down of the regulatory assets for incremental tax repair deductions for the 2012 through 2014 period.
It also includes a $0.04 per share benefit from the NEIL insurance settlement and legal cost recoveries related to SONGS.
Holding company non-core items include a $0.03 per share gain on the sale of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio at year-end and a $0.01 per share related to accounting for income tax attributes related to SoCore's tax equity financing.
Discontinued operations include a $0.02 per share EME-related cost for changes in net liabilities for retirement plans and additional insurance recoveries.
Page 15 has a detailed summary of all non-core items.
Please turn to page 3.
Full-year 2015 core earnings are $4.10 per share down $0.49 from a year ago.
SCE's 2015 earnings largely reflect the impacts of the 2015 GRC decision especially the treatment of excess tax repair deductions together with the other fourth quarter key drivers I mentioned earlier.
Excluding the tax repair deductions now tracked in the pole loading and TAMA accounts CPUC jurisdictional revenue is down $0.39 per share while FERC revenue is up $0.14 per share.
Among the key cost components the favorable O&amp;M trend relates largely to the positive fourth quarter factors discussed previously.
The favorable net financing costs are mainly from higher AFUDC earnings that we have been reporting all year.
The major driver of lower earnings this year is the loss of tax repair benefits.
In 2014 we recognized $0.41 of tax repair benefits.
In 2015 these benefits either flow through the pole loading or TAMA accounts without impacting earnings.
Full-year holding company costs are $0.01 per share above last year due to higher income taxes and expenses.
Please turn to page 4.
This slide walks through the key differences between our 2015 core earnings of $4.10 per share versus the midpoint of our guidance of $3.82.
First you'll see the $0.08 per share related to the $329 million increase in pole loading rate base I discussed earlier.
The additional equity return is $0.05 and the debt and preferred return is $0.03 per share.
O&amp;M is favorable $0.08 per share due mainly to the factors I mentioned earlier.
The other financing benefit is AFUDC at $0.01 per share.
Taxes are the other driver due to the implementation of the TAMA account and clarification of treatment of tax items that would otherwise negatively impact earnings but now flow through this account.
Holding company costs are at $0.05 per share positive variance due to higher income from Edison Capital and income tax benefits.
Please turn to page 5.
SCE's capital spending forecast increased slightly adding $300 million in 2016 and $100 million in 2017 as Ted has already mentioned.
The 2016 change principally relates to an updated estimate for pole loading expenditures up to the cap provided in the 2015 GRC decision and for cumulative spending in 2016 and 2017.
This incremental spend will flow into rate base as you will see in a minute.
The 2017 increase relates to modest changes in the scope and timing of FERC transmission investments.
SCE's current forecast does not include any incremental spending on distribution resources plan activities.
The forecast also excludes any energy storage investments or Phase 2 of the Charge Ready program.
Please turn to page 6.
A third major transmission project the Mesa Substation has been included in our capital spending forecasts for some time but has advanced sufficiently through the regulatory approval process that we felt it appropriate to describe more fully.
This is the replacement of a 220 kV substation with a 500 kV substation.
It will provide additional transmission import capability allowing greater flexibility in the siting of new generation and reducing the amount of new generation required to meet local reliability needs in the Western Los Angeles Basin.
This is a Cal ISO approved project.
Please turn to page seven.
This page shows the increase in SCE's rate base forecast that Ted mentioned.
I will explain the changes in a moment.
The two-year compound annual growth rate for both the Outlook and Range cases is 7%.
With the complexity associated with the extension of bonus deprecation and the normal changes to our capital expenditures flowing into rate base we felt it would be helpful to provide a more fulsome reconciliation of rate base changes.
Please turn to page eight.
For 2015 we ended the year with $329 million of additional rate base from pole loading capital expenditures.
As I mentioned earlier the extension of bonus for 2015 is lost in the rounding.
We estimate the impact of bonus depreciation to be about $300 million in 2016 and $700 million in 2017 relative to our prior forecast.
The incremental additions to rate base from a pole loading account activity is about $600 million in 2016 and about $700 million in 2017.
In effect the impact of bonus is offset by the change in the pole loading rate base.
Net net net relative to our prior forecast rate base increases $300 million in 2016 and $100 million in 2017.
Lastly we plan to update our capital spending and rate base forecasts through 2020 when we file our next general rate case in early September.
Please turn to page nine.
Today we introduced 2016 earnings guidance with a midpoint of $3.91 per share with a range of plus or minus $0.10 per share.
For SCE we start with the rate base forecast of $25.1 billion shown on page 7.
The rate base math yields earnings of $3.81 per share.
While a number of positive variance in 2015 may not recur in 2016 we do expect additional earnings contribution from the energy efficiency of $0.05 per share.
We also anticipate incremental productivity and financing benefits of $0.17 per share.
This implies earnings of $4.09 per share at SCE.
Lastly we deduct $0.18 per share for holding company costs with no range.
In the past I've talked about holding company costs of roughly $0.15 per year and on our last call we pointed out that the sale of Edison Capital would eliminate the earnings contribution this business provided.
The $0.10 per share loss for 2015 included $0.06 of income from Edison Capital.
The increase over 2015 relates primarily to higher financing costs.
Please turn to page 10.
The last slide reinforces our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among large cap utilities for rate base earnings and dividend growth.
Thanks and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&amp;A.
Thank you.
Our first question coming from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.
Your line open.
Hi good afternoon and congratulations.
Jr.
- Chairman President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks Julien.
Great.
So first Ted let's start with your opening comments on the call at the services side of the business.
I'd be curious as you see that scaling you've done some acquisitions here what kind of earnings power could we'd be looking at over the years? What kind of contributions and when do you see that happening? Jr.
- Chairman President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> It's a great question and words were chosen pretty carefully to indicate.
At this point we want to try to do more in the testing side make sure that we actually think that we've got a business here that really makes sense and that is scalable.
It's that last part that I think we're spending most of our time on now.
Assuming it's scalable and assuming we can make those kinds of investments that would really allow us to fully capture the opportunity to be relevant to a company our size we've generally thought that the suite of businesses on the Edison Energy side so not just energy services stuff I spent a lot of my comments on but really the whole group of companies there this probably got to be just as a general rule of thumb I'd say it's got to be somewhere in the 10% to be significant or meaningful to a company our size.
So I think we want to see steady progress in that direction.
We want to see that these things are capable of actually scaling to that size.
But assuming that things continue on in the path at least we see in these very early days that's the type of magnitude that we would be looking for.
Got it.
Excellent.
And turning to the numbers a little bit just as a follow-up quickly can you elaborate a little bit more Jim on the rate base offset here on 2015 just as you think about the number being supposedly less than you had initially supposed or at least thrown out there? What's the exact accounting there? So there's a couple of things going on.
Bonus depreciation did not have impact in 2015 because of the items that I ticked through.
There's a number of things that really offset it the biggest piece being the proration bonus depreciation in the first year and the overlap of those that float from 2014 into 2015 that we had already accounted for.
And the biggest thing here is the pole loading program.
We picked up a little over $300 million of rate base from pole loading that was not included in our prior forecast that we included now based on our year-end review and that's the biggest offset for 2015.
And you can see bonus growing in 2016 and 2017 as you expect.
It would be at 50% and it reaches up to $700 million impact by 2017.
But really what's happening in the pole loading program in a sense is offsetting the bonus depreciation and it gets up to – pole loading gets up to $700 million.
And so the only changes really going on are the small changes in and around what's happening with FERC and a little bit of the CPUC.
So we do have an increase in rate base ultimately through 2016 and 2017 but the bonus depreciation is offset by the pole loading program.
So page 8 if you don't have it there really kind of describes the full details of how rate base changed over this three-year period and I think it's probably the most helpful tool.
Indeed.
Thank you.
All right Julien.
Thank you.
Our next question coming from the Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Your line is open.
Inc.</span></strong> Yeah.
Good afternoon guys.
Hey Jonathan.
Inc.</span></strong> Just a quick one follow-up on the pole loading.
And I think you mentioned the year-end review Jim.
Can you just talk us through a little bit how that processed and it seems like you would have known about this when we can kind of met you at EEI for example.
So I was just curious kind of how it sort of changed so much.
It's a darn good question.
In going through the general rate case decision there was some confusion over how it actually operate and it came after further review in discussion that we were picking up – there was no limit to capital expenditures from the inception of the program through 2015.
And the actual final decision included really for all intention purposes an estimate of pole loading based on some preliminary work.
And because we were able to true up for actual capital expenditures that delta fell out when we went through and reviewed it in more detail.
So as you recall as we were going through the guidance as we got into the third quarter I think for all intention purposes we are so focused on repair deductions in getting all that accounting right and understanding it that we didn't fully appreciate what was happening with pole loading and so we picked it up as far as our fourth quarter accounting enclosure.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thanks for that.
And then just on the $0.18 drag the parent and other for 2016 would you – in terms of getting a sense of how much these other businesses are a drag on numbers today obviously hopefully there'll potentially be an opportunity at some point how much of that $0.18 is associated with investments you're making in early stage businesses? If you weren't making them would be there...
Yeah.
No it's a good question.
And what's happened in the last couple of year Edison Capital the sell down on that portfolio has been masking some of the ongoing costs that are occurring at the holding company.
And for all intents and purposes the change I mentioned in my comments that we've guided people that the holding company cost on an annual basis taking out Edison Capital had been running at about $0.15 and that we bumped that up to $0.18.
And the delta is primarily financing cost not Edison Energy.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And do you see the Edison Energy costs kind of ticking higher before the net kind of comes – moves in the other direction I guess? We're going to grow the businesses but we also expect earnings from the businesses too.
So that we'll have to see how it plays out going forward and you can see we didn't have growth year-over-year from Edison Energy and we acquired three businesses.
They have ongoing earnings.
So our goal ultimately would be a source of earnings not use.
So we'll have to see how things develop as we move down the road here.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
And one other topic we read recently that there is kind of a new resource planning regime coming at the PUC out of SB 350 requiring integrated resource plans.
Could you talk a little bit about that and how you see it changing how you've operated if at all? Jr.
- Chairman President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I'd like to turn that question over to Pedro.
Southern California Edison Co.</span></strong> Hey Jonathan.
It's Pedro Pizarro.
How are you? Inc.</span></strong> Good.
Thank you.
Southern California Edison Co.</span></strong> So SB 350 the bill that implemented the 50% renewables by 2030 for the state along with some actions on electric transportation calls for an integrated resource planning process.
It's early days for that Jonathan.
It will work its way through the CPUC.
Our view of that and view of the legislative intent in it is that it will help provide the PUC and state agencies a macro view a planning perspective of how all the pieces fit together.
We don't see necessarily they're significantly changing the nuts and bolts of the procurement process that we have because it's a pretty well prescribed process for that.
I think as we understand the intent it's more of a macro view on how the pieces will fit together across different kinds of renewable resources transmission et cetera but in reality the details will be worked out through the PUC process.
Inc.</span></strong> Any sense of when you would have to file (38:43) such a plan? Southern California Edison Co.</span></strong> I don't know Jonathan.
I know that that's just beginning to work its way through the PUC.
I believe there's been some scoping work there.
So probably within a year or so will be the likely timeline.
Inc.</span></strong> Great all right.
Thanks a lot.
Southern California Edison Co.</span></strong> It's not a next month kind of item.
Inc.</span></strong> Perfect.
Got it.
Thank you.
Southern California Edison Co.</span></strong> Sure.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Your line is open.
Hey guys.
Congrats to a good year and start to 2016.
One question for Jim one for Ted.
Jim just curious the $0.17 at SoCal had in guidance for 2016 for what sounds like a combination of O&amp;M management as well as some financing benefit how should people think about the that longer-term meaning after 2016 whether you'll be able to keep that in 2017 or 2018 whether we should assume some of that continues in the 2017 but eventually that all kind of flows back to customers? You're correct.
In 2017 it's the third year of the rate case cycle the three-year rate case cycle so you would expect us to hopefully retain some portion of that going forward.
And 2018 is the general rate case the test year.
So the benefits we've derived over the prior rate case cycle flows to the customers.
But again our goal would be to seek additional operational savings.
There's more work to be done and we'll continue to focus on that so we would hope to achieve some level of savings.
I'm not going to predict what those might be.
And the other piece here the embedded cost of debt we wouldn't file a general – our cost of capital proceeding would be effective and we'd litigated in 2017 for 1/1/2018 effectiveness assuming we don't extend it again.
And so we would expect in 2018 that we would true up the embedded cost of debt at that time unless we extend it again.
So there is a...
Got it....
...a number of the things that will be going up and down and we will just have to depend – our purpose here is to try to find additional savings but a lot of it will toss back in 2018 as we reset our rates.
Got it.
And Ted when you are kind of looking at it and at the distribution resource plan for the future the different utilities have taken different tacks about how much they want to put out in the public domain or how much they want to put in front of the regulator about what the spending levels could be.
You've been much more robust in terms of kind of spending through 2017 and then spending from 2018 to 2020.
How do you expect the regulatory process to play out and when do you expect to get some certainty and actually put some capital to work on this? Jr.
- Chairman President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think probably the short answer is based on what reaction we've gotten so far on the distribution resources plan it looks like it's going to be probably more of a discussion in the 2018 to 2020 rate case.
It's possible some other things will move in there.
I mean we've had some things such as the Charge Ready program and a few of these but I think the bulk of the discussion around what those expenditures for modernizing the grid would look like.
And...
So in other words that spend in the 2015 to 2017 timeframe is that spend you don't actually expect to get approval to do the just a couple of hundred million dollar level? Jr.
- Chairman President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I've not seen a ready vehicle for being able to make any significant investments in the near term.
So absent that I think most of the discussion would be in the 2018 to 2020 period with the upcoming rate case.
Got it.
Thank you guys.
Much appreciated.
Jr.
- Chairman President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> You're welcome.
Thanks Michael.
Thank you.
Our next question coming from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.
Your line is open.
Yeah.
Hi good afternoon guys.
Just Ted on the dividend commentary just wanted to clarify obviously it's the same payout range of 45% to 55%.
I think the language you used was through the payout range and kind of I think you at some point even said targeting more over time toward the industry averages.
Are you kind of implying that you're now targeting at least the high end of this range and may be looking to raise the range over time? Jr.
- Chairman President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
In probably as Jim likes to say my usual way trying to be clear but vague.
I guess I would – what I'm trying to point out are a couple of things.
One just the rate base mechanism that converts into earnings suggests to us this kind of 7-ish 7% kind of a growth opportunity that would translate through to dividends but we're at the bottom end of the range based on the midpoint of the 2016 earnings guidance range that we just gave.
Depending on where earnings actually come out depending on how we would look at moving our way through the 45% to 55% we would kind of view that 7% as more of a floor than anything else.
So that was the principal point that I was trying to insinuate in there.
In terms of whether we're trying to get to a specific point in the 45% to 55% I clearly was not trying to give a specific point that we were targeting there.
45% to 55% we feel has been the appropriate range given that we have a higher than industry average rate base growth and higher than industry average earnings growth rate.
These things kind of ultimately balance together but for the foreseeable future we think we'll have a – we'll continue to have a higher than industry average rate base in earnings growth and so the 45% to 55% seems to still be about the right range.
Okay.
Great.
And then one other question on the productivity and financing savings.
Should I assume this is the just ongoing efforts that you guys keep having to reduce costs in the business if not kind of like one-time in nature in 2016? And thus all else equal that should continue at least until we get to the next rate case? Yes.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Our next question coming from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup.
Your line is open.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Thank you.
Hi guys.
Good afternoon.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Good afternoon.
So a quick question on growth rates and it's good to see the 7% through 2017 I guess the importance of DRP is what I'm trying to get to from the 2018 timeframe.
What I'm trying to figure out what proportion I guess of your CapEx spend will be DRP related and is there any concern that that DRP component can get pushed out or delayed in terms of CapEx spend for the next cycle? It's a darn good question.
We've said repeatedly that we think the capital expenditures are going to be in that $4 billion plus or $4-ish billion range for the foreseeable future and all I can give you until we file our 2018 GRC is a sense that part of the component that could push the spending higher is DRP but this year will be important – the balance of this year gathering from the PUC what they're thinking about the DRP we will include in our GRC an appropriate level.
And there are some other things that are pluses and minuses.
Ted mentioned it.
I had it in my script.
We've got the Charge Ready program.
It's flowing through.
That's on a separate track and we need to get through the Phase 1 before we can add the additional – potentially up to $300 million of capital expenditures for that program.
I also said we didn't have any storage-related expenditures in there.
So there's a number of things that are in the mix and when you get into a GRC you take a look at all the factors you want to make sure that your rates are appropriate that you're not putting up – pushing out the other edge for what you can afford from an affordability perspective.
So we'll take all those things into consideration and of course we're going to pass back the benefits that we've realized in the current GRC cycle and so we will have to see how all things work out.
So it's hard to predict beyond that 4-plus-ish range going forward until we actually file the GRC in September.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Got you.
Thanks Jim.
And just quickly a much more detailed question but one of the offsets I guess you mentioned the bonus depreciation with this working cash.
Can you just give us some context of what it is and how do you see that like in future years? Is that a component in like 2016 2017 as well and what's the kind of size or order of magnitude of working cash? Well that's a long answer.
But if I could simplify as a company we invest cash and it has to do with when you make ultimately payments and we have this part of the GRC if you'd like to read all about it there's a section in the GRC filing that's called the lead-lag study.
And as a result of changes as a result of bonus it affected the lead-lag study and provided essentially more rate base for us.
And I'm going to stop there unless you want the gory details which I'm going to lose my ability pretty quickly.
But if you want more details we'll be happy to take you through it after the call and we'll give you some more information.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Got you.
That'll be helpful.
Thanks Jim.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Our next question coming from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust.
Your line is open.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon Ali.
Inc.</span></strong> Hey Jim or Ted when you talk about this potential run-rate of CapEx $4 billion plus annually going forward.
If you kind of reverse that with the cash flow benefits I guess from bonus depreciation how do you look at your capacity to wrap up that CapEx before you run into say issuing new equity or before rate impacts get too big in your mindful customers? What kind of I guess cushion do you have if you had the opportunity to go above $4 billion and still not have to issue equity and still keep the rate impact? What do you think is fairly reasonable? Well.
It's a tough question.
That's really a financially modeling one.
And you have to take in other factors too.
You have to look at debt capacity at the utility how much short-term debt you could use.
You can look at debt capacity at the holding company and there are just factors that you're balancing accounts how it changes your cash.
As you know now we're fairly over collected in our balancing accounts.
So you have to look at all these things and then crank that through the model in terms of what you're trying to do in terms of capital expenditures and then how you're targeting rate base and then rate growth.
So it's a very complicated set of factors that the important thing the management team here will do between now and September is try to get all these dials just right and as we prepare for and file our 2018 GRC.
So it's not a satisfactory answer but there is just so many components to go into it.
Jr.
- Chairman President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hey Ali this is Ted.
I think one piece that we have said at various points with investors is that the high-level and without getting lost too much in any specifics for one year versus another things are in equilibrium assuming around this 50% equity debt capital structure and around a 45% to 55% dividend payout.
You're about in equilibrium when you have long-term growth in the 6% to 8% range.
You start getting much higher than that it starts getting – you need other things to help out.
And in the past when we had an extremely high growth rate when we were in that 10% to 12% we did have a number of unusual things.
That's where the global tax settlement deal really helped us out bonus depreciation and those types of things.
Absent those we would have really run too hot and we would have to issue equity.
The other part that you mentioned which I think is really worth of emphasizing again here increasingly I think the focus is to try to really hold the line on customer rates.
If we look at the long-term trajectory the history here last 20 years we've actually managed to keep customer rates at or below the rate of inflation and we definitely want to at least continue that.
If anything we'd like to be able to have rates stay flat.
But fundamentally our goal is to try to keep it more around the rate of inflation or lower.
If you get too hot a growth rate in here especially given the relatively modest growth in energy consumption you're going to really put pressure on rates.
So that becomes as much as anything else kind of the governor on what we want to have in the way of growth.
So customer rates equity long-term growth rate all of that kind of boils down to you want to focus to stay somewhere in this kind of 6% to 8% range.
Get much hotter than that you're going to have issue equity or have pressure on rates.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay very helpful.
Second question with regards to where we stand on SONGS just to understand the process now it appears we're really waiting for the ALJ decision and that sets the clock with regards to the Commission or Board et cetera.
Is that it or are anything else pending or anything else you can point to for us to try to monitor this from our vantage point? This is Adam Umanoff the General Counsel at EIX.
There really isn't anything else we can point you to.
There is a request for rehearing and their petitions for modification that are pending.
Until the ALJ rules on the petitions for modification and that goes up to the Commission and until the Commission rules on the request for rehearing there is really no other action to consider.
Inc.</span></strong> Understood.
Thank you.
Okay Ali.
Thank you.
Our next question coming from the line of Ashar Khan of Visium.
Your line is open.
Good afternoon and congrats.
Jim as I guess one thing which we are trying to fathom is everything is now trading on 2018 and if I'm correct you mentioned you will provide the 2018 rate base in September when you file the rate case but I just wanted to get a couple of things right.
So you said if you spend about $4 billion that adds to approximately like $2 billion of rate base and that should allow you to keep your 7% EPS CAGR or rate base CAGR going from 2017 to 2018.
Is that correct that's what I heard? So just a clarification the 7% CAGR was from 2015 through 2017.
Okay.
Since we don't have any other numbers out there we're just giving you the indication of $4 billion-ish is the appropriate level of capital expenditures going beyond 2017.
But $4 billion is equal to $2 billion in rate base right? That's the correct math? It is a rough rule of thumb yes.
Okay.
And secondly you also alluded to I just want to mention if I got it right is that you do expect the efficiency savings the savings that you have like $0.17 right now productivity and financing benefits you don't expect them to go to zero in 2018.
You expect there to be some level you don't know what probably not as high as $0.17 but there should be some level of those savings still there in the next rate cycle is that fair? That would be our hope.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That was the last question.
I will now turn the call back to Mr.
Cunningham.
Thanks very much everyone for participating.
And don't hesitate to call us Investor Relations if you have any follow-up questions.
Thanks and good evening.
Thank you.
And that concludes today's conference.
Thank you all for joining.
You may now disconnect.
