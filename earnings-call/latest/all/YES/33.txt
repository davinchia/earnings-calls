Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
As you've seen from our press release and as outlined on Slide 3 we had a good first quarter and we're excited about the ongoing deployment of wireless data networks.
Also during the first quarter we resumed our long-standing practice of purchasing our common shares investing approximately 30% of our first quarter 2011 recurring cash flow in this activity which we believe will enhance long-term recurring cash flow per share.
Turning to Slide 4 I'd like to highlight a few items from the first quarter.
During the first quarter we generated site rental revenue of $456 million up 12% from the first quarter of 2010.
Site rental revenue in the first quarter benefited from $6.7 million in unexpected nonrecurring items comprised primarily of the noncash impact from licenses that were expected to but did not terminate as a result of carrier consolidation and a termination fee related to a take-or-pay arrangement with the customer.
Absent these one-timers site rental revenue was at the high end of the previously issued guidance with 7% of the growth coming from new tenant activity 3% coming from the existing base of business and 2% from the aforementioned nonrecurring items.
Site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues plus the cost of operations was $338 million up 15% from the first quarter of 2010 reflecting an incremental margin of 91%.
This is the 10th straight quarter that we have achieved incremental margins of greater than 90% on our growth in site rental revenue which reflects one of the great attributes of our business as well as our continued focus on managing our costs.
Furthermore our Services business performed very well with the contribution from services gross margin increasing year-over-year by 39%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2011 was $319 million up 16% from the first quarter of 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA benefited from the aforementioned $6.7 million in nonrecurring items and $2 million due to the 11% increase in the Australian dollar to U.S.
dollar exchange rate.
As shown on Slide 5 recurring cash flow defined as adjusted EBITDA less interest expense less sustaining capital expenditures was $190 million up 27% from the first quarter of 2010 and recurring cash flow per share was $0.66 also up 27% from the first quarter of 2010.
It is important to note that these growth rates were achieved almost entirely through organic growth on assets we owned as of January 1 2010 as growth from acquisitions was negligible.
Turning to investments and liquidity as shown on Slide 6 during the first quarter we purchased approximately 42 million of our common shares and a further 10 million in April.
Since 2003 we have spent $2.4 billion to purchase approximately 94 million of our common shares and potential shares representing 1/3 of the company's shares at an average price of $25.86 per share.
Further during the first quarter we spent $52 million on capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures include $22 million on our land purchase program.
Today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath Towers representing approximately 72% of our site rental gross margin up from less than 40% in January 2007 when we completed our acquisition of Global Signal.
We continue to enjoy significant success with this program as evidenced by the fact that 35% of our U.S.
site rental gross margin is generated from Towers on land that we own up from less than 15% in January of 2007.
Further the average remaining term on our ground leases is approximately 31 years.
We also recently achieved a significant internal milestone as we completed our 10 000th land transaction.
Our internal team that works on this important effort is to be congratulated for the hard work creativity and effort that they have put in over many years to bring us to this point.
We believe that this activity has resulted in the most secured land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease exploration and we continue to believe that this is an important long-term effort that provides a long-term benefit as it protects our margins and controls our largest operating expense.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we spent $3 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $27 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures the latter consisting of $16 million on existing sites and $11 million on the construction of new sites including distributed antenna systems.
Further we've repaid $50 million of the revolving credit facility during the first quarter and an additional $15 million since April 1.
We ended the first quarter 2011 with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 5.3x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of 3.2x.
Turning to our full year 2011 outlook as shown on Slide 7 which is based on our current leasing activity our visibility in the near-term leasing activity and is consistent with recent announcements from the U.S.
wireless carriers.
We expect site rental revenue growth in 2011 of approximately $130 million comprised of approximately 2% growth in the existing base of business and 6% growth from the expected additional tenant equipment to be added to our site.
This outlook for revenue growth assumes the majority of our leasing activity comes from the two largest wireless operators in the U.S.
and a large number of relatively small wireless operators and also assumes that the leasing activity for the balance of 2011 remain similar to the activities that we saw in the first quarter.
As shown on Slide 8 we expect to generate approximately $540 million of recurring cash flow for the balance of the year and spend approximately $200 million on discretionary capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites including distributed antenna systems.
The remaining portion of the recurring cash flow ignoring our financing capacity represents approximately $340 million of cash flow for the balance of 2011 which we could invest in activities related to our core business including acquisitions and purchasing our common shares.
Consistent with our past practice our 2011 outlook does not include the benefit from expected future investments such as share purchases and tower acquisitions that we expect will enhance our long-term recurring cash flow per share.
We believe that recurring cash flow per share is the best long-term measure of shareholder value creation.
Importantly I believe that our ongoing discretionary capital investment can add between 4% and 6% to our organic recurring cash flow per share growth rate on an annual basis.
So in summary we had a good first quarter as we continue to execute around our core business and we are pleased to have resumed purchasing our common shares which we believe enhances the long-term recurring cash flow per share.
With that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
We had a strong first quarter exceeding our outlook for site rental revenue adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow.
In addition our U.S.
Services business performed very well with services revenues up 14% and services margins up 39% compared to the first quarter last year.
Further we are pleased to be back purchasing our shares which we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share.
As Jay just mentioned most of the growth we anticipate for the balance of the year is fueled primarily by the two largest U.S.
carriers upgrading 3G capacity and overlaying 4G networks.
In addition there are a number of other potential 4G deployments that we believe will create additional demand for our infrastructure although unlikely to have a material effect on our results this year.
Before I talk about potential upside opportunities I'd like to draw your attention to some of the important macro trends that continue to drive our business.
The U.S.
wireless data market grew 23% year-over-year to reach $55 billion in total mobile data service revenues in 2010 and is expected to increase another 22% to $67 billion this year.
Smartphones continue to drive wireless data revenue representing over 50% of the devices sold by all the carriers in the U.S.
in 2010 which is almost twice the global average.
As a result at the end of 2010 U.S.
smartphone penetration had reached 31% in the market compared to only 23% at the end of 2009.
While the average data consumption in the U.S.
at the end of 2010 was 350 megabytes per month many of the "super phones" introduced in the last or second half of 2010 are consuming an average of 1 to 1.5 gigabytes per month.
In fact total 2010 U.S.
mobile data traffic was more than 2.5x that of 2009.
The significant rise in smartphone sales and usage in the U.S.
market means that by the end of 2011 in the U.S.
smartphones will consume more than data cards for the first time ever.
The U.S.
is also expected to become the number 1 nation globally in mobile data consumption per capita this year.
To that end smartphone sales helped drive AT&amp;T Wireless data revenue growth 24% up nearly $1 billion year-over-year.
AT&amp;T had its largest first quarter smartphone sales ever signing 5.5 million new customers comprising both upgrades and new subscriptions.
The number of smartphones on its network increased by about 2.4 million in the quarter and 9 million in just the last 12 months.
Similarly at Verizon Wireless total data revenue grew about $1 billion year-to-year 22% year-over-year and now represents 38% of total service revenue.
A key driver of data growth in 2011 is expected to be increased penetration of smartphones in the company's retail postpaid phone base.
With new smartphone sales running above 60% of total sales at both major carriers it's clear that these devices will continue to grow from current penetration levels of only 46% at AT&amp;T and 32% at Verizon Wireless.
Further in the period of less than 8 weeks Verizon activated 2.2 million iPhones and in 2 weeks activated 60 000 of its first 4G LTE smartphone the HTC Thunderbolt.
While the U.S.
represents less than 5% of the world's population it accounts for over 20% of global data revenues.
In fact when measured by wireless data revenues Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T are 2 of the top 3 largest mobile data carriers in the world.
By the end of 2013 the U.S.
market is expected to account for 25% of all global mobile data services revenue.
Reinforcing our thesis that as the most dominant market in terms of revenue generation for the wireless industry the U.S.
is globally the most attractive market to capture growth in wireless services and ultimately drive our business.
These statistics are why we remain focused on the U.S.
market the largest fastest growing and most profitable wireless market in the world by nearly every measure.
With the demand for data services concentrated disproportionately in the major cities we are best positioned to capture this opportunity with the highest concentration of sites among our peers in the top 100 U.S.
markets.
Moving on where we would expect to see the impact of this activity on our business as we mentioned most of the activity to date this year has been from AT&amp;T and Verizon.
As you are aware in March AT&amp;T announced their intent to acquire T-Mobile USA.
The proposed acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&amp;T is expected to increase AT&amp;T's incremental infrastructure investment in the U.S.
by more than $8 billion over the next 7 years.
AT&amp;T is committed to a significant expansion of a robust 4G LTE deployment 294 million POPs or 95% of the total U.S.
population reaching an additional 46 million Americans beyond their current plans.
We are seeing the benefits of the aggressive LTE rollout and other network enhancements underway at AT&amp;T this year.
The company is planning to commercially launch service midyear and plans to cover 70 to 75 million POPs by the end of the year.
Similarly Verizon's initial LTE launch last December which included 38 markets carrying 110 million POPs they have announced a further expansion of the company's LTE footprint to include more than 100 additional markets.
By the end of the year Verizon plans to be in about 175 markets covering more than 185 million POPs and we are seeing significant activity toward that end.
In addition as part of their Network Vision plan Sprint intends to repurpose some of their 800-megahertz spectrum for CDMA service but expectations for the first upgraded cell sites to go live with the new equipment in 8 of the largest metro areas beginning in the fall of 2011.
The capital expenditures related to Network Vision at Sprint are expected to ramp up in the second half of 2011 with the highest levels of capital investment taking place in 2012 and 2013.
With regards to some of the new emerging carriers there have been several announcements since the last quarter.
Sprint and Clearwire recently came into an agreement over wholesale pricing.
Under the new deal Clearwire will receive at least $1 billion from Sprint in 2011 and '12.
Further LightSquared has signed a long-term LTE roaming deal with Leap notching its first major wireless operator wholesale partner shortly after it announced a similar deal of open-range communications.
The 2 companies said the deal will allow Leap to supplement LTE coverage it plans to deploy with roaming on LightSquared's network.
Finally President Obama's budget included $10.7 billion to include a nationwide wireless network for emergency responders and $5 billion to help Americans get mobile access to high-speed Internet service.
While it appears the buildout activity of Sprint Clearwire LightSquared and those that benefit from the federal government investment is unlikely have a meaningful impact on our 2011 financial results we anticipate beginning to see the impact in 2012 and beyond and expect that our assets will be instrumental in facilitating these and other network deployments in whatever form they should take.
We are obviously very pleased with our results and believe they demonstrate the quality of our assets combined with our ability to execute for our customers.
As always we remain disciplined and focused on maximizing long-term recurring cash flow per share through opportunistic investments such as share repurchases as viable alternatives to acquisitions.
And at a macro level we're incredibly excited about the trends we are seeing in wireless and are positioned to capture value from those trends.
So to summarize we are focused on the U.S.
market where the ability of the wireless carriers to make profitable investments is most apparent and barriers to entry for our business remain high.
We have the best located assets in the industry with significantly more towers in the top 100 market than any of our peers and our customer surveys continue to indicate that we are a highly regarded partner and enjoy the highest level of customer satisfaction in the industry.
So in closing we had a strong first quarter and are excited about our future and I'd like to add my congratulations to the team on their 10 000th land transaction which is almost hard to even contemplate.
With that operator I'd be happy to turn the call over for questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
LLC</strong> Got some questions.
First of all the one-time impacts that you identified for first quarter the take-or-pay contract and the noncash impacts related to licenses is there any of that that you're accepting for second quarter or later in the year? And then just paint [ph] a picture perhaps for Ben the impacts that you would anticipate to see when the actual consolidation work happens on the network between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are you expecting that -- or how should you expect that to be similar to or different from what you saw with the Cingular and AT&amp;T? John an answer to the first question in any given quarter we would typically expect to see between $1.5 million and $2 million of one-time items so I think in each of the quarters for the balance of the year you would expect to see that and we've seen that in every quarter going backwards.
So the items we're calling out here would be really in addition to anything we would normally see and there's nothing in those items that we would expect to recur in future quarters.
With regard to the consolidation between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile obviously it's not even early days.
The transaction is just now being considered.
But as we previously disclosed our AT&amp;T licenses have an average of about 12 years to run and T-Mobile similarly 7 years to run and the overlap in terms of the revenue exposure if you will where T-Mobile coexists or is co-located on an AT&amp;T site if it's installed is around 6% of our total revenue.
So John our experience in the past with consolidation has been that we see significantly less churn than the overlap that exists and that's been consistent in every consolidating transaction to date.
I wouldn't venture a guess to say other than we would expect it to be something less than 6% but at this point it's just -- at this point I think it's beneficial for us to get the facts out for you guys for everybody to appreciate the exposures and what our history has been again less than 100% significantly less typically than churn on an overlap site but we'll have to see how that works itself out over the coming years.
Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Ben I think you talked about Sprint and some of their Network Vision plans as well as potentially network sharing.
Can you just update us on where -- what the sort of amendment activity might be? Is this a little bit like the 3Q to 4Q that we've seen at the big 2 and where does the sort of decommissioning of items fit into that? Have you sort of squared away the contract amendments there and what the status is on that? And then one for Jay the leverage is ticking down 5.3 it could be dipping below 5 is that -- are you comfortable in the 4's or would you rather continue to reinvest and keep it up in the sort of mid-to high-5s over time? Simon let me address Sprint a little bit.
We're certainly not going to get out in front of our customer Sprint particularly on their call this morning where they were addressing their plans on Network Vision.
We are enthusiastic supporters of them and as I go through their process of wanting to repurpose some spectrum and upgrade their equipment we expect to be a valued partner with them.
I'm not going to really get into exactly where we are in the negotiations back and forth but as I have said we're in active dialogue with them and to the extent they wanted to share and host someone else on their spectrum or using someone else's spectrum to host on their network.
There's a way we can accomplish that and I think it's something that we would be constructive on and we'd find something that would be mutually beneficial that would get more spectrum deployed in a very efficient manner.
And so I'm very confident that if that's where they want to take their objectives.
We can accommodate that and it will be in our mutual best interest to do so.
Simon on your second question around leverage and I think we've been pretty vocal about the fact that in terms of the leverage target we would expect to operate the business from those space [ph] somewhere between 4x and 6x debt-to-EBITDA.
Really I would say at a target of about 5x is where most of the time we'll operate the business and you're right we're nearing that 5x leverage level.
I think as you see us finish this year and go into next year I would expect that you'll see us begin to maintain about a 5x leverage ratio in the business.
So if we were to grow adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis over the years starting in 2012 somewhere in the neighborhood of $80 million to $100 million which has been sort of our baseline level of growth that we've talked to you about over a long period of time take a midpoint there of about $90 million of adjusted EBITDA growth that would generate about $450 million of capital to invest in the business.
And when you combine that with -- as I made the comments about our level of discretionary capital investment that we have beyond the normal CapEx that we're doing in the business approaching a number that's $900 million to $1 billion of capital to invest in and around the core business as we go forward and that really goes right to my point in my prepared comments about -- I believe that the level of capital investment that we can do around the core assets be that acquisitions or the repurchase of our own common stock at somewhere between 400 and 600 basis points to our organic growth rate when you combine that with all of the activity that we believe we'll see top line growth from leasing activity.
Great that's very helpful.
Thanks Jay.
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
I guess I just want to follow up quickly on the last one.
If the target range is 4 to 6 you had an opportunity this year with the stock being weak on a couple of events.
I think a lot of people assume that 6 could be accomplished through a leveraging event that presumably was going to be attached to a deal and most people would have pinned that to T-Mo towers.
I'm just wondering with those off the block now why don't you sort of look at the stock and say this is attractive enough to push us to the higher end of our leverage target just to accelerate buybacks? And I guess second question is just on EBITDA guidance that you sort of left at its existing level despite a pretty big 1Q number and if you look at 2Q and sort of take the midpoint there what you're implying for the yearly EBITDA guidance is declines in 3Q and 4Q and even at the midpoint you're still implying declines which and I guess given your commentary given industry commentary just seems pretty far-fetched.
So why not take that off the table at this point? Jason I think an answer to your first question.
As we think about managing the balance sheet we think about managing it over a long period of time and a lot of people have asked the exact question that you asked around would we take the opportunity to lever up in order to make an acquisition and I think that's certainly an opportunity.
But the range is there intentionally to give us flexibility as the cost of debt moves the opportunity moves around both assets and where our stock is trading and our view on that and so I would leave the flexibility that is intentional in the range that we've given and wouldn't necessarily assume that we would only borrow to make an acquisition.
I think we've been pretty consistent over a long period of time describing the fact that we think of our own shares as the buyback of our own towers.
It's really just a tower acquisition and no different than buying third-party towers.
So I would leave the range in place as I've described it and I think you'll see us manage that over time.
With regards to your second question and looking at sequential moves in quarterly revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the balance of the year there's obviously a number of things kind of moving in there that make us maybe a little more difficult than the normal easy quarter to look at our results.
We try to call out the one-time items which in essence brings down kind of where we came out in the first quarter and it becomes the base upon which we build for the balance of the calendar year.
Second thing I would note is that in the second half of the year our FX assumption is 0.9 rather than 1.0 exchange ratio Australian dollar to U.S.
dollar and that's about $2 million in each of those subsequent quarters.
So to some degree that creates a leveling in the back half of the year.
And then the last thing I would mention about this is as we give this outlook and affirm the outlook that we gave beginning in the third quarter of 2010 for our full year 2011 it assumes that the leasing activity for the balance of this calendar year looks similar to what we saw in the first quarter of 2011 and I think for all of the comments that both Ben and I made in our prepared remarks we'd suggest that there are potentially more additional tenants coming in the late part of this year or into next year.
As Sprint talked about on their call this morning Network Vision appears to be a fourth-quarter late-2011 event and frankly if that's when the activity occurs we really won't see the benefits of that in site rental revenues until those leases or amendments are on air and paying rent which in all likelihood means we won't see the benefit of that until the first quarter of 2012.
So I think at this point it's based on what we're seeing and I think it's consistent with what the carriers are seeing and at the same time it may look a little light going into the back half of the year.
We're pretty excited about what it means headed into 2012.
Okay thanks Jay.
Our next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital.
Two if I could.
First of all on DAS you highlighted in the release it's a pretty interesting area and I wonder if you can talk about what portion thus far of the CapEx say in this quarter recently has been DAS-related and how do you see that evolving over time? And also if you can talk about what sort of economics or returns you're seeing on the CapEx sort of playing toward DAS deployments versus more traditional towers? And secondly just to make sure I understood wouldn't the change in the rate of the Aussie dollar versus U.S.
for the back half of the year all else being equal raise second half guidance? You want to [indiscernible]? Yes it's the other way.
We lowered the assumption so if we were to keep it at current levels revenue growth would look higher.
So we're stepping it down from actual first quarter which was [ph]...
Okay okay so you're going to -- right understood thanks.
On your question James on DAS we remain enthusiastic.
We see a growing pipeline of opportunity there.
This year our sort of internal forecast on spending is in and around $50 million of CapEx.
We are roughly on pace for that.
I think that probably builds to the back half of this year but we're quite pleased with a growing pipeline there of what we think are very interesting opportunities to provide sort of nontraditional coverage and capacity in areas that are challenged today both in terms of outdoor DAS opportunities and indoor venue opportunities as well and so we intend to continue to pursue that as much as we possibly can.
But as I've said on these calls before it's not a significant component of our business thus far just because the size and run rate of the core business is so large but we think it can potentially add a percent to our revenue growth over time and a very attractive usage of capital in terms of accretive investments.
It also fulfills a customer need that's out there that provides more of a total solution that we can offer customers.
So it's something we're excited and enthusiastic about.
We're going to continue it.
I don't think you'll see it being a hugely material contributor to the financial results but certainly at the margin it's accretive and positive.
Great thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.</strong> A couple of questions for you.
One back on the Aussie exchange rate versus guidance.
Is that revenue and EBITDA are about the same $2 million per quarter or was that a revenue number? I gave you a revenue number.
The EBITDA number would be about 80% of that.
Inc.</strong> Right okay.
And actually as we look at second quarter to date it's actually been running over 1.0.
We're almost approaching 1.1 so it would obviously -- the account [ph] could be even more upside possibly on the currency basis.
Exactly right.
Yes.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
Second question and I'm not supposed to [ph] put you in a box on what Sprint was saying this morning but if Sprint is going to launch 8 markets in the fourth quarter wouldn't they have to be doing some work on the towers before that? Why would they be doing work after that? Yes I think that's a reasonable assumption Rick.
I think you'll see if their plans ultimately come through the year as they expect and we'll certainly be a contributing factor in that I think you'll see activity this summer related to that initial work on those sites and those markets that'll need to get launched by the end of the year but again not a material revenue event for us for the year.
If you look at the fact that those licenses would come on sort of in the back half of the year and build towards 2012 it's not going to result in a significant revenue uplift for us this year.
As we go forward where ultimately their plans are to touch all their CDMA sites over the next 3 years it can be significant and we expect it to be significant and material to our contribution towards growth in years 2012 to 2014.
So it's one of the reasons we're very enthusiastic about the future 2012 to 2014 around Network Vision in and of itself and in all the other spectrum that's out there that ultimately will get launched and as I said in my prepared remarks in whatever form that may take.
Sprint has talked about prospectively hosting others on their network and using their equipment.
As I said that's something we can support and so I'm quite encouraged by Network Vision as it's currently defined and then if and when they decide to ultimately bring forward a share on that network we will be constructive and participate there and I think that adds further growth to the outlook for 2012 to '14.
But I do want to reiterate as we go through and we said in our remarks those are sort of end of '11 sort of 2012 '13 and 14.
This year what we're primarily seeing is a very aggressive upgrade of 3G and 4G out of AT&amp;T and Verizon.
So from our perspective and we never speak for our customers but from our perspective it appears that they are doing everything that they possibly can to meet their objectives around the LTE launches and increasing even 3G capacity on their network and there's a lot of activity going on.
But I think the rest of the marketplace is poised to really be sort of a as I've described in this long-winded answer really poised to be a 2012 '13 and '14 growth expectation that's sort of built into our enthusiasm long-term.
Inc.</strong> Makes sense.
Just as the Street being a very forward-looking animal just want to make sure that Sprint hasn't made their decision yet or haven't made their announcement yet so we get that middle of the year and then we see some services business some design work kicking into third quarter maybe we see some leasing activity that we haven't seen so far this year coming into the fourth quarter.
But as far as an annual effect as far as seeing a demonstrable number in 2011 it's not really there but fourth quarter could show some revenue.
Yes that'd be our expectation and certainly we have high expectations around the services piece as well.
Inc.</strong> That makes sense.
Again one more quick and I apologize.
A lot of discussion of what's going to happen in Sprint Vision.
Sprint at several meetings we've had with them at CTIA [Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association] our institutional conference has talked extensively about moving the radio up to the top of the tower having a radio head per frequency a lot of discussion from Sprint on moving towards the Clearwire method of backhaul being very heavily microwave-driven.
And as you look at the net-net of stuff going from the bottom of the tower to the top of the tower maybe fiber instead of co-ax [coaxial] what's the net-net effect of using less stuff at the bottom less stuff maybe up the tower and then a lot more stuff on the top of the tower do you think not to say in Sprint but just in general and in contract? Well I think where you're ultimately heading Rick is into specific application pricing which is a difficult place for us to go.
We're not going to really talk about that.
But our expectation is what we've seen is that the loading is not significantly different.
The RRUs [Radio Remote Unit] that go up the tower are not insignificant they do wait quite a bit and so almost for what you take off on co-ax you add higher on the tower in terms of loading.
So there's not I would say a material change in loading on the tower just because you're reconfiguring the electronics.
In fact in some cases it's actually increasing the loading on the site.
But I think it's very early days and we'll just have to wait and see how that shakes out over time.
Inc.</strong> Okay thanks.
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Guggenheim Partners.
LLC</strong> Couple of questions.
With regard to DAS I think you mentioned a few minutes ago that it might add 1% I think you said to revenue.
Can you help us understand a little bit about with regard to investment versus return on invested capital long-term? I mean how important can DAS be incrementally as you move forward? And then secondly with regard to tower builds and acquisitions obviously I think there was a net to additions in the first quarter.
How should we be thinking about the last 3 quarters of the year? Last year I think there was a net negative of around 100 towers or so.
Can you give us just some thoughts on that? Sure Michael.
On the DAS activity we are finding today that at the levels that we're attempting to succeed in and around $50 million this year of spend to the extent we can grow that over time we certainly will.
So over a long period of time we have high aspirations for multi-thousands of nodes and maybe potentially a couple of hundred [million dollars] $300 million of investment over time.
I mean it's hard to say it is so very early days in the DAS pipeline building because with every passing month as capacity challenges increase we're seeing more areas more venues becoming DAS candidates and more and more carrier interest in covering those whereas previously a year or two ago there was just not that same level of demand or expectation on the part of us as consumers frankly to have that level of service in all those areas.
So the real answer to your question of how big can this be is we don't know.
We are going to pursue it as rapidly as we can.
We find these to be accretive investments.
Just because it's small does not mean we don't actively go after something.
I think if that were your litmus test it'd be hard to sort of get up every day because the company today generating in over $1.2 billion in EBITDA you could quickly conclude well in almost anything it's in isolation immaterial.
But you got to start somewhere and we're pretty enthusiastic about what we see as it being a contributor to accretive investment over time.
With regards to your second question about tower count following the Global Signal acquisition that we did back at the beginning of 2007 we went through a process of really reviewing sites that had negative margin on them and I believe we've gone through most of the process where we've taken down or removed towers from the portfolio.
So I wouldn't expect that you'll see the levels of decommissioning of sites that we did during 2009 and 2010.
We'll probably have a little bit of that going forward.
But really I think more importantly if you're trying to figure out what the tower count is going to be in the future it's dependent upon acquisitions and as I mentioned in my prior comments we value and evaluate those acquisitions against the alternative which is buying our own towers in stock purchases.
So almost impossible for me to predict where that will come out but at least on the decommissioning side we'd expect that would be lower than what you've seen over the last couple of years.
LLC</strong> Okay great.
And one final thing I'm just trying to get my arms around.
With the rapid growth obviously at mobile wireless data how is that impacting the equipment that is being placed on your towers and is that impacting the way you price the space sort of throughput on your towers going forward? Not really sure I understand your question but generally what's happening is what has happened in really all of the overlays that we've had life-to-date which is carriers adding additional lines and the antenna and equipment on the sites for which we're charging for additional capacity that they're consuming on the site whether it be up the tower or ground space.
So the basic pricing construct has not changed and the basic need to add additional lines and antennas and equipment on the site remains intact.
LLC</strong> Okay thank you very much.
Our next question comes from the line of Clay Moran with Benchmark.
LLC</strong> Since we're talking about the DAS I know you said it's pretty small but can you quantify the actual percent of revenue today? And then do you include rooftop in DAS and if not is there a contribution from rooftop? I really don't recall.
And what's the growth rate on the rooftop? And then secondly another follow-up detail type question but on the AT&amp;T-Cingular merger can you remind us in detail what the actual decommissioning percentage was of the overlap sites? Sure.
Clay its Ben.
On DAS I would say we really haven't disclosed kind of the run rate.
It is immaterial to the $1.8 billion run rate of the tower business today.
Again what we're focused on is the growth year-over-year and have aspirations of it being hopefully about 1% of revenue growth and that means you're building individual nodes.
That means you've got to go some to get that level of growth.
That's a lot of individual contribution from construction.
So that's probably as much detail as I can provide you on that.
Rooftops are not included in that and are pretty much wholly insignificant to our overall run rate today.
May grow over time but for now they are basically wholly insignificant I mean really a gnat really in our overall run rate.
Clay your third question around the AT&amp;T-Cingular merger that happened a number of years ago and what ultimately we saw there I'll just put a little bit of a disclaimer on this.
It's been mentioned to you that we obviously have disclaimed [ph] a merger did [ph] on the Global Signal sites which doubled the number of sites that we have in the U.S.
But as best we can tell going back and looking at the analysis and obviously the equipment changes and amendments happen over time so it's not a perfectly static measure as you look at what overlap looked like at the time of the announcement and then ultimately what they did on their sites but we believe that number to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 30% or thereabouts of the initial overlap activities that they had on those sites when they announced the merger and what they ultimately took off of them.
But again there's a couple of ins and outs there that would probably make that number could even look a little better than that.
And then the last thing I would mention about it which I think we've talked a lot about following the announcement is that when we go back and look at the activity that we saw from AT&amp;T and Cingular as standalone parties prior to the merger the amount of leasing that those 2 firms were doing independently was much less than the level of activity that we saw once they were combined.
And so -- and I've reconciled for you I think the decommissioning side.
I think an important other side of that is the activity we saw on the positive in terms of gross ads [ph] was much greater than what we saw when the 2 companies were separate and I think that really goes the hardest then mentioned of the additional $8 billion of capital investment because AT&amp;T has talked about following their acquisition of T-Mobile or announced acquisition of T-Mobile.
And that would be pretty consistent with what we've seen not only with that merger but with other consolidations in the past among the carriers.
LLC</strong> Okay thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.
You talked a little bit about DAS and you would ramp up the spending on that if you were able.
But can you talk about your ability just to ramp CapEx from here? We have a lot of ability to spend money and T-Mobile I know is going out and doing some things in the rural side or regional side.
Is there an ability to sort of ramp up the number of builds out there or are you sort of running at the highest possible rate that makes sense already? Yes Phil I think as we look at capital spending and again when I think of capital spending we start with tower augmentations or to put it even more simply tenant improvements if you will on augmenting existing towers to accommodate additional run rate revenue and that's sort of the first thing we spend money on in the company and the highest returning activity available to us.
And we've talked about that for years typically a less than a year payback on average.
Next we come onto land as we've talked about at length and as Jay mentioned in his comments and have aspirations maybe this year to spend somewhere in the 100 to 120 range and we’ll just have to see again how that goes along.
We spent in over 20 this quarter alone.
And then in terms of acquisitions we'll continue to look at acquisitions and they're hard to predict.
There are some small transactions out there.
Some of them look reasonable some of them don't honestly looking at our relative value and the opportunities to buy shares.
And so when we think about capital deployed it really all goes into one pot which we sort of think about in terms of opportunity cost.
And the way we operate the business is that every dollar is spoken for and will be spent and our objective everyday is to maximize the outcome of that measured by recurring cash flow per share as Jay was mentioning.
So as Jay talked about $340 million the balance of this year that's unspoken for I would say that we'll continue to do what we've been doing which is doing our best to put that to the highest and best returning activity.
That will likely be some acquisitions and it'll likely be some more share repurchases and we think about this as a marathon not a sprint so it's an ongoing process of deploying the capital quarter-to-quarter.
And next year as Jay mentioned if we get down to sort of that 5x area on leverage that capacity doubles gets close to $1 billion so it'll be an ongoing activity to put something like in and around $250 million a quarter to work.
I think it's fair to say Phil that if you're trying to think about the cash flow statement for the balance of the year I think it's unlikely that we can spend much more than about $250 million of CapEx for the balance of the year in terms of CapEx.
The other items would be as I mentioned acquisition -- hits you on the acquisition line or on a purchase of common shares.
But don't expect that capital number's going to move much beyond what we showed in the first quarter.
Okay.
And then can you just give us some a little more for the industry view overall but what percent of your towers at this point are wired with fiber? And is that accelerating right now or do you expect that -- what do you expect it to do over the year? Phil it is absolutely accelerating.
Fiber to sites is ongoing and very active.
I don't have a way of really reconciling for you exactly how many of our sites are fibered today.
I'll be venturing and [ph] guess that something over half but I can't tell you precisely.
But it's a very active process.
It's something that we are assisting customers with from the services side actively and so I would expect that over the next 2 or 3 years it approaches probably 90% but that's probably as precise as I can be today.
Okay.
Thanks guys.
Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.
First I'm just wondering in terms of the conversations that are going on out there we've been hearing about potential negotiations around further MLAs similar to what you had done last year and I was wondering if you could give us any color there? And then secondly on Sprint's Network Vision understanding all the puts and takes of the equipment that would be deployed it seems like it could actually create some space for you on the ground.
It may take up some space on the tower.
I'm just trying to understand how that impacts your capacity from a tower perspective.
Where are you more capacity-constrained? Where do you generally have to spend the money on augmentations? Sure Jonathan.
First of all with respect to prospective MLA negotiations or what we may enter into going forward I'd really not going to comment on that.
That's probably it on that one.
On Network Vision in terms of capacity I think the capacity question is a good one.
It's one we're happy to address with folks.
It goes to the previous answer where we talked about tenant improvement dollars or augmentation.
It is almost never an occurrence where we are completely capacity-constrained on a site where we cannot accommodate additional tenancy be it an upgrade or an additional full array or whether that'd be on the tower or ground space.
The Network Vision equipment is efficient so it's not going to consume a lot more ground space which is nice but capacity is really not something that we are running out of around here and we can create it with this additional cash capital investment tower augmentation effort that goes on here.
And so if I think of the constraints in the business capacity is not one of them.
Great.
Maybe if I can get one more in here.
As we think about the puts and takes of equipment that goes up and down on the towers as network architecture evolves should we think about the way that you price in terms of total weight drag cabling ground space as the determinant of pricing or are there some other elements that also close in there that would prevent any kind of downward pressure on what you're getting from your customers? Well ultimately I mean typically the easiest way to think about our pricing is physical and that's where we normally take the conversation with investors because that's the easiest way to think about it physical lines and antennas and loading on sites.
And there's nothing that we see in terms of architecture today that the carriers are asking to put up that lessens that load.
And so we think that constructive [ph] purpose of understanding and explaining the business is probably the easiest way to go.
But it's also true that what we are pricing is access to height vertical height and an existing site that are tough to come by today in terms of zoning.
And so while it's easy to think about it as a physical right we are certainly pricing something that's a competitive -- in terms of lack of competitive alternatives that is providing height to coverage general geography.
And so that is absolutely implicit in the negotiation and I believe certainly provides some downward floor control on pricing to the extent you would see equipment sort of unloaded.
But that's not been our experience.
I think it's still the most instructive for everyone to think about this business as physical pricing but certainly there's an element of access to these sites that is implicit in the pricing and frankly never changes.
Thank you very much.
Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.
Just a follow-up on your comment about carrier activity.
When we look at AT&amp;T's wireless CapEx it actually started off lower than what we're looking for and suggests that it's going to ramp up very nicely throughout the year and probably double for 4Q.
So when you look at carrier activity from them do you still expect it to be linear across each quarter or do you think that there could be upside in the second quarter -- in the second half? And I just wanted to follow up on Sprint comments.
You've mentioned a lot Network Vision but if we get a network hosting deal spectrum hosting deal in the couple of weeks how quickly do you think that we'll see some impact on that in your results? I think the answer to your first question around AT&amp;T there may be some puts and takes as we go through the year but I think on balance we think it's pretty level to the level of activity that we saw on the first quarter which as Ben and I both mentioned was the significant amount of activity from them.
On Sprint I just -- I'm going to let them obviously announce if they choose to proceed with a hosting arrangement with a customer.
As I've said we're constructive in that dialogue.
There is a way for that to occur.
It will result in additional revenue for us but I'm just not going to get into anything any further than that.
It's really up to them to decide how they want to utilize their network and leverage it with another spectrum owner but it's something that I think we're constructive on and to the extent it expedites spectrum being launched that wasn't previously launched and it gets that network on the air and available to consumers that is long-term positive for us and that's how we're looking at it.
Okay great.
Thanks.
Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
A few very very quick ones here.
First you talked about how if your expectations of the amount of business you saw in the first quarter would persist throughout the year if that actually comes to fruition how would 2011 and up comparing the 2010 would end up being an up down or a flat year? It would be down in terms of level of activity from 2010.
A rough order of magnitude is it a little down 10%? 15% to 20% in terms of level of activity and then I would say as we think about 2012 it looks like back up to a level of activity that we saw in 2010.
Okay.
And then could you just remind us about the seasonality in the Services business? Usually when the weather gets better the activity increases.
Does that mean that we should expect to see higher levels in 2Q and into 3Q? Typically where we most often see seasonality is in the operating expenses around repairs and maintenance and typically as you saw both in sustaining capital expenditures were just sits there as well as in the operating expense line.
We spent less than the first quarter than we do in subsequent quarters and our outlook would suggest that to be the case.
Order of magnitude $1.5 million to $2 million in the sustaining capital expenditures line higher than what we saw on the first quarter and then on the operating expense line $1.5 million to $2.5 million roughly in subsequent periods.
And one last quick one here.
We had a lot of noise about light radio a couple of months ago.
Have you actually seen any deployments to that or interest in deploying that on your towers? No.
But Brett I want to go back to first just your question about activity.
If you look at -- I think it's important activity levels this year again dominated as we said earlier around upgrade activities around AT&amp;T and Verizon.
That is yielding without investments in the guidance about 11% year-over-year recurring cash flow growth with investment spending the $340 million.
You get into the mid-teens area of recurring cash flow per share growth which we're quite comfortable with and quite pleased with.
Before you even get into sort of the 2012 to '14 timeline of all this other spectrum being deployed or equipment repurposed.
So we're actually feeling pretty comfortable at a level of activity this year which may not approach where we were last year.
We're still seeing very healthy levels of growth in terms of cash flow per share and we see lots of opportunity.
Great thanks for taking the questions.
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
Just wanted to follow up with -- just some questions around all the data demand that you guys have described.
I think the big question is trying to translate all these qualitative positives people using more data more broadband more devices and trying to figure out what it means for cell site deployments.
And I think what we're seeing with a lot of growth off a very low base over the last couple of years you see the larger carriers some consistency.
And I'm wondering from your perspective do we hit a point where the growth continues and then all of a sudden there's just a catch-up that carriers have to do to deploy more sites or is just going to be more linear? And how should we think about that? Obviously you guys get to see a lot of the granularity on this every day but from a high level what should be the right expectation for investors on how to translate all of this improvement you're increasing data usage into the site deployments? Michael that is the absolute question.
And as we see it today I think the first distinction I would draw for you and for those who have been around a long time like yourself maybe this is a little bit obvious but I would draw a distinction between a brand-new network being built where none existed prior with brand-new installations on towers is obviously being the most near-term impactful over to the extent you would look at the -- in the first half of the Clearwire build to a large degree over the last 3 or 4 years has been that type of a deployment and has had very significant contribution to incremental growth around here and I would venture to speculate our peer companies as well.
Beyond that as we've talked about this year you have a tremendous amount of work going on that are largely amendments that add up to be real money and a lot of activity around established networks that are already on the air being as we've talked about on this call AT&amp;T and Verizon primarily.
T-Mobile as well in prior years and continuing this year not to the same level of contribution but certainly adding up doing the 3G overlay and ultimately the HSPA Plus upgrade that they have been ongoing.
So the 2 distinctions are really whether you're talking about amendments on existing sites versus brand-new builds and then once you get past that the way we think about it is infill locations from cell splitting.
So we expect and we've been told by pretty much all our customers that you should expect to see more cell splitting over time after these initial wave of upgrades occur such that as the original 3G network all got built out we saw more cell splitting and more adds over time.
You should expect to see the same in coming years with 4G as the capacity is ultimately constrained because we're all using it in ways we hadn't contemplated before with new devices.
You'll see more cell splitting which again is essentially like a new add but that's longer-term and harder to forecast as we sit here today still on the very very early days of 4G deployment.
And so I can't be more precise than that.
I guess the tangential benefit you see would be in the DAS business that we're talking about where 3 years ago we couldn't sell DAS or very very rarely could we get anyone to return our phone calls on the DAS business and today we have a very robust and growing pipeline.
Again not that financially material today but a whole new line of business with nontraditional deployments that weren't available to us 3 years ago.
And I think it really the way I would sum it up in terms of financial modeling is it just gives you more certainty around the continuation of growth that is hard to be a lot more specific about.
But Jay do you want to add anything to that or...? No I think that's what I would say too Michael.
My experience is having been here for 11 years is that we always kind of look for an inflection points and people are searching for the point in which the carriers need to significantly increase their capital spend and why they might do that is either based on growth on subscribers or penetration levels or increases in usage.
The carriers I think are making the same allocation and balancing of investment of cash flow that we make as a company.
And they're balancing the return of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases much like what we do in the level of CapEx.
And our experience has been as Ben mentioned it's likely to result in more years of additional growth and leasing activities rather than seeing a big inflection point in the next 1 or 2 years and then a tailing off of that activity.
I think we're more likely to see a balanced level of capital spend and therefore a balanced level of leasing activity in our business.
That's very helpful.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
I got about 7 or 8 follow-ups on DAS.
Basically just 3 if I could.
Number 1 you said that TNV [ph] are really the big drivers here today.
T-Mobile before the AT&amp;T merger announcement really laid out a game plan where it sounded like they were going to start to spend in a way that more consistent than they had in the past.
I was wondering if you could kind of just give us a sense as to whether you think that their plan is to live up to that goal or whether they're kind of being a little bit more squishy now that the AT&amp;T deal has been announced.
I guess the second one is we talked a lot about this this Sprint Network Vision thing that they're trying to work on but I guess -- they're partners in this.
Clearwire and LightSquared are going to have some questionable financial strengths looking ahead and how do you guys protect yourselves from a credit standpoint and from a longevity standpoint when you're talking about this topic with Sprint? And then I guess the last thing would be and we also talked about leverage.
The big question here for a little window there we were thinking that the T-Mobile Power portfolio might be coming up.
There was an expectation that everybody would be buckling down and try to de-lever and get ready to make an aggressive bid.
As you guys are thinking about your capital allocations is that gone? Is that just off the table now and you're going to make decisions on what you can see right now? Or are you going to hold back a little bit just in case that comes back on the table? Yes.
In terms of the T-Mobile towers we're operating in the assumption as we've been told that they are gone for the medium term.
Assuming that the transaction closes as described obviously that'll be an AT&amp;T decision.
They own a bunch of their own towers and I think it'll be a longer-term strategic discussion that they'll want to have internally but for the purposes of planning today we're assuming they're off the table.
With your Sprint and Clearwire-LightSquared prospective credit question we would look at the counter-party who's asking.
And so this is hypothetical but to the extent that Sprint would come and want to gain rights under their licenses on our towers we would consider them to be the counter-party.
So that perhaps that answers your question.
Yes.
T-Mobile I would -- Jay you want to suggest what's happening with T-Mobile? Yes I think we're seeing levels of activity that are similar to what we were expecting when we went into the year and obviously when we set forth our outlook in the third quarter of the previous year the carriers having gone through the budgeting process.
So we never for any carrier hit that number spot on but it's in and around the levels that we would expect.
And I think to the second part of your question about what are they going to do going forward I think you're probably going to really have to ask them about what their plans are heading into the expected consolidation there but the level of activity in our outlook is similar to what we thought.
Alright great.
Thanks guys.
Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.
LLC</strong> I just had a couple of quick questions.
Really just want to follow up on a prior question in terms of leasing activity.
Is the lower leasing activity that you see in 2011 is that in part a function of the AT&amp;T master lease agreement that you did in Q3 of 2010 which essentially booked some amendment revenue early or is it simply that carriers are doing less in cell site deployments and amendments? Gray let me take that first part [ph].
As we said on the third quarter call and the fourth quarter call we haven't disclosed the identity of the party that we did that agreement with.
I really can't comment on that.
But that agreement in existence is not actually a material portion of what we're talking about in terms of leasing growth.
It really comes down to this and this is not -- for those of you that are close to the industry and follow this carefully it really shouldn't be -- it comes as much of a surprise when we say that most of the activity we're seeing this year is from AT&amp;T and Verizon amendments.
That's a fact.
If you go down the list of everybody else you can come up with a story as to generally what's going on in those networks some of them are not completely capitalized for further build-outs yet.
We're not sure what the form of those further network builds are going to actually take and then you have a lot of other spectrum that is yet to be deployed.
You've got T-Mobile which Jay just commented on which is continuing to be active but not in a significant contribution level to our overall total but certainly in line with kind of what our expectations were for the year.
And so when you look at a year like that this is sort of the outlook that you get.
It reminds me of questions that we always get when we put out annual guidance where the questions are typically what of these new sort of insurgent carriers did you've forecast in your guidance? And our answer typically has been "very little if any." That is true and that is why you see us basically looking at a year that's sort of on plan in terms of guidance because you don't see a lot of activity that would be financially impactful this year and this calendar year around those other carriers.
I think there's a lot of opportunity and activity that is going to come as back to Rick's question earlier that you'll see ramping in the fourth quarter of this year on into -- frankly gives us a lot of confidence over the next 3 years of growth to extend that growth runway.
But this year when you think back to those questions what did you put in your guidance around this other type of speculative growth the answer being "very little to none" and frankly that's kind of what we're seeing.
LLC</strong> Fair enough.
That makes a lot of sense that's very helpful.
And then just to switch topics I mean what would you say is a typical search ring for a carrier and what percentage of your towers have competitive offerings within that range? Typically if you're looking at the major metro areas the search rings are going to be very very small 1/8 of a mile 1/4 of a mile something like that.
And then competitive structures really depends on what carrier is looking at it and where their other sites are located but I would say in general the number of competitive sites whenever you're looking at a delivery of search rings would be somewhere in the 5% to 10% range in those cases.
LLC</strong> Got it.
Okay that's very helpful thank you very much.
Our last question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
I know you've kind of touched on this quite a bit but on the stock buybacks just doing the map on what you guys are saying you can buy back anywhere between 2% and kind of 10% of your shares outstanding.
Can you maybe give a little narrower range on what you would kind of like to do maybe something in the 3% to 5% percent range and how consistent you would like to be now that you can kind of buy back stocks? Yes Tim I think the percentages that I was referring to were referencing the impact to the growth rate in recurring cash flow per share.
I know that.
I was just kind of mentioning if you want to keep it at 5x EBITDA you can borrow another $500 billion a year and use that to buy back stock and obviously you're generating another couple of a hundred million from free cash flow and you can buy back stock and you theoretically could buy back $600 million $800 million in over a year? Sure.
And where I'm going with my comment was when I talk about the impact to recurring cash flow per share that's a measure of either acquisitions or stock buyback so we're certainly not committing ourselves to saying that it’s going to be one or the other and I think it will move as it has over a long period of time depending on what's available to us.
If you go back and look and I think this is somewhat helpful to think about what we've done over the last 6 years about half of the capital that we've produced in the business and the leveraging that we've done in the business about half of that has gone to buy back shares and the other half has gone to either acquisitions or CapEx-related activity.
So it's been about 50-50.
Obviously that's lumpy.
If you go back and look last year we did the DAS acquisition and that took up the majority of cash flow for a quarter and a half or so and we didn't buy back any shares than we had done so in the quarters previous to that.
This quarter we didn't have an acquisition so we bought shares.
It's going to be lumpy but I think over a long period of time you want to guess you could take a guess based on the last 6 years 7 years of activity and ...
I know a couple I think about 50-50.
And then lastly I guess on the antenna front there's obviously a lot of changes in technology a lot of demand but I think what you're trying to say here is you might be looking at more value-based pricing going forward than just size and weight.
I mean if you're -- someone's going to be using this for 200 megahertz of spectrum line antenna when they used to use 25 megahertz.
You are still a very unique asset and you can charge appropriately.
Is that a good way to think about what you're trying to say? Well yes.
I guess you're putting a little bit of words in my mouth.
I think that so far Tim we have not seen that.
We are still largely pricing on physical loading.
Again implicit in all of our pricing is access to a unique asset that ultimately has value obviously.
But as a general statement today we are not seeing really any unloading of the tower.
In fact the contrary.
We're still seeing more loading of the tower.
It's still the most efficient way to get the maximum efficiency out of the spectrum that's being deployed and that's what we're seeing.
So we remain in a sort of committed to that pricing construct.
And just maybe to punctuate and end on Jay's note around the organic growth augmented with investment whether that's acquisitions or share purchases in the past we're committed to basically deploying that capital in the way that augments organic growth.
And I think that was Jay's comment in your script which was 200 to 600 basis points a year is kind of what we can see contribution from that activity in addition to organic.
This year's level of activity that would put us sort of firmly in the mid-teens area.
Obviously we have aspirations to make that as high as we possibly can but given what's going on in the market we're quite comfortable with that in building long-term value in the company.
Thanks.
Thanks for the interest and appreciate you all staying a little long with us today.
We had a long of list of questions but appreciate your interest and patience and look forward to seeing everybody on the call next quarter.

Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
As you've seen from our press release and as outlined on Slide 3 we had an excellent second quarter and are excited about the ongoing deployment of wireless data networks.
The strong year-to-date results and our expectations for the second half of the year allow us to meaningfully increase our outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow outlook for the full year 2011.
Also since the end of the first quarter we have invested over $180 million purchasing our common shares which we believe will enhance long-term recurring cash flow per share.
Turning to Slide 4 I'd like to highlight a few items from the second quarter.
During the second quarter we generated site rental revenue of $457 million up 12% from the second quarter of 2010.
Site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues less the cost of operations was $336 million up 14% from the second quarter of 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2011 was $320 million up 14% from the second quarter of 2010 with an incremental margin of 90% reflecting our continued focus on managing our costs.
Recurring cash flow defined as adjusted EBITDA less interest expense less sustaining capital expenditures was $189 million up 22% from the second quarter of 2010.
And recurring cash flow per share was $0.66 also up 22% from the second quarter of 2010.
It is important to note that these growth rates were achieved almost entirely through organic growth on assets we owned as of April 1 2010 as growth from acquisitions was negligible.
Site rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA benefited by $1.6 million and $1 million respectively from a stronger Australian dollar than assumed in our outlook for the second quarter.
Further there were no significant nonrecurring items in the second quarter.
Turning to investments and liquidity as shown on Slide 6.
During the second quarter we purchased approximately 3.6 million of our common shares and an additional 700 000 shares in July.
Year-to-date we have spent $220 million to purchase our common shares.
Since 2003 we have spent $2.6 billion to purchase approximately 98 million of our common shares and potential shares representing 1/3 of the company's shares and potential shares at an average price of about $26.50 per share.
Further in July we used $6 million of cash to purchase a portion of our 6 1/4 preferred shares.
Also during the second quarter we spent $64 million on capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures include $30 million on our land lease purchase program.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath our towers representing approximately 73% of our U.S.
gross margin up from less than 40% in January 2007 when we completed our acquisition of Global Signal.
Further the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 34 years.
We continue to focus a significant amount of effort on purchasing land beneath our towers and extending our ground leases.
We believe this activity has resulted in the most secured land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease expiration.
This is an important effort because it provides a long-term benefit as it protects our margins and controls our largest operating expense.
During 2011 we expect to close approximately 1 700 land transactions.
Based on our pipeline of yields we would expect about 1/3 of these transactions to be purchases.
I believe our current level of spend on this activity is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we spent $5 million on sustaining capital expenditures in the quarter and $26 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures.
The latter consisting of $19 million on existing sites and $10 million on the construction of new sites including distributed and tenant system deployments.
Additionally during the second quarter we increased our revolving credit facility by $50 million to $450 million of which $220 million is currently drawn.
We ended the second quarter of 2011 with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 5.3x the lowest in the company's history with no meaningful maturities in the next 3 years and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of 3.2x.
Moving to the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2011 as shown on Slides 7 and 8 we expect site rental revenue of between $461 million and $466 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $319 million and $324 million for the third quarter 2011.
Turning to the full year 2011 outlook based on our first half results and our visibility into near-term leasing activity we have meaningfully increased our full year 2011 outlook from what we provided in April increasing site rental revenue by $20 million site rental gross margin by $17 million adjusted EBITDA by $28 million and recurring cash flow by $27 million.
This increase in our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is driven largely by the following items: Increasing our expectation of the leasing activity by approximately 15% to 20% for the balance of the year; secondly higher run rate site rental revenues as we exited the second quarter; third increasing our expectation of the contribution from our services business by approximately $8 million for the full year; and finally the expected benefit of favorable foreign exchange rates in our Australian business from our previous outlook.
We now expect site rental revenue growth in 2011 of approximately 9% comprised of approximately 4% growth in the existing base of business and 5% growth from the expected additional tenant equipment to be added to our sites and recurring cash flow growth of 15% year-over-year.
As shown on Slide 9 we expect to generate approximately $380 million of recurring cash flow for the balance of the year and spend approximately $160 million on capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites including distributed antenna systems.
The remaining portion of the recurring cash flow ignoring our financing capacity represents approximately $220 million of cash flow for the balance of 2011 that we could invest in activities related to our core business including reducing common shares outstanding as well as acquisitions.
Consistent with our past practice our 2011 outlook does not include the benefit from expected future investments such as share purchases tower acquisition new site construction and land purchases that we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow which again we believe is the most important long-term measure of shareholder value today.
In summary we had an excellent second quarter as we continue to execute around our core business.
And with that I'm happy to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and good morning to all of you.
And thanks for joining us on the call this morning.
As Jay just mentioned we had an excellent second quarter exceeding the high end of our outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow which together with our expectations for the second half of the year allowed us to significantly increase guidance for the full year 2011.
AT&amp;T and Verizon continued their aggressive rollout of LTE and as Sprint announced yesterday we are very pleased to be partnering with them as they deploy their multiyear Network Vision plans.
As you might have seen Sprint announced a spectrum hosting agreement with LightSquared this morning.
Crown Castle has amended our contracts with Sprint to include provisions which would allow Sprint to host LightSquared spectrum on their new Network Vision equipment for an adjustment in rent.
As the largest single provider of sites to Sprint we are well-positioned to capture a greater share of the economics of this build relative to our peers.
We are pleased to play a significant role in facilitating this efficient approach to network deployment that should improve the prospects for a successful launch while fairly compensating Crown Castle for its valuable assets.
With all 3 of the largest U.S.
carriers actively engaged in network upgrades we believe we are entering a period of increased revenue growth associated with these deployments.
In addition our services business continues to perform very well demonstrating our ability to execute for customers and their willingness to give us an increasing amount of this work.
Consistent with our longstanding practice and approach to capital allocation we invested over $180 million since April 1 in our own common stock which in our judgment was the best investment available to us during this period.
Before I turn the call over to questions I'd like to make a few comments about the trends in the wireless environment from which we are benefiting.
Smartphones continue to drive wireless data revenue and according to Nielsen's May survey of mobile consumers in the U.S.
38% of the population base now own smartphones compared to 23% at the end of 2009 and 55% of those who purchased a new handset in the last 3 months reported buying a smartphone instead of a feature phone and that's up from 34% just a year ago.
In fact smartphone penetration is expected to surpass 50% in 2012.
Similarly the amount of data the average smartphone user consumes per month has grown by 89% from 230 megabytes in the first quarter of 2010 to 435 megabytes in the first quarter of 2011.
A look at the distribution of data consumption is even more revealing.
Data usage for the top 10% of smartphone users has doubled while the top 1% has grown their usage by 2.5x from 1.8 gigabytes in the first quarter of 2010 to over 4.6 gigabytes in the first quarter of 2011.
Consumers with iPhone and android smartphones consumed the most data 582 megabytes per month for the average android user and 492 megabytes for the average iPhone user with the android market -- android operating system now ranking as the top system with 38% of smartphone subscribers while Apple in the #2 position with 27% of the smartphone market.
The continued penetration of smartphones and other data-enabled devices coupled with the ever-increasing appetite for and consumption of data requires the carriers to increase the density of their network and upgrade their existing sites.
This is a trend that has been ongoing for a number of years.
As the largest owner of sites in the top 100 market we are benefiting from this trend which is continuing unabated.
The impact of the previous statistics is evident in the U.S.
wireless market as data services grew 23% year-over-year to reach $15.4 billion in the first quarter of 2011.
In fact data revenues are expected to exceed voice revenues in the U.S.
market in 2013.
As can be seen in the wireless carriers’ results the demand for data services and the resulting revenue and margin growth is yielding high incremental returns on the investment of capital required to provision additional data capacity.
We are clearly a beneficiary of this virtuous cycle of investment.
Looking out beyond the current deployment activity there is a significant amount of spectrum available to be deployed in the hands of companies like Dish Clearwire and LightSquared.
We believe this spectrum has the most value in the more densely populated areas and having the largest portfolio of towers in the most populated areas in the U.S.
we are uniquely positioned to facilitate the future deployment of this spectrum.
Before I wrap up one quick comment on the Sprint press release that many of you have seen from yesterday.
We are obviously thrilled with the relationship and the continuing partnership to assist them in building out their Network Vision plan.
Some of you have already asked about the specific financial terms of the contract and as has been our practice we won't comment beyond what Sprint put in their press release yesterday.
However I would say this contract establishes the price and the process by which they can access our sites but gives us no certainty of future amendment activity.
So to wrap up I'd like to reiterate a few points from this morning.
We are very pleased with our results and I believe they demonstrate the quality of our assets combined with our ability to execute for our customers.
As always we remain disciplined and focused on maximizing long-term recurring cash flow per share through opportunistic investments such as in the most recent quarter buying back our own common stock.
And at a macro level we are incredibly excited about the trends we are seeing in wireless and our position to capture value from them.
We are focused on the U.S.
market because it is the largest market in the world with revenues estimated to be over $186 billion this year and still growing 7% year-over-year.
Further smartphone penetration is only now approaching 40% suggesting a long runway of profitable investment for wireless carriers and by extension additional demand for our sites in the coming years.
We have the best located assets in the industry and significantly more towers in the top 100 markets of the U.S.
than any of our peers.
Our customer surveys continue to indicate that Crown Castle delivers the highest level of customer satisfaction in the industry something we remain very proud of.
So in closing we had an excellent second quarter and look forward to finishing the year strong.
With that operator we'd be pleased to turn the call over for questions.
[Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Jay a question on the balance sheet.
Strong free cash generation you noted the leverage was down to 5.3 very impressive.
You've got a lot more cash here – cash flow coming in the rest of the year.
How are you thinking about your medium-term leverage targets and the ability to maybe use some financing here to get a little bit more aggressive on the buybacks versus balancing the kind of the potential weak conversion down the road and having a conservative capital structure? Sure.
Thanks for the question Simon.
We haven't changed our target of thinking about the balance sheet in 4x to 6x of debt to adjusted EBITDA level and we're approaching sort of a midpoint of that which is I said in the past I would expect on most days that's where we're going to operate the company in and around that level.
As we've delevered I think what we've done is created some opportunity for us to be opportunistic as maybe an acquisition or other opportunity comes along.
And we wouldn't necessarily be opposed to seeing the leverage tick up for the right transaction.
But again I think most of the time you're going to see us operate the business in and around 5x.
And the second part of that question really leads to how much cash flow do we have available in the business? And in a normal year we're growing recurring cash flow or adjusted EBITDA if you wan to think about it that way in the neighborhood of $100 million per year.
So if we were to maintain in the neighborhood of 5x the leverage that would give us the capacity of an additional $500 million of borrowing in addition to the cash flow that we're producing in the business within the neighborhood of $750 million.
So there's meaningful amounts of flexibility that we have at this current level of leverage.
The other part of your question as we think longer term about REIT conversion today we have about $2 billion of net operating losses and I would expect that we would exhaust those before converting to a REIT and that would put us somewhere in the neighborhood of 2015 or 2016 before we would expect to make that REIT conversion.
And I do think there is probably value at that point in time to having an investment grade credit rating once we're in the area of converting to a REIT.
And that would suggest a leverage level that may be slightly below that 5x target.
So we'll just have to look at it over time and continue to manage the balance sheet appropriately and I would just -- I would indicate that we'll continue to do that with an appropriate level of flexibility.
And I think that's really what we've -- what I'm trying to point out by saying that we are down to the lowest level in the company's history.
I think we're at a place now where we do have some flexibility maybe in past periods where we didn't have that flexibility.
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
I understand that you don't talk about customers but can you give people a little bit of comfort that the network-sharing deal sort of protects you for the long-term? And give us an idea of where the pricing for that comes in versus a sort of a regular amendment you would've gotten anyway with Sprint because of their Network Vision plan and versus sort of a new tenant? Yes Phil I appreciate the question and know full well why you would want to understand that.
But here's the situation.
We are very comfortable with the transaction that we've struck.
As Sprint alluded to we think it's fair for both sides.
It provides a very efficient way for in this example LightSquared to be deployed across the Network Vision equipment at the same time compensating us appropriately for the rights that they're going to gain by doing that.
I'm not going to go into really any of the economics and if for no other reason let me impress upon you one particular reason.
I don't necessarily believe this is the last of these we'll see.
We may see more opportunity with Sprint or we may see other opportunities to host other parties’ spectrum across existing networks from others of our customers.
And I just don't think it's in our interests or frankly in our customers’ interest for us to be talking about the economics.
We're very pleased with the transaction.
It's implied in our guidance both for the rest of this year.
And then obviously as we look forward to next year we'll roll it in as we see activity and then make our judgment for next year and the years to come.
But that's really where we're going to come out on that.
Maybe if I can press my luck a little bit and follow up on what you just said can we be assured that there's incremental revenue to be had for each additional entity that would be hosted? Yes.
Our next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.
Just 2 if I could quickly.
Can you tell us if the new deal with Sprint or for that matter LightSquared is any part of the increase in the second half revenue or EBITDA guidance? And secondly regarding capital structure and the like clearly buybacks and you accelerated significantly this quarter any thoughts around a dividend potentially in advance of having to issue one as part of a REIT structure? James thanks for the question.
With regards to your first question around the increase in our outlook I think as we talked about on the first quarter call we didn't expect to see in calendar year 2011 much activity from Sprint.
We thought that most of the Network Vision activity would be a really late 2011 event potentially not even see that until the beginning of 2012.
And as I mentioned in my comments we've increased the amount for activity of leasing that we would expect to see in the second half of this year by about 15% to 20% and a big portion of that would be related to what we're seeing from Sprint.
So it absolutely is embedded in some of that but it would all be -- basically all of it would be forward-looking based on the activity that they talked about it this morning on their call as well as the activity that we're seeing from the work that we're doing with them currently.
The second part of your question in terms of accelerating a dividend ahead of the REIT conversion I think we've been really clear over a long period of time that there's a certain level of CapEx that we would expect to spend in the business around the core activities of adding additional tenants to the tower as well as things like distributed antenna systems that we've done and the land purchase program.
And beyond that that excess cash flow to the extent that they are not acquisitions for us to purchase we would expect to return that capital to shareholders.
And we've been committed to returning that capital to shareholders over a very long period of time.
That's why we can think about it as investing or having returned to shareholders $2.6 billion since 2003.
So I think that's an activity that we're committed to.
We do look carefully and have looked carefully over a long period of time at the trade-offs between paying a dividend and buying back shares.
And I would imagine on an ongoing basis we'll continue to look at that and study that and make the decision at future dates as to what the appropriate thing to do was.
At this point though we've decided that as for the last quarter that share purchases were the appropriate way to returning capital to shareholders.
Our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Two maybe if I could.
Just a follow-up again on the Sprint situation Jay.
Maybe if you could kind of give us a sense.
You said that some of the second half guidance benefit is coming from accelerated leasing.
Is that Sprint? Or is it other carriers? And is that related to cash income? Or simply changes in the life of the agreement which are giving us a non-cash benefit? If you could kind of elaborate on the cash versus non-cash and how substantive Sprint is in that second half number that would be helpful.
And then I guess the second question maybe is for Ben which is that obviously for the last couple months we've all been looking in the rearview mirror and there's been a lot of handwringing about the AT&amp;T T-Mobile deal.
And I think that we're -- people are starting to get comfortable that it could actually yield more benefits than risks in the short-term.
But as we look out into the headlights we've got Charlie Ergen consolidating spectrum in the S band.
We've got the cable companies reportedly doing more strategic thinking around their business the public safety both the Republican and Democratic proposals look to be funding public safety networks.
Is there any kind of bubbling up in the surface that you're seeing of the new demand conversations that you weren’t having before; anything tangible about the new opportunities that as we look into '12 and '13? Dave on your first question there's a litany of things that are running through the revenue line there that helped us increase our outlook.
I would mention all of them because I think they're relevant if you're looking at site rental revenue.
And the 3 components would be the benefit that we've seen in FX.
Secondly where we saw run rate revenues.
I mentioned the FX adjustment in the second quarter to bring you down to where revenues would have been on a like-for-like basis relative to the outlook and we came in even above slightly above our outlook for the second quarter even adjusting for FX.
So that run rate obviously flows through the balance of the year which helped us increase revenues.
And then the leasing activity of the increase of 15% to 20%.
As Ben mentioned specific to Sprint the arrangement that we have with them gives certainties to both parties around the price and process at which they deploy their new Network Vision equipment.
But it doesn't give us certainty of activity in terms of what we will actually see related to that.
So I think you will see the revenues follow as the activity follows.
And that's embedded in that 15% to 20% increase that we're expecting in actual leasing activity.
And therein lies the increase for the outlook for the balance of the year.
So just to -- and I apologize Ben.
If I could just quickly follow up on that Jay.
So that is to say that this is actually new business that you're doing with Sprint rather than some part of this agreement being lease extensions which are giving you some accounting benefit which is part of the guidance increase.
Yes the guidance increase that we talked about would be related to our activity base the work that we're doing for all of the carriers.
And we're culling out Sprint.
There's actually increases from more than just Sprint but in trying to answer your question that's embedded in that 15% to 20%.
Dave I guess what -- the second part of your question around basically spectrum that's been aggregated and is idle I'll park that for just a moment because I want to make sure we hit a theme of this call that I wan to impress upon everyone and that it is our pleasure frankly that we're seeing in 3 national carriers being very active in upgrading their networks.
With Sprint's announcements and their commitment to this Network Vision plan and what that suggests in terms of upgrades and activity improving their network providing additional capacity to their customers and now facilitating a very efficient way to launch LightSquared should they choose to proceed on that basis.
We are extremely excited that you're going to see all 3 national carriers be very aggressive in upgrading capacity and that is a marked change for our business at least from my chair.
So I just want to make sure we've got that point across this morning.
Now going forward I think we've all witnessed a lot of spectrum being aggregated and accumulated and some of it deployed and some of it not over time.
I think we along with most on this call sort of wait with baited breath to see how some of that spectrum attempts to come to the market.
I think in the example this morning with Sprint and the hosting arrangement it provides a very interesting roadmap for an efficient way to launch spectrum without a completely new greenfield build.
And as I've suggested we'll be very supportive of that and facilitate that in a way that we think benefits both parties.
But beyond that I can't identify for you a specific additional spectrum build that's coming to the market in any particular timeline.
But I remain very optimistic that given the consumer demand that we've seen and the capacity requirements and as that continues to grow that this spectrum will get put to use in some form or fashion in some business plan that maybe we haven't contemplated yet.
And certainly our assets would play a material role in facilitating that coming to the market.
Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
Just 2 questions.
I know you can only get into so many details about the agreement with Sprint.
But Sprint did indicate in their LightSquared announcement this morning that there are conditions that could cause the agreement to be terminated.
So I'm just curious if that were to happen and they just really can't get this off the ground would you actually owe any refunds to Sprint for any work you might have done already? No.
Okay good.
And then just a bigger-picture question.
This is sort of a follow-up to something that was -- that came up a bit earlier.
If I look at the way you're investing your money this year the buybacks and other investments have essentially been contained to the size of the cash flow that you're creating in 2011.
But because of where you're getting with regards to your leverage level it seems like your total investment capacity as we move into next year might actually be greater than the amount of cash you create from operations and so there'd be sort of disproportionate increase in your investment capacity relative to your cash flow growth.
Is that an appropriate way of thinking about it? Yes Brett I think that naturally happens as we approach that 5 turns of leverage level to the extent that we maintain that level of leverage then $750 million roughly of recurring cash flow and then you subtract out the amount of CapEx that we're spending on an annualized basis somewhere in the neighborhood of about $300 million to $350 million of CapEx leaving you $400 million of excess cash flow.
At that point if we are borrowing to maintain 5x and growth in EBITDA is around $100 million then you're more than doubling the amount of excess cash flow available for investments be that share purchases or tower acquisitions or other investments around the core business.
So you're right.
There is the opportunity for that number to increase in terms of capacity.
But it's potentially a lot.
I mean that $220 million that you have available for the rest of the year it's arguably half the run rate you could have next year if you're comfortable doing more work in the capital markets.
Is that reasonable? That's correct.
That's correct.
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.</strong> Sort of to follow up a little bit and trying to keep us honest with the straight -- the LightSquared-Sprint agreement and what your MLA change it.
Sprint yesterday in their press release talked about a uniform rate I think that they were going at.
And you've mentioned a couple of times the price certainty and the process certainty.
If Sprint were to put up new equipment that was Vision without LightSquared would that be a different rent to you guys as opposed to Sprint with LightSquared? And to piggyback on Phil's question if it's Sprint plus LightSquared plus somebody else is that a third in the hire rent? In other words is there like an A B C of that uniform rate that Sprint was talking to? Yes Rick let me help you with that.
That's pretty straightforward.
There is a price certainty which they were alluding to on the Network Vision equipment installation which we granted them price and process.
There's also price certainty should they elect to host LightSquared and then there'll be yet to be determined but it is specific to LightSquared but to the extent they wanted to bring others to host we could certainly have a conversation about that.
But it's at the moment LightSquared-specific as to price.
Inc.</strong> Right.
And if some -- if a second posting it would be another price certain for the extra add-on from that one? I mean we would entertain a conversation at that point if there were more.
But it's not contemplated today.
Inc.</strong> Because I think the market is a little concerned that Sprint's adding “$9 billion from a company that doesn't really have that much money.” So people are trying to make sure Sprint's not spending money they don't have and then passing on money that they have to pay you in rent that maybe isn't going to be able to be good money.
Yes I think we've probably commented as far as we're going to go on the pricing.
Again it's one level for the network upgrade; it's another for sharing specifically to LightSquared.
And then anything beyond that would be open for discussion.
Inc.</strong> To piggyback on David's comments earlier and yours I think.
While you haven't given 2012 guidance yet maybe 1 do you anticipate getting 2012 guidance in your typical timeline of third quarter call? And given the macro that you've discussed about 3 national carriers now building versus 2 is it a fairly safe assumption on a macro level without any numbers attached to it that leasing activity in '12 should very well be higher than the leasing activity we saw in '11 in the U.S.? Rick I appreciate the question and I think I'm about to step in something I don't want to.
We would expect to give guidance in the third quarter and the great benefit of giving guidance in the third quarter for next year is we can wait until October to determine what we think about 2012 leasing.
So I’ll leave it at that.
Inc.</strong> But the common thread is 3 national guys building that one you've just been experiencing really 2.
That's not bad break for the second half of 2011 yes.
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Just I guess quickly on capital allocation that the sort of decision tree buying back your stock tapping private markets for deal activity or buying land 2Q you've over-indexed on buybacks.
Relative to where you stand right now and sort of looking forward over the next few months has anything in that calculation changed? I mean we heard about private multiples being too high on the first quarter call.
Has that backed off at all? Should we expect more activity there? And I guess second question is just a refresher on the international framework.
You guys historically have sort of thought differently about the risks associated with a lot of the international markets that your peers have gone into.
I'm wondering if you could just sort of remind us if the thinking is still there? Or have the risks in your mind changed at all? Okay on the first question Jason I don't think currently anything has changed from what we talked about last time in the domestic market.
Obviously that could change tomorrow.
So I don’t know that that's a forward-looking statement but commenting on relative to what we saw during the quarter it looks like domestically nothing has changed in that environment and that's why we spent the money we did on buyback of shares.
I mean it's no secret.
We’ve for the past years earned the multiple down 30% in this business.
And that continues to be sort of less than we're seeing in the private market.
And given our position and ability to execute around our sites we're quite happy to acquire more of our site.
It's been our practice for some time.
But against that we always look at other alternatives and your question about international is 1 we continue to spend time on and look at but we see international transactions trading frankly within reasonable shouting distance of our current multiple which we just can't quite get there on.
The second thing I'd say about international is our international business in Australia we haven't commented on this call but we do have high expectations next year around growth.
And that market is looking increasingly like it's going to hit another inflection point that has been somewhat slow for the last 2 or 3 years.
And so we are excited about what we see down there.
And again not a huge component of our business but could be a larger component of our growth going forward.
So we are anxious and working now already on executing and preparing for next year.
So Jason it's really business as usual.
We're going to continue to look international opportunities.
If you see us do something you can assume that it's because we believe that presents a longer-term greater value creation on a risk-adjusted basis than acting on something here in the U.S.
But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we are extremely excited about what we see in the U.S.
market right now and we're going to continue to execute like we are.
And so then your optimism on Australia is this where you're positioned with the existing assets? Or would you want to get ahead of this inflection that you're talking about with increased exposure in that market? Well we would certainly look at additional assets to the extent they were available.
I'll just leave it at that.
But certainly we've got a long way to go to optimize and exploit our existing assets so there's opportunity on both sides there.
Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
LLC</strong> A couple of questions.
G&amp;A expense declined a bit sequentially.
I wondered what kind of levels we should expect going forward? And then the Sprint Network Vision plan does contemplate ultimately the removal of iDEN equipment maybe after next year at some point.
And is that treated separately under your agreement with them? Or is that already contemplated in the agreement that was announced yesterday? On your first question around G&amp;A the sequential growth a portion of that is the continued Verizon FX down in Australia.
So that's a big portion of that.
And I think as you're modeling the business Jon for periods beyond 2011 I would expect that we'll continue to manage that G&amp;A somewhere in the neighborhood of 3% or less as a growing number subject to any acquisition that we would do of any size would obviously drive that number up a little bit.
But we're not seeing anything in the business that would suggest our long-stated approach of maintaining that number in and around 3% growth to change from that.
On your iDEN question with Sprint Jon I would really ask you to probably address that question to Sprint in terms of their decommissioning plans around iDEN.
With respect to our company we still maintain our Nextel leases have I think on average about 3.5 half years of average life left in the book on that and I think we can all reasonably assume as they've said it's their objective to migrate that to their Network Vision equipment.
But that's really for them to determine and frankly I think that's still a couple years out as they see the progress on their CDMA side.
And right now our Nextel exposure is about 2% of revenues if you will.
LLC</strong> Okay that's helpful.
And then on outdoor DAS any kind of updated views? How do you size that overall market opportunity? Yes pardon me for not mentioning it on this call only because it's still not a material significantly material part of our financial results but we are very excited about what we see around DAS continue to see it growing rapidly.
We're very pleased with our acquisition of NewPath NewPath Networks Company last September.
We've got a team now of about 45 individuals dedicated solely to DAS as well as the shared resource in our sales organization.
And so we are seeing significant amounts of activity on the DAS front both outdoor and indoor and we've got our plate full there still maintain high expectations for growth there.
Our next question comes from the line of Clay Moran with Benchmark Capital.
LLC</strong> Maybe you could give us an update on your portfolio of towers the average capacity remaining and maybe the percent that is full.
And I also noticed that tower construction activity has ticked up pretty meaningfully this year not really material but just wondering where you're finding opportunities and any reason for that change.
Sure.
On the first question around capacity we continue to find capacity on the sites and don't believe that we're nearing a point where the assets are full.
We've learned to be pretty creative around how to create space and adjust amend and extend these sites in order to hold additional equipment.
And so we're not really running into a capacity issue on the sites.
On the second part of your question around construction we have seen that start to pick up a little bit.
We've built a few more sites and we're mostly focused on the Metro areas as we have done historically.
The biggest portion of the increase though if you look at the spend on new sites would be related to the distributed antenna systems that we continue to invest in.
And my guess is that for full year 2011 or certainly by the end of this year and going into 2012 we'll be at a run rate of spending in the neighborhood of about $50 million a year of CapEx specifically on the distributed antenna systems deployment.
LLC</strong> Okay.
On the capacity question can you just then give us average tenant per tower today? We're at about 3 tenants per tower a little over 3 tenants per tower on a fiscal basis.
Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Maybe we could talk a little bit more about the portfolio.
I noticed that you guys continue to cull some of the towers out.
I guess I've been looking for this activity to kind of taper off and start to see some portfolio growth so maybe if you can give us a little more color on where you are in terms of working through some of the culling of the tower assets.
Yes Jonathan.
Thanks for the question.
We continue to look at the assets and when we look at them we're really looking at 2 areas.
One is what's the current run rate of cash flows on the assets.
And then secondly we're looking at what's the prospect of additional growth.
And as we work through the portfolio and there are changes particularly with regards to some of the towers that we acquired back when we did the GSL acquisition.
There was a portfolio that they had purchased that had some paging exposure to it and some of those towers that would have had paging on them where the paging has churned and maybe the tower is vacant and today we look at it and assess what we believe the future growth of the asset could be to the extent that we don't see a lot of opportunities for it then we'll go out and take the sites down.
I think we're through most of that.
I mean there will forever be times when we're taking down towers.
I would expect we'll have some of that every quarter.
But I think the bulk of that analysis and work has really been done following our acquisition of Global Signal.
So I think it will taper off over time.
If you're trying to figure out what the impact of the results is frankly most of the time that culling is the slight increase to adjusted EBITDA and probably no impact to site rental revenue if there are tenants on towers we're not going through and disposing of those towers.
So I think on a net basis it would be slightly positive to adjusted EBITDA and cash flows but if the numbers is so small you couldn't find it in the financials.
Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.
Two questions.
One on -- one more follow-up on the Sprint contract.
Can you actually talk about if the contract is specific spectrum-specific for Sprint and LightSquared's current spectrum band? And the other question I had was on the revenue growth trajectory for the second half.
I think the outlook implies that the growth will decelerate to 6% because of the MLA you signed a year ago.
But then where -- but implied guidance for 4Q is actually looking for a further deceleration maybe growth going below 5%.
And with Sprint helping and actually Verizon spending a bit more than we thought shouldn't we see a larger sequential bump in the fourth quarter? First on the spectrum question Batya it's specific to the LightSquared spectrum again.
So to the extent they choose to avail themselves of that option it's called out specifically.
And to the extent they wanted to do something else then we're certainly pleased to engage in a conversation around that.
I think in regards to your second question it has to do with the percentage of changes versus nominal changes.
If you look at the nominal change in dollars we continue to perform very well on that basis sequentially quarter-to-quarter.
As you remember last year in the third quarter we announced the amendment with the customer that significantly increased the amount of rents that we were receiving and the results of that basically makes a base that's lower in the first 2 quarters of last year that we're comparing against for the first 2 quarters of this year.
By the time you get to the third quarter you're comparing off of that then higher run rate.
So we're getting larger and that bigger base means by definition the percentages are going to come down.
To the extent in the fourth quarter I think obviously we have some visibility in terms of what we see for the third quarter and we'll have to see and play out how the fourth quarter develops.
Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.
LLC</strong> I just had a couple of quick ones.
And I think you've already kind of addressed this to some extent but I really just want to make sure that I have it right.
Last quarter I think you said that you expected activity in Q2 and the second half of 2011 to be flat from Q1 levels and that overall leasing activity will be down around 15% from 2010.
Just given that you had just raised guidance what are your new assumptions for the second half of '11 versus the first half of the year? And then what -- how do you think activity for the full year 2011 compares to that of 2010? Sure.
I think with regard to 2011 full year versus 2010 the change in our outlook for the balance of the year basically brings the full year 2011 back up to a level similar to what we did in 2010.
And you're correct leaving the first quarter as I think I mentioned earlier we thought that the majority of the activity that we would see in the full year was just going to come from the 2 largest carriers in the U.S.
And so the change here is a little bit change in activity broadly across all carriers but specifically the timing and amount of the activity that we would expect from Sprint for the balance of the year as they get to work on Network Vision.
And so I think that's really the -- that's the increase and almost all of that would be third and fourth quarter related in 2011 not as much in the second quarter.
But for the full year I think by the time we get -- we close 2011 we would expect at least today that on a leasing basis we'll be pretty similar to what we did in 2010.
LLC</strong> Got it.
That makes a lot of sense.
And then I mean obviously you said Sprint is contributing now.
Is it safe to assume that AT&amp;T and Verizon are still like roughly half of leasing activity this year? Or is Sprint such that -- is Sprint becoming a bare component? Gray we -- I don't want to comment necessarily specifically on the amount of activity by carrier.
But they're obviously continuing to be meaningful and so I'll leave it at that.
LLC</strong> Okay.
Then just last one if I may.
Any thoughts on a potential public safety network next year? We can only hope.
Obviously we stand ready to facilitate it.
We'll have to see.
It looks like Congress is a little distracted here at the moment.
Our final question is from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
Actually I just had more of a general question for you.
As we get closer down the road of the tele companies becoming a REIT potentially into next year how do you guys feel about disclosing metrics that relate to the way REIT investors look at assets? So providing what your comparison would be for like FFO AFFO and just giving people more information.
I know you give already some stuff on your recurring cash flow metrics but have you given some thought in terms of extending the disclosure to some of those metrics so you could be more comparable to a larger peer group? Mike thanks for the question.
We have given some thought to that and we've noticed with interest that as you look at some of the fact sheets that the REITs produced they'll put out sometimes 40 50 pages worth of detail where they show revenues by market tenants by market and assets by market in addition to the metrics that you’ve talked about.
And I think we'll study that over time.
And I think to the extent that the industry attracts a different type of an investor and we start to attract those REIT investors I would believe that those will become increasingly important.
And so moving from our recurring cash flow metric at some point in time towards more of an FFO metric probably makes sense in order to help us be comparable with other REITs that they would be used to looking at.
So I think you'll see us watch that look at it and then try to determine when is the appropriate time to do that.
But longer-term I think certainly that will be the case.
All right.
I think I'll just wrap up real quickly.
I appreciate everybody joining us today.
We are feeling great about the business obviously with 3 active carriers in the market building significant upgrades to their networks as we've talked about.
And then we're executing a very high level on the opportunities before us as evidenced by our results.
And for that I certainly credit our team everybody involved.
And we look forward to the rest of the year and we'll talk to you in the next quarter's call.
Thank you.
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
That does conclude our conference for today.

Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
As you've seen from our press release and as outlined on Slide 3 we had an excellent third quarter exceeding the high end of our previously issued guidance for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow.
The strong year-to-date results from our Site Rental business together with better-than-expected performance from our Services business allow us to increase our 2011 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by approximately $18 million.
Also during the third quarter we invested $278 million in activities around our core business which we believe will enhance long-term recurring cash flow per share.
Turning to Slide 4 I'd like to highlight a few things from our third quarter results.
During the third quarter we generated site rental revenue of $469 million up 7% from the third quarter of 2010.
Site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues less cost of operations was $347 million 8% from the third quarter of 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2011 was $332 million up 9% from the third quarter of 2010.
As shown on Slide 5 recurring cash flow defined as adjusted EBITDA less interest expense less sustaining capital expenditures was $199 million up 12% from the third quarter of 2010 and recurring cash flow per share was $0.70 up 13% from the third quarter of 2010.
It is important to note that these growth rates were achieved almost entirely through organic growth on assets that we owned as of July 1 2010 as growth from acquisitions was negligible.
Turning to investments and liquidity during the third quarter as shown on Slide 6 we spent $278 million on purchases of our common and preferred shares capital expenditures and acquisitions.
Specifically during the third quarter we purchased approximately 2.7 million of our common shares for $109 million.
Further we used $15 million of cash to purchase a portion of our 6 1/4 preferred shares reducing the potential common shares by a little over 300 000 shares.
Since 2003 we have spent $2.7 billion to purchase approximately 100 million of our common shares and potential common shares representing more than 1/3 of the company's shares at an average price of $26.84 per share.
With regards to our capital expenditures during the third quarter we spent $148 million.
These capital expenditures include $111 million in our land lease purchase program which includes an $89 million purchase of our ground leases in a single transaction.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 75% of our site rental gross margin up from less than 40% in January 2007 when we completed our acquisition of Global Signal.
We continue to enjoy significant success with this program as evidenced by the fact that today 37% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own up from less than 15% in January of 2007.
Further the remaining average term on our ground leases is approximately 34 years.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we spent $6 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $31 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures the latter consisting of $20 million on existing sites and $11 million on the construction of new sites including most notably distributed antenna system deployments.
The final component of our investments in the third quarter were tower acquisitions of approximately $6 million.
We ended the third quarter of 2011 with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 5.2x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of 3.3x.
Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2011 as shown on Slide 7 and 8 we expect site rental revenue of between $467 million and $472 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $330 million and $335 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Our revised full year 2011 outlook suggests that annual site rental revenue growth of 9% and recurring cash flow growth of approximately 18%.
Substantially all of the anticipated growth is expected to come from the assets we own at the beginning of 2010 as we've made no significant acquisitions during the last 2 years.
The growth in site rental revenue from 2010 to 2011 is comprised of approximately 5% attributable to additional tenant equipment added to the sites reflecting the strong leasing activity we have enjoyed since the beginning of 2011 and approximately 4% growth in the existing base of business that was in place at the beginning of the year through contracted escalators and the renewal of tenant leases net of churn.
Turning to Slide 9 before I take you through the 2012 outlook I would like to take a minute to talk through some significant initiatives we've sent out [ph] to accomplish a few years ago and our progress today.
First we wanted to refinance and extend our debt maturities over multiple years and lower our level of leverage to strengthen our balance sheet and increase our financial flexibility; second we wanted to protect our long-term margins by securing our towers that reside on land leases through purchasing land and extending land leases beyond 30 years; and third we wanted to improve the quality and the duration of our tenant contracts.
We have made significant progress on all of these initiatives in some cases beyond what we thought was possible.
We believe that these actions have increased the certainty of future cash flows lowered our exposure to fluctuations from the debt markets and improved our customer relationships.
Over time we believe these improvements in our core business and capital structure will lower our cost of equity particularly as we anticipate nearing a period of time when our recurring cash flows may be distributed in the form of dividends.
Between 2009 and 2010 we refinanced over $6 billion of debt securities extending the terms and spreading the maturities over multiple years.
Further we have lowered our leverage from 7.5x in 2007 to 5.2x today.
As a result we believe we have tremendous flexibility and funding capacity to focus on investing activities we believe will enhance long-term recurring cash flow per share.
On the land lease side we have completed almost 11 000 land transactions including both purchases and extensions.
The focus on this activity which we commenced in earnest in 2007 underscores the long-term view we take of our business as we have invested nearly $675 million in securing our land rights and purchasing the land beneath our towers.
We believe that this activity has resulted in the most secure land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease exploration and we believe that we have significantly reduced our potential risk to margin erosion.
Finally similar to our land lease purchase program we endeavor to improve our tenant contracts.
As we entered 2008 we had approximately $1 billion of aggregate contracted rent due beyond 5 years as is shown on Slide 9.
We made it a priority to secure our tenant contracts for longer periods as we reached the first renewal periods of the original anchored tenant contracts on the majority of our sites.
Since the beginning of 2008 we have extended approximately 27 000 of our tenant licenses for up to 15 years.
As a result today we have more than $10 billion of aggregate contracted rent due beyond 5 years.
Further as shown on Slide 10 we've more than doubled the weighted average life of our tenant contracts to approximately 9 years from 4 years with the total of $17 billion of contracted rent compared to $5 billion at the beginning of 2008.
This $17 billion of contracted rent represents non-cancelable contracts with our customers.
Considering what is left to be addressed over the 5 years there is approximately 36% of the existing portfolio of tenant contracts that will reach a renewal period spread nearly equally over that period of time.
Typically our tenant lease contracts have annual fixed escalations of 3% to 5%.
As such today the contractual terms of our tenant licenses indicate that by the end of the weighted average life of these leases the annual revenue from these leases will have increased by over 30% illustrating the benefit of these long-term contracts and their embedded escalations.
In extending the term of our customer leases we have also modified the contractual terms to help speed the deployment of our customer's data rollouts.
In addition the modifications to our customer licenses give us certainty of pricing and in some cases certainty of activity in the deployment of 4G wireless networks.
Moving now to the full year 2012 outlook and as shown on Slide 11 for the full year 2012 we expect site rental revenue of approximately $1.94 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.37 billion.
Further we anticipate producing nearly $3 per share of recurring cash flow in 2012 based on our current shares outstanding more than double what it was just 5 years ago.
In 2012 we expect site rental revenue growth of approximately $90 million wholly comprised of new leasing activity in the form of amendments to existing installations and brand-new installations on our towers.
As shown on Slide 12 this is in line with the growth in organic leasing we have enjoyed since about 2007.
We expect a vast majority of this revenue to come from Verizon AT&amp;T and Sprint.
We have not included any potential revenue from the network sharing arrangement between Sprint and LightSquared.
Typically in a year where we have no significant customer contract renewals such as 2008 we would expect to see approximately 1% to 2% of growth on the existing base of business from lease escalators net of churn.
In 2012 we expect that higher than average churn will offset the normal benefit from escalators.
This additional churn specifically relates to Alltel licenses Verizon is expected to terminate as the result of its acquisition of Alltel in 2009.
While the number of licenses that we expect will churn is only approximately 10% higher than 2011 the churn is expected to occur mostly in the first half of 2012 and this timing increases the impact to revenues from the churn by approximately 50% as compared to 2011.
Therefore we do not expect the existing base of -- therefore we expect the base of business to be flat year-over-year as we do not expect any significant extensions to offset the churn that I mentioned previously.
Similar to past years we would expect to begin next year with about 97% of our outlook for site rental revenue contracted on January 1.
I would also note that we are expecting to see our Services business perform at a level similar to what we've seen in 2011.
Consistent with our past practice our 2012 outlook does not include the benefit from expected future investments such as share purchases tower acquisitions new site construction and land purchases that we believe maximizes long-term recurring cash flow per share which we consider the best long-term measure of shareholder value creation.
While we don't include this expected benefit from investments in our outlook it can be significant as I expect we'll have approximately $1.2 billion of cash to invest in 2012.
This $1.2 billion is comprised of the cash flow we expect to produce in the business and the debt capacity created from our expected growth in adjusted EBITDA if we maintain our current debt to EBITDA ratio.
I would currently expect that of this $1.2 billion we'll invest approximately $300 million in capital expenditures around the core business at high returns.
I would anticipate that the balance of the $1.2 billion or approximately $900 million to be available for acquisitions and to return cash to shareholders in the form of share purchases.
This $900 million represents over 7% of our current market capitalization and provides the opportunity for us to enhance our growth rates and maximize our long-term cash flow per share through acquisitions and share purchases.
I believe that this level of investment can add between 4% and 6% to our organic cash flow per share growth rate annually.
In summary we had an excellent third quarter as we continue to execute around our core business and I'm excited about the prospects for growth and investments as I look forward to 2012.
One final housekeeping note.
Many of you have asked me if we will begin to disclose funds from operations or commonly abbreviated FFO and adjusted funds from operations commonly abbreviated AFFO commensurate with American Towers' expected conversion to a REIT in 2012.
For the benefit of comparability we currently do expect to begin to report both FFO and AFFO in 2012.
And with that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
As Jay just mentioned we had an excellent third quarter exceeding our outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow.
With the 3 largest U.S.
carriers actively engaged in network upgrades we're enjoying a period of tremendous visibility to future revenue growth associated with these deployments.
AT&amp;T and Verizon continued their aggressive rollout of LTE and as the largest single provider of sites to Sprint we are benefiting from their accelerated deployment of Sprint's Network Vision plans as reflected in our results.
While most of our deployment activity comes from the largest 3 carriers we continue to expect that we will benefit as additional spectrum is deployed by other firms such as Dish Networks LightSquared Metro PCS and even perhaps a public safety network one day.
We believe that spectrum has the most value in the most densely populated areas and having the largest portfolio of towers in the most populated areas in the U.S.
we are uniquely positioned to facilitate the future deployment that may come to market through spectrum not yet deployed.
In addition this quarter our U.S.
Services business performed exceptionally well making its largest contribution to gross margin in our company's history as we continue to work very hard to meet customer deployment objectives and facilitate customers' installations on our sites.
Normally at this point in the call I take a moment to highlight some of the very powerful secular trends occurring in wireless that we're benefiting from.
No doubt I can spend the rest of the morning on how we see a world of smartphone penetration broadband wireless Internet usage driving a continuing need for investment in wireless infrastructure that gives us tremendous confidence in our future prospects.
But as consumers of wireless services I think you get it.
So instead I want to spend a minute on our long-term strategy which as shareholders or prospective shareholders we think it is important for you to understand.
We believe the U.S.
market is the most attractive wireless market in the world and provides plenty of opportunities for carriers to invest profitably and for Crown Castle to participate meaningfully in its future growth.
We believe that with the scale we have in the U.S.
market and our customer-focused approach we can provide more services to customers that facilitate speed and ease in their deployment process at attractive economic terms for us.
We take a long-term approach to the business as if it were our own and that means we make investments such as land purchases that have given us a unique ability to control our largest expense while also accelerating customer access to our sites.
We pair our customer-focused approach with the best assets in the industry as evidenced by the concentration of our sites in the top 100 markets the percentage of revenue from the big 4 carriers and the percentage of land ownership and term on our ground leases.
The combination of our customer-focused approach together with the best assets in the industry allows us to maximize the opportunity in the U.S.
market.
Lastly the final component of our long-term strategy is how we allocate capital.
We've been at this for years with the same basic template.
We seek to invest our significant and growing investment capacity in a way that we believe drives the highest recurring cash flow per share while at the same time improving the security and duration of that cash flow as we anticipate that cash flow quality and yield whether distributed or not will become an increasing component of value in the future.
Consider that since 2007 we have grown recurring cash flow per share 19% annually while materially reducing the risk profile of the business as we have discussed.
Further at current multiples the 2012 guidance that we're now providing you here at the end of October a year prior suggests almost 17% total return next year when considering the recurring cash flow yield on the current share price plus the 10% organic growth in the outlook.
We believe long term we will be valued on the cash flow distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends plus our growth prospects.
When considering the core growth in our business the quality of our cash flows and our current valuation I believe we compare very favorably to real estate and other infrastructure companies.
For at least a few more years I expect we'll be able to offset current income at the corporate level with net operating loss carryforwards from prior periods.
As such we intend to make the most of our flexibility by allocating our substantial investment capacity to acquisitions and purchases of our stock to maximize recurring cash flow per share within the strategy that I've outlined.
We are very proud of how we are positioned as a company and the significant confidence our customers have placed on us by allowing us to help them realize their network objectives in this very exciting time for wireless.
So in closing I'm very pleased with our results.
I'm very pleased with the progress we've made this year and look forward to the balance of the year.
With that operator we'd be happy to address some questions.
[Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.
Research Division</strong> Two if I could.
First of all on the land purchase this quarter of $89 million can you talk about how much you expect that to reduce run rate operating costs as essentially you capitalized the rent on that? And secondly on the Services business can you talk a little more about what you see in terms of carriers and activity if that's -- if carriers come up with new sites or it's upgrade-driven? Sure James.
On the first question and maybe it's helpful to clarify I think as you've identified all of the sites that we purchased that I referenced there in the transaction the single transaction were all ground leases under our own sites and were not third-party land leases and so the impact we will benefit from there is the land lease line and the direct cost of operations in the Site Rental business.
As I look forward to 2012 it's embedded in the outlook that we gave and so basically we believe almost all of our operating costs will be flat year-over-year a little bit of an increase from land leases but certainly this purchase helps offset what we would normally expect in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% escalation.
So in that sense I think what we'll basically do is pay for the normal escalation expense that we would have combined with the other purchases that we'll do during calendar year 2011.
On Services James thanks for that because it gives me an opportunity to recognize the tremendous effort that our team has made to continue to grow our Services opportunity and that's why increasing the take rate or the number of instances where we're actually involved with a carrier that's touching our site you’re an upgrade on a site or a new installation we're managing that installation.
We're also bringing that more value add sort of further upstream on the front end of their application process to include structural analyses zoning and permitting work and not just simply the management of the construction activity on the site.
So that's basically the nature of what's going on there and we think it provides the high-tech experience that we're excited about delivering with customers and allows us to control what's going on the site and really manage the sites better.
So very pleased with the effort we've demonstrated there.
Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
Research Division</strong> If I could turn to the 2012 guidance a couple of things.
First on the $90 million assumption I think you've talked for a little while about Sprint being much more active following the MLA.
So if Sprint's going to be very active in '12 were it not for most of '11 does that imply that we're seeing a little bit less from some of the other carriers or you're just being conservative talk around that? And then on the Alltel commentary perhaps you can just provide us a little bit more color there? And in particular is this it? Is there any other Alltel or other sort of churn that we would expect that should have the same sort of impact in the next year or 2? And beyond this on this? Sure Simon thanks for both questions.
With reference to the first question the $90 million of growth as you think about 2012 I think it's helpful to go back to our original comments and what we expected in the calendar year 2011.
When we began 2011 in the guidance that we gave for 2011 in the fall of 2010 our expectation was that all we were going to see in this calendar year meaning 2011 was activity from Verizon and AT&amp;T that they were going to make up the vast majority of the activity.
As we got into 2011 we actually saw Sprint accelerate the activity around Network Vision on our sites and began to see that during the third quarter and are seeing it in the fourth quarter of this year.
So the benefit -- and we -- obviously you can go back and see last quarter we significantly increased our expectation for calendar year 2011.
That was based in part on increases in the FX benefit that we were getting from Australia but the second large benefit was the activity we're seeing from Sprint.
As you look at our activity for 2012 the run rate we're assuming there is really where we've been for the second half of all of '11 and at the high end of the guidance it assumes most of basically the run rate we've gotten in the second half of 2011 and then we came off that a little bit obviously because we're so early.
It's October of '11 and we're trying to figure out what we think leasing will look like towards the end of 2012.
But at the high end of the guidance that is most of the run rate which would include the activity from Verizon Sprint and AT&amp;T for a full year 2012.
On your second question around Alltel I think most of the impact from Alltel we are going to see in 2012 and as we've tried to point out it's offsetting the benefit from escalations.
The benefit we would see absent churn from escalations in the calendar year 2012 would be about 2% of revenues.
Alltel is not the whole offset there.
We have normal churn in the business but it is a little bit higher than what we would normally see.
But importantly the activity in terms of churn if you think about number of licenses churned in the calendar year 2012 that's up about 10% from what we're experiencing in 2011 of which Alltel is a component in 2012.
But really the impact there is much greater than that.
It results in almost a 50% impact because that churn activity is heavily weighted towards the first half of 2012.
In fact it's about 75/25 in the case of Alltel.
So the impact there in terms of year-over-year growth from revenues is more impactful than the actual number of churn licenses and I think by the time we're done with 2012 we'll probably have gotten most of what we would expect to lose from Alltel out of the run rate.
Would not expect in 2013 and the years beyond to not have any churn but I think the components of -- the component being Alltel most of that would be gone.
Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just a couple of quick ones here.
You talked about your liquidity that you're forecasting I believe for 2012 the $1.2 billion and around $300 million will go into discretionary CapEx $900 million being available for other investments.
Could you just start off by providing what these numbers are in 2011 as we get some sort of relative change? Sure.
I think from a land purchase standpoint that's going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about $150 million.
Secondly the component around adding additional tenants to the site that will probably end up being somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million to $100 million.
And then the final component significant component would be the amount of capital that we put into new sites as we've spoken about over the last couple of quarters.
That activity is largely distributed antenna system deployments and that would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million maybe a little bit higher than that so that gets you pretty close to the $300 million.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And then for your guidance for next year it looks like you're just sort of assuming the same exchange rate that you're using for 2011 which I think is a bit conservative relative to current levels.
What’s sort of the rough math on if the prevailing exchange rate remained intact what that would do the quarterly revenues or annual revenues just so we can kind of run some sensitivities on that? Based on the current spot rate that would benefit about $5 million in revenue for the full year and $3 million to $4 million to EBITDA.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then one last question just on the modeling activity [ph] side...
Brett importantly I think if you're looking at calendar year '11 to calendar year '12 but we're assuming basically exactly the same exchange ratio in '12 in our outlook as we think actuals will look like in '11 so that 3% to 5% you've now made the periods non-comparable as you think through that.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just the last question here on modeling just to make sure I understand it right.
Because it seems like some of the churn is going to be a bit more front-end loaded this year relative to '11 and I think about sequentially modeling out quarters does that mean that sequential growth rates in say the first and second quarter would be somewhat minimal and then a lot of the revenue growth you would expect over the course of '12 would be in the third and fourth quarters? That's correct.
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Maybe just a couple of follow-ups.
First on the land deals we're seeing a number of them in 3Q.
I totally understand the strategic logic and sort of reducing the risk around the cost structure over time but I'm just wondering from your perspective the pace of activity in 3Q and what we saw what created that opportunity? Was it a different pricing environment from buying the land? Is it sort of a different level of a sense of urgency around taking it down amongst the different tower operators? Maybe some context there would be helpful.
And then second question just back to the Alltel buildup I guess a lot of us are kind of surprised to see that resurface at this point because if you look at A) what Alltel represented as a percent of your revenues when you went in the Verizon deal 3% to 4% so it's a pretty small manageable number; B) what we saw from Verizon cell site activity was a lot of decommissioning activity from 4Q '09 through the second quarter of 2010 and then it really leveled out.
So to see it resurface at this point maybe it just suggests that your assumption around renewal rates on the stuff that comes up for grabs next year has changed.
I just want to know a little more context around that.
Jason this is Ben.
On the land deals I'd say it's just opportunistic.
I mean if something came up we have an opportunity to purchase a number of sites in a single portfolio again all of them being sites that are under our towers and we look at it like just more of the same.
It's essentially 2 quarters' worth of activity we're able to pull into the third quarter.
I don't know that that will happen again.
We're continuing to work on the same page that we've been on the internal process as Jay mentioned somewhere in the vicinity of $150 million a year kind of run rate maybe $120 million a year run rate and we talked extensively about the progress we've made and what that does for the long-term attributes of the business.
So I think you'd understand that.
On the Alltel situation this is basically the churn we would have expected.
It took about 18 to 24 months for them to rationalize sites get fiber pulled to other sites.
This was sort of an ongoing process that was resident within Verizon on rationalizing sites then I wouldn't begin to speculate on what others had in their arrangements.
But this was part of a contracted termination arrangement on these sites as they go through and this is actually the churn that we've felt from the deal.
We didn't really have a whole lot when they did the deal.
This is the delayed impact of that as they go through and rationalize sites and pull fiber to other sites.
So again it's all in the context of the backdrop as it always is around -- if you consider the significant investment that Verizon is making on improving and upgrading sites around the [indiscernible] overlay on a net basis it's a tremendous gain in terms of revenue growth for us on the Verizon account.
It just so happens we're isolating this one negative event because it does actually move the numbers in 2012 as we've talked about but it's always important to keep in proper context what's going on in the entirety of Verizon undertaking.
And Jason I think you've correctly stated our exposure to Alltel back in the end of 2008 with about 3% of our revenues and the period of time of which you articulated that others have seen churn we did not see any churn from Alltel.
So maybe we just got an extra year or so of revenue and now experiencing some churn there.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And as you look at the lease expirations for Alltel what you guys have seen over time and the renewal percentage that actually surfaced on those leases what was it and what are you forecasting for next year? I think the churn that's embedded in -- as I talked about the total churn that's embedded is of about 2% of revenues of which Alltel is a component of that and we don't expect any additional churn from Alltel beyond 2012.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And everything expiring from Alltel you're pretty much assuming does nothing gets renewed and it would be an upside surprise if it does? No.
If your question is are we assuming that all of the Alltel leases are going to be canceled no we're not assuming that.
Is that what you're asking? Research Division</strong> I [ph] was asking if the renewal percentage over time you've got a certain amount of leases expiring from Alltel every year.
To be conservative I guess the approach would be let's just assume they do not get renewed but historically my sense is a good percentage of those actually did get renewed.
And so...
I understand what you're saying and it would not be that we're assuming 100% of their licenses get terminated just the ones that Verizon identified for us were not necessary going forward.
Our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> If I could just follow up on that theme with one more and then go back to the organic demand.
Just on this Alltel stuff Jay it sounds like it was a differentiating feature of your contractual relationship with Alltel that kind of allowed you to enjoy revenues for a longer period than others were able to and now we have this kind of cliff of churn.
So it seems like you've known about it for a couple of years but we're only finding out about it today.
Are there any more kind of skeletons in the closet with respect to the AT&amp;T-Dobson deal and your contract terms there or the Verizon-World Cellular deal and your other contract terms there or any other contract or any other relationship that could be kind of one of these cliff events that we find out about the day of? That would be helpful.
And then number two just going back again to clarify on the $90 million of new business expectations for next year I guess Ben you laid out a lot of the upsides into those.
We could add PCS has been talking about raising CapEx and Leap has been talking about raising CapEx but it doesn't appear that they're in the run rate today.
So is it therefore that as you set guidance today you're not including those kinds of intentions because they're not really in the visible pipeline today? David first of all on your Alltel question and the notion of a cliff let me talk to you with a little bit here.
First of all we're just not giving guidance for 2012 so we're not going to give you forward guidance for '13 '14 '15 or whatever else could happen out in the future.
So when we talk about the concept of a cliff let's keep it in proper context.
I think Jay's comments indicated that our total churn for 2012 is expected to be around 2%.
He also said that that's about 50% more by dollar amount than 2011 which would lead you to think that 2011 is about 1.3% 1.4% area.
So I hardly think that 60 70 basis points of churn is a cliff.
So let's just keep the numbers in proper context here.
With respect to what we're looking at in terms of forward guidance on revenue growth I think as Jay talked about we've got 3 active carriers going very actively on building out LTE or upgrading in the case of Network Vision.
That's in the numbers.
In terms of speculating on other upside other spectrum launches other things going on here at the end of October I think that would be really difficult for us to speculate on.
But Jay do you have anything more to add there? No.
I mean -- I guess there's always potential upside we saw outside in our Services business.
We're always reticent to project that for obvious reasons but it's early days and we're going to do the best we can to get all we can.
I think typically Dave has been our practice historically we wait until initiatives or intentions are funded before we would put it into our outlook and as my comments reflected earlier Verizon Sprint AT&amp;T that activity all looks like it's funded and it's running and so we based our outlook for next year on that.
Did not -- around other intentions that have been discussed which we did not include I think I'd have to put the network sharing arrangement between Sprint and LightSquared.
We didn't include any potential benefit from that in our 2012 outlook.
Research Division</strong> If I could just follow up and again just to kind of address this issue because we spent -- all of us have spent a lot of time talking about this Alltel question last night and why it showed up now and its impact in the rest of the industry could you maybe -- I'll ask the question in a different way.
Could you speak to whether this relationship that you had with Alltel that led to this particular event was unique to this Alltel relationship and therefore we can kind of look out into the future and we don't really necessarily have to budget for potential changes of this nature again? Is that fair? Dave I think what I would say is going back to the big picture comments that I made earlier we've made an effort over the last -- a concerted effort over the last several years to improve the quality of these relationships with the tenants and the duration of these contracts.
As we approach renewal dates which we laid out on one the slides for you to kind of show you what percentage of revenue's come up for renewal in multiple years sure there's always the possibility that tenants that renew.
Historically we've seen about 1% to 1.5% on an annual basis of churn.
Typically that churn is spread pretty equally throughout the course of the year.
As we sat down and looked at our 2012 outlook it appears that that churn as we noted from Alltel is going to be heavily weighted towards the first part of the year so it's about 75% in the first half and 25% in the back half.
So the impact of revenues is more severe than it would normally be.
Obviously by the time you get to the end of the year it doesn't matter at what point in time in the year that cancels.
From a run rate standpoint we'll end up looking like similar to previous years in the neighborhood of 1.5% of revenues that are churned but when you're comparing periods over periods then as Ben mentioned maybe we're picking up an extra 60 basis points or 70 basis points of impact from that.
In terms of your question about other carriers and consolidations and what impact that might have I think we've articulated these various mergers have been announced what the potential book case of those outcomes is and ultimately we won't know until the carriers get through the process of integrating.
And in the case of Alltel -- this is an excellent example.
Alltel was done back several years ago and it took 3 to 4 years before we actually saw the impact of the churn.
So it may be a while before we see and can quantify for you exactly what the impact of any of the combinations that have happened over time with the carriers would be.
Just one more final point on that just backing into some numbers here for you Dave about -- it looks like about 40% of our licenses ultimately churn on Alltel.
So if you go back to this 3% revenue kind of back into it it's about 40% would now come out.
It's happening actually in the latter part of this year and then all of next year.
And then I think it's always important to look at the context of what has Verizon done since 2009 around building out LTE and significant revenue opportunities significant investment in LTE and 4G to continue their market position and to which we and our peers have all been a great beneficiary of.
So while you do have some churn that you can isolate in a particular period the overall picture is significantly positive if you look at revenue growth and that continues even with this churn in the numbers.
It continues into 2012.
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
Research Division</strong> So first question is so it sounds like you want to give AFFO and FFO details for next year.
Does that infer that you're going to provide straight-line impacts to revenue and costs? And if so can you give us an update maybe on where that is today? The second question that I have for you guys was really just around -- if you look at the third quarter and the second quarter and you look at the reported revenue growth rates that you provided can you give us the breakdown of what was from the we'll call increased occupancy versus what was the combination of escalation churn in a straight line in terms of the growth rates? I think in the first quarter of '11 by example you mentioned it was roughly 7% from increased occupancy year-over-year growth that you got.
Can you just give us a baseline of what 2Q and 3Q were in terms of the growth rates there? Sure.
On your first question Mike we do expect in our AFFO metric to highlight our line item the impact from straight-line rent and straight-line rental expense so it'd be both the revenue and the expense.
I think roughly for the full year 2011 and you can kind of get to this by doing -- looking at the cash flow statement.
Somewhere in -- a little over 90% more than that possibly of the RCF [recurring cash flow] that was produced in the calendar year 2011 will be cash so it's in that area and certainly...
Less than 10% non-cash.
Less than 10% of it would be non-cash.
In answer to the second question I don't know that I have right in front of me the components of the growth in the quarter.
I think it was potentially your question.
I think I've laid out in my comments that for the full year it was about 5% and 4% and I believe that that's very similar for each of the quarters during the year that we'll get -- in the back half of this year that we'll get somewhere in the neighborhood of about 5% and 4% from the benefit of -- 5% being the additional equipment and about 4% being the benefit from escalations.
You can see on the page that we laid out on Slide 12 that from a dollar amount standpoint the benefit that we received to the GAAP revenues was about $60 million.
Research Division</strong> And did you qualify for '12 whether you said that will be a front-end loaded or back-end loaded year in terms of the new equipment? We didn't answer that question.
From a churn standpoint it's obviously significantly front-end loaded so from a net leasing standpoint it will certainly be back-end loaded.
From a leasing standpoint it's probably going to be somewhat back-end loaded as well.
Our next question comes from the line of Clay Moran with Benchmark Capital.
LLC Research Division</strong> Two questions.
Can you tell us for the 2012 guidance what does it imply for cash revenue growth I guess somewhat similar to the last questions? And then second question you did mention also on the 2012 outlook that it does not assume any significant license extensions.
Is that something you're considering currently? I would think that the Global Signal contracts would be up soon so are you looking at doing a sizable lease extension? Clay on your first question by implication is as you look at the growth the fact that all of the growth is coming from leasing activity I think the majority of that revenue growth is going to be cash and as you...
[indiscernible] Virtually all of it.
As we get into the year and you can look at the FFO metric and we'll be able to analyze that and give you -- you can see it precisely.
On the second question as we laid out the next 5 years there's roughly 36% of the tenant licenses that are going to come up for renewal.
Those are spread ratably and I would suspect that you will see us go through the process of renewing those as they come up.
If we have an opportunity to move some of that forward we may take that opportunity do so but I wouldn't necessarily want to give you any guidance on that.
As we noted in our outlook we're not assuming that we pull forward any of those licenses from future periods and do any sizable renewals in the calendar year 2012 but as we get into the year if we decide to do that we'll certainly tell you.
Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.
Research Division</strong> A few questions if I may.
First in terms of Alltel Verizon if I could follow up on Brett's question we're running through the numbers in our model and I just want to understand because our model is pointing to potential here for sequential declines in site rental revenue so a little more color around that would be great.
Secondly on tower sites you continue to decommission sites and to kind of rationalize your cost structure.
It's definitely had a positive impact on the margin side.
As we look out longer term we have been modeling site expansion or tower expansion.
Could you give us some color on what the company's kind of plans are regarding that? And then finally the company has previously targeted 15% to 20% recurring free cash flow per share growth.
Right now from midpoint to midpoint on your recurring free cash flow in absolute terms your guidance applies about 8% year-over-year growth which would point to call it $650 million to $750 million of share buybacks to get into that 15% range.
Is 15% to 20% still the company goal? On your first question Jonathan we're not going to give guidance by quarter for 2012 but we're not expecting sequential declines in site rental revenue as we get into calendar year 2012.
I think we'll have sequential increases.
I think certainly the amount of those increases as we move from Q4 to Q1 2012 those will be less than what we would expect in the back half of the year as we move from Q2 to Q3 and Q3 on to Q4 as a result of the churn that we've talked about in our previous comments.
Research Division</strong> Understood.
On the site decommissioning Jonathan I'd say that's a fairly minor activity and not something that's going to have a significant impact.
We're obviously rationalizing some sites.
And then in terms of adding new sites we're always in the market.
We've done a few acquisitions this year.
I would like to see us add assets and further be able to leverage some talent that we're delivering on the operating side of the business today but we're only going to do that where we're confident it can generate a return that's in excess of frankly what we can get to buy [ph] our own stock.
And that's always the opportunity cost dilemma that we'd put ourselves through around here and a lot of days frankly the acquisition doesn't prevail.
But we love for it to and we'd like to find other assets to acquire but only on the disciplined approach that we've talked about.
And then that leads us to sort of your RCF per share growth question.
As you saw from this year 2011 this fourth quarter guidance would suggest we're going to do 18% coming off the string of -- from 2007 where we spent about 19% I guess as we said [ph] all the way through 2011.
So we're very pleased with that.
And going forward as I look out the organic growth of about 10% recurring cash flow on the current share count which you have to look at and then the current cash we have available in terms of cash flow of about a 7% yield today chances are if history is any guide we'll end up using part of that to shrink the share count and part of it to add assets again based on this methodology and relative value that we've always focused on.
And so it's our expectation that you should still be able to count on sort of midteens growth if we're putting that cash flow to work properly and that's our expectation.
It's very clear to me that at some point in the future and that's probably at the longest when we burn off our net operating losses we'll be a significant dividend payer -- and likely a REIT structure.
It's very difficult to find an example of a model where you can otherwise take out and not incur corporate income tax level where that doesn't ultimately prevail and the prevailing school of thought is we will convert to a REIT once it efficient to do so when we burned off NOLs.
So we are very focused as a management team on the notion that there is a date certain and the longest time when that is is when you burn off NOLs.
It could actually be sooner when we're going to be valued on the dividend approach and growth.
And so anything we spend capital on whether it be buying shares or buying assets we are focused on driving that distributor cash flow per share as high as we possibly can and I think it's important to think about Crown Castle as having somewhat of a unique window of time of flexibility where we can put this capital to work in the most productive way before we lock ourselves in to a dividend approach which will be ultimately a fairly significant dividend in all likelihood because of the tax depreciation and the rapid pace that it burns off.
The necessary cash that's distributable at that point in time to eliminate the net income in the REIT looking out a few years will probably be a very significant component of our free cash flow.
So anyway that's really how we're thinking about it.
I would say that my objectives are still sort of mid to high teens.
We've done that here in the most recent year and there's been no change in that view going forward.
Research Division</strong> That's very helpful.
Just a follow-up on that can you give us an update on where your NOLs stand? They may be higher than we could calculate on our own given the opportunity.
Did you take advantage of accelerated depreciation? Our number's about $2 billion currently so it's not moved much and our current planning is that we'll burn that off in the neighborhood of 2015.
And as we've talked about in the past we would expect the REIT conversion to come about somewhere in the neighborhood of the beginning of 2016.
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> First applaud thank you AFFO has been a long time coming.
Glad to see it being reported.
Really appreciate that.
Can you give us the guidance in 2012 in an AFFO basis to a kind of the percentage like you gave for '11? Not yet not yet.
But we will.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> But again -- major item I think it's been an issue with the stock I think it's been an issue with REIT investors as they look at it and say "We need to see AFFO in a straight line it's very important so appreciate that." Second question is in your 2012 guidance how much Service business is assumed there? Is it kind of this really significant level we've seen in the last couple of quarters? Does it revert back to a lower level? Sure Rick.
We've assumed for the full year '12 a level similar to what we would expect for full year '11 so the contribution there is a little over $60 million is what we're expecting for 2012.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And in regards to how you'll book the Sprint MLA should we assume that the lease extensions happen on a site-by-site basis and your revenue guidance includes the fact that you have the extension GAAP math working out just on an as-touched basis? I don't know that we want to specifically get into how the contractual terms of our leases work with any one of our customers.
We talked about last quarter as Sprint announced the transaction that we have done with them that it's an activity-related contract so as -- we will receive rent and revenues from them as they go out and touch the sites for Network Vision but I think beyond that I'll be quiet about how the contract works.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Sure.
And one final question on the land deal the one-time purchase of -- so was that from one owner? Can you update us about how many of your land sites are owned by somebody that owns more than a site after this transaction? In other words how much concentration is in post-transaction? Sure.
This is one owner one other transaction and in terms of what's out there that's been aggregated I'm aware of about 100 sites than one owner stands [ph] and Jay there's one more right? Smaller? I think about 70...
About 70 and another one and that's it as far as we're aware.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And how many was in this one? We haven't disclosed that because for obvious competitive reasons we're in the market buying every day.
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> The one thing I wanted to get back to was on the services side and this was asked a little bit earlier but can you just remind us of how the sort of contracts in your Services business work how much lead time do you have on those how much do you need to -- ability do you have to staff up with more demand? And just help us think about the visibility in that business.
Yes Phil.
We get about -- I'd say we get really good visibility 3 months out and there's always variability in there and fortunately it's been running in our favor.
So when our guys come in with their forecast fortunately for all of us they've been sort of hitting the high end of their forecast every quarter and we've become quite accustomed to that if they're listening.
But nonetheless it's about 3 months.
So when you get out 6-months period you've got a pipeline and you've certainly got an expectation and we've got a pretty good track record of delivering.
But we get very cautious beyond about that period although I would add to the fact that we've gotten better at the take rate we've gotten better at sort of predicting what we're likely to see from the application volume and by customer so we know what we're doing by customer and which regions of the country we're more engaged in which we still have some work to do.
So we're able to make ever-increasing probably better forecasts around what that level of activity will be.
But it's not a precise science and it has been cutting our way lately which I'm quite happy to say but again it's not always assured and could have some variability in it.
Research Division</strong> So I think this was asked earlier but can you talk about what sort of the guidance implies just for services year-over-year and what the...? Yes.
We're actually assuming about flat contribution for '12 versus '11 and so that's not insignificant.
That's moving pretty good.
And so that's the confidence we have in the team and obviously we're going to work very hard to deliver it.
I think we're right on the hour.
I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today and your continued interest in Crown Castle and look forward to finishing the year and we'll talk to you on the year end results probably toward the end of January.
So thanks again.

In addition today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA recurring cash flow recurring cash flow per share funds from operations funds from operations per share adjusted funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations per share.
Tables reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures are available under the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.
With that I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Thank you Fiona and good morning everyone.
We had a great 2011 and we are excited about the leasing activity we are seeing in our portfolio.
Let me quickly summarize some of our accomplishments during the year and then I'll take you through some greater detail.
Throughout 2011 we consistently delivered results above our original expectation.
And we ended 2011 delivering another very strong quarter of results.
For the full year as shown on Slide 3 we posted growth in site rental revenue of 9% site rental gross margin of 11% adjusted EBITDA of 12% and adjusted funds from operations per share of 17% compared to 2010.
These results were considerably above our expectations at the beginning of 2011.
Further our services business continues to outperform our expectations delivering strong growth in 2011 as we continue to work very hard to meet customer deployment objectives and facilitate customers' installations on our sites.
In addition to our strong organic leasing results we announced several important acquisitions.
In December 2011 we announced an agreement to acquire NextG Networks for $1 billion which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2012.
NextG is the leading provider of distributed antenna systems or DAS.
This acquisition puts us in the leadership position in providing small-cell solutions to our customers in addition to our existing leadership position in U.S.
towers.
We believe that DAS will make a meaningful contribution to site rental revenue growth in the next several years as these and other small-cell solutions become an increasingly important part of the wireless infrastructure complementing our existing macro towers.
Then we'll talk more about why we are excited about this investment later in the call.
Further earlier this month we announced the agreement to acquire 2 300 Ground Lease Related Assets from Wireless Capital Partners or WCP an immediately accretive acquisition.
We expect to close WCP in the first quarter of 2012.
Relative to other potential investments we believe that both of these acquisitions will be accretive to our long-term growth rate and enhancing the shareholder value.
Further we recently announced that we are seeking to refinance our credit facility with a new $3.1 billion credit facility.
The proceeds of the new facility are expected to be used to finance the NextG and WCP acquisitions and to finance our existing -- refinance our existing credit facility.
We expect to close the transaction later this month with approximately $1 billion of undrawn revolver availability after the aforementioned acquisitions and refinancing.
I would also highlight as you saw from our press release yesterday we began providing funds from operations or FFO and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO metrics which I'll walk you through shortly.
With that let me turn to Slide 4 as I highlight some of the results for the fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter we generated site rental revenue of $471 million up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues less cost of operations was $351 million up 8% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $335 million up 8% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
It is important to note that these growth rates were achieved almost entirely through organic growth on assets that we owned as of January 1 2011 as revenue growth from acquisitions was negligible.
AFFO which I will describe in more detail later was $193 million up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2010 or $0.68 per share up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2010 as shown on Slide 5.
There were no significant non-recurring items in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Turning to the balance sheet we ended 2011 pro forma for the acquisitions on our new credit facility with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 6x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of approximately 3x.
Pro forma both our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and cash interest expense coverage ratio are comfortably within their respective debt covenants requirements.
Moving on to investments and liquidity.
We expect to close on our new credit facilities on January 31 with the blended coupon based on current LIBOR of approximately 3.7% on the $2.1 billion of funded term loan.
In addition we expect to have $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity.
This gives us tremendous flexibility for investing activities that we expect will enhance long-term AFFO per share which we expect -- which we believe is the best long-term measure of shareholder value creation.
During the fourth quarter we invested $104 million as illustrated on Slide 6 including $83 million on capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $33 million on our land purchase program.
In total during 2011 we extended over 1 200 land leases and purchased land beneath more than 600 of our towers.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 76% of our gross margin up from 70% a year ago.
In fact today 38% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own up from 34% a year ago.
Further the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years.
Having completed over 11 000 land transactions we believe this activity has resulted in the most secure land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease expiration.
We continue to believe this is an important endeavor that provides a long-term benefit as it protects our margins and controls our largest operating expense.
Further our recent acquisition of the ground leases from WCP which are predominantly under our customers' towers allows us to apply the expertise we have gained as the industry leader in land lease extension and purchase.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we spend $9 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $41 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures the latter consisting of $28 million on existing sites and $13 million on the construction of new sites.
During the fourth quarter the acquisitions I previously discussed replaced our share purchase activity.
For the full year 2011 we purchased 7.7 million common shares and potential shares spending $318 million.
Since 2003 we have spent $2.7 billion to purchase approximately 100 million of our common shares and potential shares at an average price of $26.85 per share.
Also in January we announced the conversion of the remaining $305 million of our 6.25% convertible preferred stock which will result in the issuance of 8.3 million common shares and eliminate an annual dividend of approximately $19 million.
For the full year 2011 as illustrated on Slide 7 and 8 of the presentation site rental revenues were approximately $1.9 billion up 9% from the full year 2010.
Approximately 5% of the growth was attributable to the additional tenant equipment added to our sites reflecting the strong leasing activity we enjoyed in 2011.
And approximately 4% of the growth came from the existing base of business that was in place at the beginning of 2011 through contracted escalators and renewal of tenant leases net of any churn.
Site rental gross margin grew 11% from the full year 2010 to $1.4 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2011 was $1.3 billion up 12% from the full year 2010 and AFFO per share increased 17% from the full year 2010 to $2.58 for the full year 2011.
I would note that due to our rigorous control on cost in 2011 approximately 90% of the growth in site rental revenue found its way to site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to Slide 9 while we are only a month into 2012 we are seeing encouraging signs of the continued growth fueled largely by AT&amp;T and Verizon overlaying 4G networks and Sprint actively deploying their Network Vision program.
In our full year 2012 outlook we have not included the expected impact from our acquisitions of WCP and NextG or our $3.1 billion credit facility.
We would expect to include the impact of these in our quarterly earnings announcement following each respective closing.
We expect site rental revenue growth in 2012 of approximately $90 million wholly comprised of new leasing activity in the form of amendments to existing installations and brand-new installations on our site.
This is in line with the growth in organic leasing we have enjoyed since approximately 2007.
We expect the vast majority of this revenue in 2012 to come from Verizon AT&amp;T and Sprint.
As shown in our outlook on Slide 10 we expect AFFO growth of approximately 11% in 2012.
We would expect to augment this growth through opportunistic investment of cash flow and activities such as share purchases tower acquisitions new site construction and land purchases.
Even with our recent acquisition announcements we expect to have significant cash to invest in activities that we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share growth.
During 2012 we expect to generate approximately $810 million of AFFO and invest approximately $325 million on capital expenditures related to purchases of land beneath our towers the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites including distributed antenna systems.
In addition if we were to leverage at 5x our expected growth in adjusted EBITDA we would have an additional approximately $400 million to invest.
In total this is approximately $1.2 billion of investment capacity for 2012.
Ignoring our borrowing capacity the portion of our AFFO after expected capital expenditures represents a little over $100 million per quarter of cash flow that we could invest in activities related to our core business including purchases of our shares and acquisition.
Consistent with our past practice we are focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize that measure long-term AFFO per share.
I believe that this level of capital investment can add between 4% and 6% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate annually.
Before I turn the call over to Ben I would like to walk you through our new financial metrics as outlined on Slide 11.
As you've seen from our press release we began providing FFO and AFFO metrics this quarter with the aim to provide additional transparency and a comparable metric to others in the tower industry and a broader REIT universe.
We continue to expect that we will convert to a REIT no later than the exhaustion of our net operating losses which we currently expect to consume by approximately 2016.
During the second half of 2011 we began some of the preliminary work that will be necessary to make the conversion of this tax efficient capital structure in the future.
While we've not made a decision to convert to a REIT we do believe it is a likely outcome given the current tax efficiency of the structure.
As such we decided to provide the same AFFO metrics used by our peer American Tower.
For the first time in the history of the tower industry there will be a metric that is calculated the same across multiple tower companies.
I am hopeful that this definition of AFFO will become the metric that investors will use when evaluating companies in the tower industry.
I believe the metric is indicative of the dividend capacity of our industry and applaud American Tower for leading the way in defining the metric last quarter.
As many of you know FFO and AFFO are widely used in the REIT industry.
Long term we believe it will be important for REIT and other investors to be able to evaluate Crown Castle on this basis.
And by initiating the use of these metrics now we will hopefully demonstrate the long-term stability and growth of our business through good and bad economic periods.
Similar to our past practice of discussing recurring cash flow or RCF on a per-share basis we will focus the majority of our value creation discussion on AFFO per share.
Certainly we will be making our capital allocation decisions based on our goal of maximizing long-term AFFO per share.
To aid the transition to this metric we have provided the FFO and AFFO metrics for the full years from 2007 through 2011 with quarterly details for 2010 and 2011 in the supplement we posted along with our earnings release yesterday.
I would also note that cumulatively our new AFFO metrics would have yielded essentially the same results as our historical RCF metric since 2007.
As noted the cumulative difference between AFFO and RCF from 2010 through 2012 is only $14 million less than 0.5% of the $3.7 billion of recurring cash flow over these periods.
Our AFFO metric will provide more specificity with regards to straight-line revenue straight-line expense and non-cash interest expense.
The impact of these 3 items largely offset one another over the last 5 years.
As adopted our AFFO metric adjusts for the impact of straight-line revenues and expenses.
As I've mentioned in the past we've been able to recognize site rental revenues in advance of the cash received from our customers due to the extension of contracts with our customers.
In fact our revenue growth from 2009 through 2011 benefited by approximately 150 to 200 basis points per year from lease renewals.
We have been very successful and we're working with our customers to extend the terms of our contracts.
Over the past 3 years we've been able to renew and extend approximately 45% of our customer contracts with initial terms of up to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant.
Due to these long-term customer contracts with fixed escalations we've been recognizing site rental revenues in advance of the contracted cash payments from our customers in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Also we have been recognizing higher site rental expense than actual cash rental payment as a result of renewing our ground leases with fixed escalation for long periods of time.
As shown on Slide 12 we have graphed all of our existing leases both our revenue tenant leases and our expense ground leases for years 2012 through 2020 showing the expected reported amount and the respective cash receipts and payments.
As shown we expect that at the beginning that in the beginning into -- in about 2015 our cash receipts from tenant leases will exceed the amount of reported site rental revenue.
For purposes of generating the graphs we have assumed that all leases are renewed at term end dates.
As illustrated in the graphs and based on the aforementioned assumptions we expect that our cash receipts from our existing tenant licenses will grow at approximately 3.6% per annum for years 2012 to 2020.
We have made no assumptions in the graphs with regards to additional tenant leases tenant amendments or land purchases.
We hope that you will find our additional disclosure in the adoption of an industry -- of industry standard metrics helpful in your analysis.
To aid in the transition to AFFO and FFO from our current metric RCF we will continue to provide the RCF metric through the end of 2012.
In summary we had a terrific 2011 with a number of significant accomplishments and I'm very excited about 2012 as we continue to execute around our core business integrate NextG and continue to allocate capital to enhance long-term AFFO per share.
And with that I'm happy to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning.
We've got a lot to cover and as you can imagine there's been a lot going on at Crown Castle.
I want to take a couple of minutes to reflect on the tremendous year we had on a number of fronts.
As Jay just mentioned we had an excellent fourth quarter and finished the year very strong growing site rental revenue adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by 9% 12% and 17% respectively.
In addition to a strong year of site leasing our U.S.
Services business performed exceptionally well.
This success results from a diligent effort to capture more of the revenue opportunities associated with assisting our customers in locating or upgrading installations on our sites.
This increase in services activity is attributable to the confidence our customers have in Crown Castle through our disciplined and routine execution as regularly expressed in our customer surveys that consistently rank us as delivering the highest customer satisfaction in the industry.
As I look out to 2012 and beyond I'm as excited about the prospects for our business as in any time in my memory.
Wireless data demands on these networks continue unabated.
We have each of Verizon AT&amp;T and Sprint actively upgrading their networks which is driving significant revenue growth on our sites.
Further we see renewed activity from T-Mobile as they react to remaining independent and seek to improve coverage capacity and the economics of their network.
Beyond the immediate demand we see we believe longer term we will benefit from new partnerships and applications yet to be identified that bring additional spectrum to the market with the need for our sites.
It is the realization that we can extend our shared infrastructure model to assist customers in meeting these challenges that has led us to our decision to take a market-leading role in the DAS or small-cell site architecture business through our announced acquisition of NextG Networks.
I'm excited to spend a few minutes with you this morning sharing my enthusiasm with you about walking through our thought process and why we believe this investment uniquely positions Crown Castle for the future and why we believe this transaction will be accretive to our growth rates and shareholder value.
As mentioned by AT&amp;T on their call this morning as demand for data services accelerates network architecture is expanding.
And increasingly we believe DAS will be an important complement to traditional tower installations.
The acquisition of NextG furthers our capabilities in DAS enabling us to provide more shared wireless infrastructure for customers beyond those areas served by traditional towers thereby augmenting our service offering in this growing market.
NextG is the leading provider of DAS with over 7 000 nodes on the air and a further 1 500 nodes under construction.
Consistent with our focus on the top 100 BTAs in the U.S.
over 90% of NextG's nodes are in urban and suburban locations with 80% in the top 10 U.S.
metropolitan areas including New York Los Angeles Chicago Dallas-Fort Worth.
The NextG assets are expected to provide significant growth as they currently average only 1.25 tenants per network.
Following the contemplated acquisition we expect to be the largest independent operator of DAS systems in the U.S.
with approximately 10 000 nodes including 26 venues in over 20 university campuses in operation or under construction.
Based on existing and contracted networks under construction we expect the acquisition of NextG to have approximately $50 million of annualized run rate site rental gross margin when complete.
At closing we expect NextG to have approximately $17 million of annualized run rate G&amp;A costs.
The G&amp;A costs are largely associated with developing and building new sites and leasing the existing networks.
We consider these development costs to be an investment in building new systems currently under construction and do not expect material benefit from synergies until 2013.
I expect that as we work through the integration of NextG we will achieve cost synergies no doubt but we will go slow at achieving these synergies as we want to ensure that we don't stifle the growth opportunity that we believe we can achieve in the DAS market.
This acquisition is about scale capability and growth and I don't want to spoil that opportunity with shortsighted cost synergies.
In fact I believe that this acquisition has the potential to deliver adjusted EBITDA of 5x to 6x its current level in 5 years based on the commitment we believe wireless carriers are making to utilizing small-cell site solutions.
Similar to the towers we acquired from the carriers a decade or so ago these are largely single tenant assets that have tremendous lease-up potential.
In fact we've enjoyed much faster lease-up on our existing DAS portfolio compared to the tower lease-up rate where it took a decade or so to reach an average tenancy of 3 carriers per tower.
Our existing DAS networks are tracking to reach this level of tenancy much faster than what we saw on our traditional tower business and we have high expectations NextG systems will perform similarly well.
There are many parallels and similarities between DAS and our existing tower business and there are a few differences.
Let me take you through a few of the key questions that we had to answer before we were willing to make a $1 billion investment in DAS.
First is DAS a necessary component of the wireless infrastructure solution? Second does DAS have similar barriers to entry that our towers enjoy? And third is DAS similar enough to our existing infrastructure business to leverage our expertise and relationships? The resounding answer to all 3 of these questions is a yes and let me walk you through some of our conclusions.
We have included some slides to help facilitate this discussion.
As most of you are aware towers currently serve as the primary infrastructure solution for wireless communications.
As the usage of wireless devices increase there's an increasing need for small-cell architecture to help improve coverage but more importantly to help increase capacity in areas that can't be served by towers.
Industry estimates suggest there could be as many as 6 to 10 small cells deployed for each macro cell tower site over the long term as carriers add capacity to meet consumer demand.
We are still in the early stages of this infrastructure similar to where we were with towers a decade ago.
In fact the opportunity we see feels a lot like the early tower days of the late '90s.
Since 2003 we have gradually gained expertise in this area starting internally with a small-cell site -- a small DAS deployment team in specialized areas with minimal investment.
As these early systems gained traction and carrier buy-in we made a $115 million investment in DAS by acquiring NewPath networks in September of 2010.
Since then we've enjoyed significant growth in DAS from this relatively small acquisition.
As a result we began to look for ways to leverage on a larger scale what we learned from our NewPath acquisition and our carrier relationships and so we pursued NextG with the aim to become the largest operator of DAS networks in the U.S.
and secure locations that would be nearly impossible to replicate.
Like the early days of the tower industry we believe the best assets are likely to be the first ones constructed in the most densely populated areas of the U.S.
As illustrated in Slide 13 DAS networks are in many ways similar to a tower simply laid on its side.
Simply put DAS is a network of antennas connected by fiber to a communications hub designed to facilitate wireless communication services for multiple operators.
We rent space on our individual DAS antenna locations or nodes via long-term contracts.
These contracts are generally at least 10 years in term with renewal options and annual escalation features.
Similar to our towers DAS can accommodate multiple customers for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of signals for wireless communication devices.
Typically a DAS network will consist of nodes or antennas mounted on utility poles streetlamps or traffic signals connected by fiber to a base station radio in a remote location.
The fiber routes are typically a combination of aerial cables strung pole to pole along a street or a cable buried in a conduit.
On Slides 14 through 17 there are pictures of some completed DAS solutions.
It may be helpful to talk about DAS in the context of towers.
In our traditional tower business we are responsible for building and maintaining the steel tower structure and renting ground space from the tower -- and renting -- and renting the ground on which the tower is located.
In DAS we are responsible for building and owning underground or aerial fiber for multiple tenants utilizing the public right-of-way and locating antennas on streetlamps traffic light or utility poles.
The fiber component of a DAS installation is akin to the galvanized steel in a traditional tower.
That is what we own and lease to customers in its most simple form.
As in the traditional tower business the wireless carrier is typically responsible for operating their base station equipment.
Economically a good rule of thumb is to think of a tower as roughly equivalent to 3 DAS nodes.
So our portfolio pro forma of 10 000 DAS nodes including those under construction relates to approximately 3 000 towers.
To help frame it for you you can think of the cost of a node as 1/3 the cost of a typical tower and the rent we receive as 1/3 of the rent we would receive for a typical tower installation.
As in towers the incremental margins on adding additional tenants are very high as the cost associated with adding tenants are negligible or subsidized by the additional tenant.
A DAS can typically accommodate up to 5 tenants.
The landlord is usually the municipality or a local utility company.
The recurring rent associated with DAS can vary widely depending on the location cost and complexity of the system.
But typically the rent is approximately 1/3 of a typical tower lease.
Importantly as in the tower model this is a shared infrastructure model and is a cost effective solution for wireless carriers when compared to the cost of owning the assets themselves and our return expectations are achieved through co-location.
Examples of DAS we have installed include sports venues such as stadiums and arenas where thousands of people are trying to utilize their smartphones to surf the Internet.
Similarly university students are typically early adopters of new communications technologies and mobile phones are no exception.
Following the acquisition of NextG we will have over 20 universities to offer wireless carriers access via a shared DAS network and these networks deliver excellent indoor and outdoor campus coverage in lecture halls dormitories and sports venues.
Further in communities particularly suburban and urban areas where there isn't space for towers or where zoning restrictions or space limit the construction of towers we have developed DAS solutions by attaching small antennas and small equipment cabinets on existing utility poles or light poles.
After combining with NextG systems -- the NextG systems with our own we will have DAS deployed in marquee locations such as the University of Notre Dame Stanford University Hilton Head Island Colonial Williamsburg Amway Center high-end suburban locations such as Scottsdale Arizona dense urban environments like Manhattan and San Francisco and some of the most recognizable theme parks in the world.
In short I am thrilled about the portfolio of DAS networks we are acquiring and the talented people we expect will be joining Crown Castle.
They will play an important role as we continue to grow and expand our small-cell site capability to deal with network capacity needs of the future.
So to wrap up and go to questions we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results and believe they demonstrate the quality of our assets combined with our ability to execute for our customers.
We remain disciplined and focused on maximizing long-term AFFO per share through growing our core business and making opportunistic investments and we have significant capacity to continue to do this in 2012.
And finally I'm excited we have positioned the company to be the clear leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
with unique capabilities to meet the current and future needs of our customers.
With that operator I'll be pleased to turn the call over for questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> First on the AFFO again thanks for that detail.
We've seen a strong performance out of American Tower.
Obviously there's incremental investor demand I guess not just from REIT investors but other income investors.
How are you thinking about waiting for all the NOLs to expire.
I know you addressed that a little bit earlier versus maybe getting ready to move a little bit quicker if things change over time? And paying a dividend as a C Corp.
And then if you could comment on any potential interest in T-Mobile towers as well that would be great.
Sure.
Simon I'll take the first couple of those and let Ben take the last one on T-Mobile.
With regards to where we are as I mentioned in my comments we expect to exhaust the net operating losses in about 2015 2016 and would expect that no later than that date we would convert to a REIT.
Obviously given the tax efficiency of the current structure as a REIT we would benefit from not having to pay any taxes and would expect to take advantage of that at least in our current planning before we would become a taxpayer at the corporate level.
With regards to doing that early I think that's an evaluation we will continue to make on an ongoing basis and look at what we think the value of converting early is.
As I mentioned we've begun to do some of the preliminary work that would be necessary for us to do that and depending on kind of our forward view we may choose to accelerate ahead of a 2015 or 2016 date or we may ultimately decide to stay as we're organized as a C Corp.
With regards to paying a dividend before converting to a REIT as we've talked about in the past look I think this is an opportunity for us to think about as we have historically the allocation of capital.
And to date we spent about $2.7 billion returning cash to shareholders in the form of share purchases.
And as we currently think about allocation of capital that's our preference.
However we'll continue to entertain the opportunity of potentially translating that transferring that return of cash to shareholders in the form of share purchases and may ultimately decide to do it in the form of a dividend.
But I think therein lies a significant amount of flexibility.
So as we think about flexibility and allocation of capital the flexibility of being able to choose at this point whether to pay a dividend or not and having the NOL covered we think is a valuable asset in addition as I talked about in my comments having a significant amount of availability under a revolver either pursue share purchases or acquisition.
I think we've got a tremendous amount of flexibility and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go.
Just to punctuate one thing I think we think the outside when we used the NOLs probably 4 years and we think that's the most efficient structure as Jay mentioned but we've got a lot of flexibility and we don't want to give that up casually.
So we're going to think very we carefully about how we do that.
Simon you asked about the T-Mobile towers.
I think we've all been reading the same press reports and I understand that potentially there's  a consideration of them coming back on the market.
You would expect us to be interested in taking a look at the asset.
We certainly expect to do that but I will tell you we will be very disciplined about how we think about the value of the asset.
We've got a lot on our plate.
We are extremely excited as I mentioned in my remarks about the growth prospects we have in front of us as a company really positioned for the future and so we'll certainly take a look at any tower asset out there including this one but I would expect us to be pretty disciplined in our review.
And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> Just 2 things if I could.
First just with respect to kind of where the leverage is now Jay on the business I think if this has been a year or a year and a half ago you'd probably continue to talk about de-leveraging being a priority.
If you could kind of revisit kind of where you stand in that context now.
And then maybe Ben AT&amp;T we just ended the call where they talked about now that the T-Mobile deal's off the table they're going to restart a cell-splitting exercise and a DAS initiative that they intend to fund into 2012.
I was wondering based on your agreement with AT&amp;T how do -- under what circumstances can you monetize those kinds of new spending from AT&amp;T and have you already been approached by them? Sure Dave on the first question around leverage.
We've talked about our target as being 4x to 6x and the great benefit we have in this business is that it de-leverages very quickly given the organic growth in the assets.
And given our view of the acceleration of growth relative to traditional towers that we expect around NextG that's going to be increasing the speed at which we would expect a normal course of the balance sheet to de-lever.
So I think we'll continue to operate in the target.
I think that this transaction that we just did illustrates the value of the flexibility that we created by running a little bit lower leverage and operating at the midpoint of our target range.
So we're approximately going towards the end of 2011 we had approximately 5 turns of leverage and we spent a lot of time talking about our target leverage of potentially being willing to go up to 6x for the right asset.
And as we looked at these 2 assets that became available in the back half of 2011 we were able to invest $1.5 billion in assets we think are growth enhancing strategic and very important to the next generation of wireless.
We were able to do that without issuing a single share of stock.
And so we look at the value of the flexibility and would say about these acquisitions this is exactly why we were operating the balance sheet that we were.
I would further say this is why I am excited about having $1 billion revolver because I think the revolver which we expect to have a 5-year term obviously I'll expect a balance sheet and would expect the normal course of the balance sheet will de-lever some over time not through the pay down of debt but through a growth in EBITDA as we move back towards target the middle part of the target of the range we'll have a revolver there that's available for us to again take advantage and be strategic when the right asset or opportunity is available to us.
So I think as I mentioned we'd expect that if we borrowed the growth in EBITDA at about 5x there's $400 million of capacity during the year and investing the cash flows another $800 million so in a normal course that's $1.2 billion to invest but certainly wouldn't want to eliminate the possibility that we operate at the high end of that range for the right asset or the right opportunity.
Dave let me take your question around cell splitting and AT&amp;T's comments on their call this morning around creating more capacity within their network.
Cell splitting as you know is just that.
It's utilizing a new site and reducing the size of the cell that a prior site was covering.
And so certainly with the top 72% of our towers in the top 100 markets and significantly more than any of our peers cell splitting and capacity challenges occur where population density is the greatest.
And so we certainly expect to be working actively with our customer AT&amp;T on accommodating their needs to split cells and we expect to have significant numbers of sites in fact many of them already that would accommodate that type of activity around cell splitting.
And so we would expect to see some activity going forward in that regard.
Obviously it's just January so it's a little bit early to put that into any kind of guidance or outlook but you can bet we'll be very actively in those conversations and that fits right into the other conversation we were just having around about DAS systems and I believe that they actually mentioned DAS as a technology and architecture they're pursuing.
We already do business with AT&amp;T at the DAS level and would expect that again as I mentioned in my remarks DAS will play an increasingly meaningful role in helping AT&amp;T and all the carriers meet the capacity challenges in these dense urban environments or other places where a macro tower site won't provide the capacity that's required.
And just let me expand on that just a moment.
Because having been in this DAS business now for about 7 years there was a time when it was very challenging to profile the leasing opportunity for a DAS system because a lot of these areas had what we would all term as sort of minimal or substandard coverage voice coverage from a traditional tower site.
Well obviously that standard maybe 5 or 6 years ago of what you potentially needed to hold a voice call is just wholly inadequate today as we are all burdening these networks with broadband Internet expectations.
And that is really why now you've seen this small-cell site architecture really come into the forefront and be a technology that is widely accepted and adopted.
And it's really demand based.
It's the fact that the capacity challenges and the demand on the networks have really come to this architecture and made it now a very attractive solution.
Whereas before 5 or 7 years ago we didn't have these capacity challenges typically on a network and so notwithstanding the technology that was there as an opportunity the lease-up opportunity was more elongated or difficult to underwrite.
So anyway happy to answer that and appreciated obviously AT&amp;T's comments this morning on the capacity needs.
And our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Maybe first question just going back to -- the potential portfolios that might be out there whether it's T-Mo or some of the private equity portfolios that may come up for grabs.
The balance sheet where it is now understanding you've got revolver and the ability to lever incremental growth in EBITDA.
It does seem like one of these deals potentially might require you to introduce equity and issue shares.
I'm just wondering how you think through that.
Is that something you're willing to do at this point? And then second question we had talked on the third quarter call as it related to the 2012 outlook about Alltel and risk that they were going to de-commission or Verizon was going to de-commission a substantial number of cell sites and I'm just wondering as we start to get into 2012 how that's tracking relative to the plan you laid out? Sure Jason I'll take the first one.
I'll just say we'll be very disciplined.
We're pretty proud of our shares.
You've seen what we've done to take out 1/3 of the company over the last several years and we don't issue shares casually and so we'll be very disciplined in our review of any transaction that would require us to issue shares.
On your second question Jason around churn.
As I noted last quarter we expect the churn in 2012 if you counted number of tenants to be up about 10% over 2011.
That increase was attributable as we mentioned largely to Alltel.
It's almost -- it's 70% loaded in the front half of 2012 and 30% in the back half of the year and the split in that first half is almost even.
So higher churn in the first 2 quarters of this year and then in the back half we're currently expecting significantly less churn and as we sit here today we think it's on track for what we talked about last quarter.
And our next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Thank you very much for transparency AFFO calculated the same way as American Tower.
What a concept to have one number exactly the same way so we all can do evaluation works so thank you very much for that.
Second just to dig into some of the details on NextG Ben I think in your comments you mentioned that the $50 million annual run rate on the gross margin side the press release talked about $40 million and then another $10 million under construction.
When does that $10 million come in? Yes the vast majority of that will be over the first 12 months of ownership.
In fact potentially all of it in the first 12 months of ownership and that number obviously doesn't account for any additional business or leasing that you might expect.
So that's just purely contracted.
So we're having to swag the number a little bit here but that's about as close as we can peg it.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then you mentioned the $17 million G&amp;A no material synergies until 2013.
And then you mentioned that the adjusted or the EBITDA impact could be 5x to 6x the current level in 5 years was that referring to like the $40 million that you have currently less the $17 million? Just trying to gauge what you're trying to signal to us there.
Everybody's got to have a goal and we've got some pretty tall goals around here for this asset and so if you come off the $33 million sort of run rate to start with if you will in terms of contracted less the full boat of G&amp;A could we see a business that's 5 to 6x bigger than that in 5 years? That's our expectation and certainly our aspirational goal.
And I will further say that I've not ever seen an opportunity in this industry where an asset that is in our case 5% of the enterprise value of the company could potentially if you reverse engineer what I just said about growth could potentially be well outside its size relative to contribution to growth.
Many multiples of its relative size in terms of contribution to growth.
And so we -- it's again -- it's incredibly analogous.
The more time we spend on this the more similar it feels and the economics the more similar they feel to the original tower portfolios we acquired in 1999 where obviously the carrier built sites in the major cities have proven up over the last 12 years to be the most valuable and where revenue on those sites for example just as we're revisiting history here have more than tripled over the last 10 to 12 years.
So again we have high expectations and that's what that came from.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right.
And also in the original press release when you talked about the acquisition you mentioned that you thought it would be neutral to AFFO per share initially then obviously become quite accretive.
In the press release you also mentioned I think $60 million in incremental interest expense from the new facility.
Just trying to gauge what are you thinking as far as NextG itself as far as AFFO per share in 2012? Yes.
I think it will be -- Rick I think it will be about a push still.
The numbers have been mentioned in the first 12 months of about $33 million of adjusted EBITDA and that's about what the interest costs will be on that component.
The whole number that we gave you there includes the impact of refinancing the existing credit facilities the money that we're raising for WCP and a little extra funds that we'll have left over.
So I think we're trying to help you with a couple of different numbers including where interest expense will be for the full year '12 if we're right about guessing on closing dates for the various acquisitions and closing dates on the debt.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> So that $60 million included the assumption from Wireless Capital Partners? That's right and maybe just to be -- put a finer point on it we're still saying we think it's a push in the first 12 months for NextG relative to the cost of the money.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> That helps a lot.
And then another just a logical question when you mentioned Wireless Capital Partners you said that the cash before interest expense would be the $42 million.
Where's that going to get put? Is that going into revenue? Is that going into cost reductions? How should we think about where that will come through the financial statements?.
Well ultimately it will fall down to AFFO.
And where it exactly falls above adjusted EBITDA I think we're still working through exactly what that will look like and as I think after close we'll take you through it.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay and then final question T-Mobile you mentioned you're starting to see some activity there.
I assume that guidance for 2012 did not assume -- kind of caught a lot of people off guard them throwing in the towel that quickly any kind of renewed activity from T-Mobile? We did not include that.
A vast majority of the activity we have on our outlook is from AT&amp;T Verizon and Sprint.
We would've had some in there for T-Mobile.
And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie Capital.
I think you mentioned in the past that you have over $300 million in annual ground lease expense.
You already own considerably more land than your competitors.
I wonder how do you view ground lease or other land purchase opportunities versus buying tower or additional DAS assets.
And will the pace of land acquisitions increase over the next year given attractive credit markets? Sure Kevin I'll take that.
You are right we do have approximately $300 million a year of ground lease expense and I would divide that into basically 2 categories.
One of the activities which we've obviously spent enormous amount of time on in the 11 000 transactions that I've talked about thus far in securing the portfolio.
In 2007 we were less than 20% owned in terms of sites and a much lower percentage of gross margin that was on site that we had greater than 30 years.
So we both have focused virtually all of our activity on ground leases that have less than 20 years remaining on them.
And that activity would have in it a component of a mark-to-market rate on those ground leases whether we were purchasing them or extending the ground lease.
And the purchases have largely offset any rental increase that we've seen from the ground leases as we've renewed them.
I think the majority of that or a lot of that is through the system now and so most of the activity from this point forward and as we think about the future the majority of the activity that we'll be doing will be purely a financial test around do we want the liability off balance sheet in the form of a ground lease because we're able to finance it at a lower cost with the landlord or do we prefer it on the balance sheet because we're able to achieve a lower cost of capital using our balance sheet to acquire the property? And I think more and more as we go forward we'll be thinking about our land purchases in that context and utilizing the lowest cost of capital to acquire them because we'll have already secured the land leases for such a long period of time.
In terms of pace I think you can expect for the next 4 to 5 years we're probably going to continue at the pace that we're on.
It has great operational benefits beyond the financial benefits to have long-term leases and improve the lease structure and own land.
And so it's worth facilitating customers getting on sites and customers are making decisions about where to allocate their capital to make the quickest improvement in their network.
We know that land ownership and long-term leases help that and so I think there are some operational benefit to it.
I think we'd probably stay on this pace for the next 4 to 5 years and then after that it probably comes down and we're just purely making a financial decision.
Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.
Research Division</strong> Just 2 if I could.
First of all did I understand you to say that the WCP acquisition would be accretive to the growth rate or accretive to growth? And in general can you talk about the relative appeal of land assets under other tower company towers versus under carrier towers? And just secondly again philosophically wondering if you could comment on the sort of debate between what are more appealing acquisition candidate assets towers that were originally built for carrier use or those who were purpose-built for Co-lo? On the first one James we believe it will be both accretive to ultimately AFFO per share which is how we evaluate everything.
I think over time you will also find that it will be accretive to our growth rate as we go through the process of applying the expertise that we have that we complied to our own portfolio around extensions and purchasing the land.
On a relative appeal standpoint you've got to look at the underlying assets and the underlying towers and what the tenancy of those towers are and I would say in terms of looking at that that's one of the considerations that we make as we think about owning land of any third party towers is who are the tenants installed on that tower's -- on the tower as well as the location of the asset.
It's not too dissimilar from the analysis that we've done under tower portfolios for a long period of time.
I would just add on the other activity around purchasing land under other people's towers.
Obviously we've done that now in the WCP transaction as it will close.
We've also seen public announcements where the Unison the 2 large portfolios that were acquired over time by Unison have now traded to other tower companies.
We are certainly comfortable owning land under other people's towers.
We're sort of in the landlord business.
That's what we do for a living and there's not much difference between whether you own the steel on the tower.
Obviously there's a revenue opportunity as we've certainly described our core business in terms of growth but at the right price it's a financial transaction and to ultimately own and underwrite the value of that site through ownership of the ground and we certainly would expect to do that over time.
Obviously this one transaction puts us in that business.
Others have made that decision already as I mentioned and we would expect to continue that as one of the many opportunities we have to allocate capital but it will be purely on a discretionary sort of pure financial decision to see what's the highest and best use of that capital.
And I guess James your third question was on purpose-built towers? Research Division</strong> Yes.
Would we prefer to own towers built by the carriers originally.
And I think James this comes down to as we've seen over time what ultimately determines the value of tower assets is the location and the need.
And so whether a carrier originally built it or it's built by a company whose out building spec towers ultimately the value of those towers is determined by the location and the need.
We've done incredibly well with towers that were originally built by Bell Atlantic Mobile and BellSouth and other carriers.
We've also done very well with towers that we built a long time ago.
So I think I wouldn't necessary draw a distinction in terms of preferring one over another.
It just comes down to evaluating price the location and then what we believe the demand would be.
And as Ben mentioned earlier at that point once you've evaluated those things and we're pretty disciplined on the price because we know we have an alternative we can buy the towers that we already own in the form of share purchases or pursue a third-party tower opportunity.
And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> I'm interested in just the -- you commented on the 4 national carriers.
Any commentary on other carriers such as Clearwire in terms of the pace of leasing or I guess in Clearwire's case amendments.
And then with respect to the NextG growth targets over the next many years was that an organic growth through just lease-up or was that through assets expansion? On the first question Jon our outlook for 2012 does not include hardly any benefits from folks like Clearwire or others that may have spectrum but not -- have not been deploying.
And so as we get into calendar year 2012 we'll just have to see how some of those other carriers come.
As I mentioned virtually all of the growth that we've put in the outlook comes from Verizon AT&amp;T and Sprint.
We're certainly encouraged by what we see with Clearwire and as they do their 4G LTE overlay and then also prospectively go back and do some infill in markets we have expectations hopefully that we'll see some activity from them later in the year.
And then Jon on NextG in terms of growth in the aspirational targets I threw out obviously that's a sort of a business case.
So that assumes co-location on existing networks as well as growth with building additional networks that we would capture in the marketplace.
So then there's a capital component that we're not going to get into on this call it's too early to do that but suffice it to say that the capital deployed in this business not unlike the early days of the towers business if you get it right and we think we will based on our current experience already is that these come at very high returns far in excess of any kind of hurdle rates that you want to impose on it.
And so hence the reason we did the transaction.
We think it's accretive to not only growth but accretive to value.
LLC Research Division</strong> And as you make further investments in that business segment is that going to be weighted more towards indoor or outdoor? I think you'll see us do both.
The indoor is very attractive but each individual one is pretty small.
So you've got to do a lot of them obviously to make a meaningful difference and we are doing a lot of them and we'll continue to.
I mean virtually every sports arena or public venue and ultimately class A office buildings we think are ultimately going to have a shared wireless infrastructure component to them and we got a long way to go in America at getting that done.
And there's room from other players beyond ourselves obviously.
And so as that market continues to develop we will continue have a very active indoor presence but we will also pursue outdoor of zip codes as we call them neighborhoods and urban centers and things that we've described.
I think it's really a -- it's both.
You'll have outdoor and indoor both attempting to meet the same capacity challenge that's uniform out there.
LLC Research Division</strong> And then finally internationally if you could maybe give us an update on next generation broadband in Australia and how you feel about entering new international markets that some of your peers have been doing? Yes we are really pleased with Australia.
It's too early to really see it much in the financial results but there's a lot going on right now down there.
Not only the national broadband network that is sponsored by the government in terms of bringing broadband fiber and wireless connectivity to essentially 100% of the population.
So there's going to be leasing and build opportunities for us there.
But there's also for the very same reasons we see it here renewed commitment on the part of the carriers to add capacity and improve networks in Australia.
And I was just down there a couple of months ago and we have very high expectations.
I won't put out a similar aspirational goal there that's in terms of guidance or anything but you should expect considerable more growth over the next 3 years than you've seen in the last 3 years in Australia and potentially some investment opportunities down there as well.
And it wouldn't surprise me at all to see us launch a DAS business in Australia.
I think that's something that's going to make a lot of sense to us down the road.
We will continue to evaluate other international markets.
We've looked at a couple things and some friends in Western Europe recently.
Don't really like what we see there in terms of the industry dynamics so much.
We continue to believe the U.S.
and the Australian market which is almost identical to the U.S.
in terms of market character is the fastest-growing most profitable market for the carriers and where the consumer demand for data demand data is driving the capacity needs that's driving frankly these businesses our business in the U.S.
And so we think at the price that we see in the market today this is the most attractive investment for us but others can have different views.
We're going to continue to work on what we've got on our plate and we're pretty excited about it.
And our next question comes from the line of Clay Moran with Benchmark Company.
LLC Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
One thing I didn't follow was how the land purchase enhances the AFFO growth rate.
So if you could Jay maybe explain that again.
And then over on NextG could you just tell us what the current customer mix is? Maybe break it down by the national versus other and then what the 2011 revenue growth rate was.
Sure Clay on your first question.
As we have experienced in our own portfolio as ground leases approach their term end date and you go to renegotiate those leases you pay whatever is market as you enter into a new lease on the property.
And so we evaluated the leases and our view is that there is an increase coming in the rental rates that are going to be paid underneath those ground leases.
Thus an increase in the growth rate.
On NextG Clay I'm not going get into specifically breaking out each individual revenue component of NextG.
The early days of some of the networks were built in urban centers for some of the later rollouts Metro PCS Leap Wireless.
The company today NextG does business with all of the major carriers in a significant way and we would expect that to grow materially over time with the lease-up opportunities that are resident for each of AT&amp;T Verizon and Sprint as well as new build opportunities for all of the major carriers including T-Mobile.
So I think you'll see us a significant mix change.
Today it is not the majority of the revenue it's not to the big 4 but over time I think you'll see it change and probably flip such that the majority of the revenue going forward in my 5-year aspirational goal I think it will look a lot more like the traditional tower portfolio that we have as the capacity needs are most acute in these large 4 carriers.
And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Research Division</strong> Just 2 questions.
First on the DAS business driving a little deeper here.
I just want to understand maybe some of the non-cash elements relative to the traditional towers business.
Also I was under the impression that carriers contribute to the CapEx of the DAS system build-outs and wondering if that's accurate in terms of NextG's business.
Separately on the recent refresh on your credit facility I was wondering if there were any net debt to leverage tests.
I had read somewhere there was a 6x net debt to leverage test that dropped down to 5.5x in 2014.
I didn't know if that was preliminary or just incorrect? Jonathan I think on your first question just to be really clear we threw around a couple of numbers to span what's going into the NextG numbers.
As we talk about what we think site rental gross margin of $50 million and then obviously the G&amp;A that's all cash received.
And so the timing on that I don't  if there's anything more to say about that but it would continue in perpetuity.
In terms of how the carriers pay for this and how we structure these as Ben mentioned similar to the tower portfolio when a tenant comes to the site oftentimes they do make a contribution to the CapEx or subsidize the cost of expanding the network to hold them and over time as this plays out and gets larger scale we'll see how that goes.
That's probably the 2 I will say there around pricing.
Each system is different but it's generally pretty similar to what you've seen historically in the tower business.
I think specifically on the terms of the credit facility we'll wait until that closes before I go into great detail about that.
But it doesn't have an impact on changing our targeted leverage level of 4x to 6x as I talked about before and we would not expect to do anything that would limit our flexibility to be anything other than what we've had over the last 5 to 7 years as we structure the capital structure.
And our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.
Research Division</strong> I just had a follow-up question on your outlook.
I believe when you first provided 2012 you suggested that the activity you are seeing from Sprint at that time was included in the outlook and I think in 4Q Sprint increased some activity and it's ongoing now.
So is there a scenario where you could increase the outlook based on just coming from Sprint or is all of the MLA already accounted for? Also just one question on the straight-line impact that you guided for first Q.
I think that goes up or is it a trend of deceleration? What will be a driver of that? Yes on the first question if Sprint were to go out and lease more sites or do greater amounts of activity then we could see potentially a change.
One thing I would point out is that we saw the actual pickup in Sprint activity dating all the way back to the second quarter of 2011.
So I think we saw it earlier than others did and the comments that are making -- that have been made more publicly recently are really commensurate with what -- a level of activity that we've seen 4 6-plus months from Sprint.
And so I don't -- as we've looked at our outlook and reaffirmed it for 2012 I don't think we've seen any of that.
But to the extent that they were to change their plans or processes or deploy more sites then we could potentially see the benefit of that in our outlook.
When you're looking at the differences between the contribution of cash receipts and reported revenues there's going to be some movement quarter to quarter just as leases renew a normal course.
There's not anything significant that's happening in the first quarter relative to the past quarters.
I think broadly as you look at our revenue growth our outlook for 2012 it's got revenue growth of approximately $85 million on a reported basis.
And on a cash basis that's going to be about $111 million.
So growth on a cash basis is about 7% roughly but I think the ins and outs quarter-to-quarter they're going to move just a little bit but I think I'd step back and look at it over the course of the year and tell you I think that the amount of contributions from non-cash revenues is actually going to decline year-over-year to the tune of about $25 million as we near that crossover point in 2015 as I talked about in my comments.
And our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just one more question here around the DAS business.
You talked about the work you've done with your land leases in order to secure long-term ownership or control under towers.
You can't really own whatever would be considered land's rights of way in the DAS business so what type of statistics can you provide with regards to what NextG has in terms of long-term access or exclusivities around the rights of way? Brett that's a great question.
And it's one of the differences and I think a favorable difference actually DAS versus the tower work that we've done on the ground.
To operate a DAS network in most jurisdictions you're organized and have competitive local exchange carrier status which gives you rights certain contractual rights to access public rights of way and utility poles and easements.
And so there's a established practice for what the pole attachment payments or think of it as ground rent are in those in markets and it's got to be consistently applied among really all users.
For example a cable company in a market.
And so it's a very sort of well trodden legal standard there of what gives us the access to those sites over a long period of time at very predictable expenses or payments.
And so I don't think you have a circumstance here in the DAS business where you can be potentially have the economics eroded over time because of what's happening on the ground which obviously is a concern in the tower business and why we've spent the last 5 years working on the ground portfolio as we have.
I really don't think you have that here.
And in fact a much more orderly and disciplined process of accessing the public right of way as a competitive local exchange carrier and we think that's pretty well established and a benefit of the business.
Research Division</strong> Are these agreements or these access to right of way are they indefinite? Because a land lease it might be 50 years but still there's a termination on it? No these are definitely long term.
Maybe operator we've gone past the hour but maybe we'll take two more questions and then end.
Our final question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
Research Division</strong> I have 2 basic questions.
Your margins were up a lot the last couple of years but just looking at the FFO versus AMT you're still a bit below those guys.
Do you think there's much room for expansion over the longer term here and kind of what drives that.
And then secondly just listened to AT&amp;T's conference call and their issues with spectrum and trying to move the networks over.
Maybe at a high-level what percentage of T and Verizon what percentage of the spectrum do they own? Do you actually think they'd build out at this point? And they did mention shutting down a 3G network to free up capacity spectrum capacity how do you think that would play out and affect you? On your first question around margin we would expect those to continue to go up in the absence of acquisition activity.
As we've seen over time we're  able to increase the margins that the gross -- site rental gross margin line just considering the growth in revenue against growth in expenses.
Those have been rising at about 150 to 200 basis points per annum.
As we go down to the AFFO level we certainly don't expect that we'll lose any of that with regards to G&amp;A or other expenses.
And so I would expect you will continue to see those margins expand considerably over time.
The one exception to that is obviously if we buy an asset that has lower margins than the existing base it will dilute some of that growth.
But NextG being a good example of that that would be "dilutive" short-term to the margins.
But over time we think it's actually margin and growth enhancing.
So I think it will come down to the mix and what do we -- how do we allocate capital and what percentage of that ultimately gets allocated towards assets.
But in a normal course if you just think about organic leasing I would expect those margins to continue to expand enough to enjoy the high incremental margins we've seen over the last several years.
With spectrum I think the best way to handle your spectrum question is we're not in the habit of really commenting on specifically spectrum as it relates to individual customers.
But I think broadly as you think about our business it's important to remember that there are spectrum challenges and constraints really in all of the carriers whether it's a capital constraint on build-out or utilization constraint.
And so it's -- they are constantly looking for a cost effective way to utilize the spectrum or reuse the spectrum through cell splitting to get more value out of that spectrum asset.
And so I think you're going to continue to see more and more reuse of spectrum as we all continue to put more demands on the network and you'll probably see some -- obviously the DAS component of that become meaningful overtime and other offloading strategies like Wi-Fi even in stationary locations.
So I would not get into individually on with respect to each customer's situation but obviously the capacity challenges that we're all placing on these networks is making it a significant burden on the carriers today.
I think we've got time for one more and I'll say up front I appreciate everybody hanging with us on the call for 1 hour and 20 minutes this morning.
Thank you.
And our final question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
Research Division</strong> Just 2 real quick.
So first as we're thinking about internal growth for the company.
It looks like 2011 I think you talked a little bit about the reasons why before is a better year -- sorry 2012 would be a better year than 2011? And how would you rate when you look at the numbers what's going to come from upgrades versus actually new tower co-locations? Upgrades meaning amendments.
And just a follow-up question on the AFFO definition and again thanks for all that detail.
Why wouldn't you subtract out preferred dividends just from the calculations since that's a cost of financing that's used in your company more like debt than an equity dividend? Sure Mike.
On your first question we do expect slightly better internal growth certainly on a cash basis in 2012.
And I think most of that is related to the timing of the Sprint Network Vision.
We've got about 6 months of that during 2011 and our outlook implies that we're going to have a full 12 months of that activity in 2012.
So I think Sprint would be the main change if you're comparing those 2 years.
And with regards to amendment activity versus new lease activity if you're calculating it on a revenue basis amendments continue to make up in the neighborhood of 70% of the total activity on a dollar basis.
Obviously if it was account basis it would be greater than that but on a dollar basis it's making up about 70% of the growth there.
On your second question around preferred dividends I guess I would say it's a bit of a moot point at this point because we've just converted our 6.25% preferred.
So that's now gone.
But honestly the spirit of what we were doing was to simply take exactly what American Tower was doing and report our company on the exact same basis for comparability purposes.
I think in the future if we were to ever to do a security and had a similar cash dividend then we could look at should the industry adjust the metric? And I'd be open to doing that but the logic simply was it was going away anyway and so I thought from a comparability standpoint the best thing to do was just literally do exactly what our other peer was doing.
And hopefully that becomes the industry metric.
Mike just to come back to your first question just to add my 2 cents.
I think it's January still.
So it's very early for us to be looking out for the year and see.
But I think you can see beginnings of evidence that you could have more cell splitting in 2012 than you had in 2011.
I don't know that that makes a material difference in our performance in any given year.
Obviously an activity as you well know that starts in a year and carries forward at best you're only going to get a half year convention in that in your financial results.
And so we'll have to see but ending run rate is always very important.
And so we're very pleased with what we see for 2012.
I want to thank everybody for bearing with us on this long-winded call today.
We just felt like spending $1.5 billion since we last spoke to you deserved a little more explanation than 60 minutes would contain.
So I appreciate you bearing with us.
We're very excited for how we've positioned the company going forward.
We've got a lot of work to do and we look forward to speaking with you on the next call.
Thanks again.

Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
As you've seen from our press release and as outlined on Slide 3 we had an excellent first quarter exceeding the high end of our previously issued guidance for site rental revenue site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA.
We completed the acquisition of assets from Wireless Capital Partners which we refer to as WCP on January 31 and the acquisition of NextG Networks on April 10.
And we are making good progress integrating these acquisitions.
We believe these acquisitions and the other investments we made during the quarter will enhance long-term AFFO per share.
The strong year-to-date results from our site rental business together with continued strong results from network services and the completion of the acquisition of NextG and the WCP assets allow us to increase our 2012 outlook for site rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA by approximately $108 million and $88 million respectively.
Further we saw a 25% increase in leasing activity in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year with the 4 major carriers in the U.S.
accounting for approximately 83% of the activity.
Turning to Slide 4.
I'd like to highlight a few things from our first quarter results.
During the first quarter we generated site rental revenue of $498 million up 9% or $41 million from the first quarter of 2011.
Approximately 6% of the growth came from new tenant additions reflecting the increased leasing activity driven by the 4 major U.S.
carriers upgrading their networks.
The acquisition of the WCP assets contributed approximately 1% to the growth in site rental revenue.
Growth from the existing base of business from contracted renewals and contracted escalators net of any churn contributed another approximately 1% to the growth in revenue.
Further we had approximately $5 million of nonrecurring items in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $9 million in the first quarter of 2011.
Site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues less cost of operation was $375 million up 11% from the first quarter of 2011 reflecting an incremental margin of 89%.
Furthermore our Services business performed very well posting another record quarter with the contribution from services gross margin increasing year-over-year by 45%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2012 was $360 million up 13% from the first quarter of 2011.
As shown on Slide 5 AFFO was $198 million up 13% from the first quarter of 2011 or $0.69 per share also up 13% from the first quarter of 2011.
As reflected on Slide 6 we significantly exceeded our previously issued outlook for the first quarter for site rental revenue site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA due to outperformance in our core business and the benefit of the acquisition of WCP which was not included in our outlook for the first quarter.
We exceeded our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outlook by $22 million due to an increase in leasing activity in the base business of approximately $7 million a $6 million contribution from the WCP assets which was not in our original guidance issued on January 25 2012.
Approximately $5 million of nonrecurring items and the higher services margin contribution of approximately $4 million beyond that which we had included in our previously issued guidance.
With respect to AFFO the outperformance and adjusted EBITDA was offset by the additional interest expense we incurred on the debt we raised to pay for both of the acquisitions we closed this year.
Turning to investments and liquidity.
During the first quarter as shown on Slide 7 we spent $182 million on acquisition $180 million of which was to acquire the assets of WCP.
The WCP portfolio includes approximately 2 300 ground lease related assets including over 150 related to Crown Castle towers with 80% of the cash flow from the assets generated from the big 4 wireless carriers.
We also assumed approximately $320 million of debt associated with the WCP assets.
Additionally during the first quarter we purchased approximately 700 000 of our common shares for $36 million.
Since 2003 we have spent $2.7 billion to purchase approximately 101 million of our common shares and potential shares equal to 1/3 of the company's share at an average price of $27 per share.
With regards to our capital expenditures during the first quarter we've spent $65 million.
These capital expenditures included $28 million in our land lease purchase program.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 77% of our growth margin.
We continue to enjoy significant success with this program as evidenced by the fact that today 39% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own up from less than 15% in January of 2007.
Furthermore the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years.
We believe this activity has resulted in the most secure land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease exploration.
And we continue to believe this is an important long-term effort that provides a long-term benefit as it protects our margins and controls our largest operating expense.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we've spent $4 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $33 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures.
The latter consisting of $26 million on existing sites and $7 million on the construction of new sites including distributed antenna system deployment.
Further during the first quarter and in April 2012 we used $56 million of our cash to purchase $24 million of our 9% senior notes and $28 million of our 7 3/4 senior secured notes.
After the quarter end on April 10 2012 we closed the NextG acquisition for $1 billion.
We ended the first quarter of 2012 with total debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 5.9x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of approximately 3.2x.
Turning to our second quarter and full year 2012 outlook as shown on Slide 8 and 9 we expect site rental revenue of between $509 million and $514 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $360 million and $365 million for the second quarter of 2012.
The sequential growth in site rental revenue from the first quarter 2012 to the second quarter 2012 includes the benefit of approximately $21 million of additional site rental revenue from NextG and the WCP assets.
As we noted last year we expected our growth in site rental revenue during the second quarter to be offset by churn during the period and this continues to be our expectation.
Further we expect minimal benefits from nonrecurring items in the second quarter.
The cumulative impact of these items is in expected net sequential growth in site rental revenue of approximately $15 million from Q1 2012 to Q2 2012.
The sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from Q1 2012 to Q2 2012 is muted by the aforementioned nonrecurring items in the first quarter and our expectation of approximately $4 million less of service margin than the first quarter and the normal expected increase in seasonal repairs and maintenance of approximately $2 million.
As shown on Slide 9 our increased 2012 outlook suggests that annual site rental revenue growth of approximately 10% adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% and AFFO growth of 13%.
The $190 million of expected growth in site rental revenue from 2011 to 2012 is comprised of the following: approximately $100 million of the growth attributable to additional tenant equipment added to our sites reflecting the strong leasing activity we have enjoyed since the beginning of the year; and approximately $90 million of site rental revenue from our acquisitions of NextG and the WCP assets.
The $154 million of growth in adjusted EBITDA from 2011 to 2012 is comprised of approximately $50 million to $55 million of benefit from our acquisitions of NextG and the WCP assets and $100 million of growth in our base business which is up from $57 million of the expected growth in our base business and the previous outlook that we'd provided.
I'm delighted with the outperformance of our base business and our increased expectations for the balance of 2012.
We expect AFFO growth of approximately 13% from 2012.
This reflects our increased expectations for adjusted EBITDA offset by the higher interest expense cost associated with the debt we incurred as a result of the acquisitions.
We would expect to augment this AFFO growth through opportunistic investment of cash flow and activities such as share purchases tower acquisitions new site construction and land purchases.
Consistent with our past practice our outlook does not include the benefit from these expected investments.
Even with our recent acquisitions of NextG and WCP assets we expect to have significant cash to invest in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share growth.
For the full year 2012 we expect to generate approximately $830 million of AFFO and invest approximately $325 million on capital expenditures related to purchases of land beneath our towers the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites particularly distributed antenna system.
Ignoring our borrowing capacity the portion of our AFFO after expected capital expenditures represent a little over $125 million per quarter of cash flow we could invest in activities related to our core business including purchases of our shares and acquisitions.
Consistent with our past practice we are focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.
I believe this level of capital investment can add between 4% and 6% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate annually.
In summary we had an excellent first quarter as we continue to execute around our core business and I'm excited about our prospects for growth and investments as I look forward to the remainder of 2012.
And with that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
We realized it's a very busy week in the market.
As Jay just mentioned we had an excellent first quarter exceeding outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA.
And we're excited about our business as we look to the balance of 2012.
For the first time since the late '90s all of the major wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously and we are enjoying unprecedented visibility in the future revenue growth as reflected in our increased guidance.
These positive trends are reflected throughout our entire business including organic site leasing activity our distributed antenna system business our network services activities and our Australian business.
Leasing activity grew 25% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year.
The big 4 U.S.
carriers accounted for approximately 83% of the growth in the first quarter and as you expect amendments made up approximately 80% of their activity in the first quarter as they continue to focus on upgrading their networks.
Further I'm very encouraged by the application activity we are seeing in the business which we expect would translate into revenue later in the year.
Consistent with their public statements we are seeing continued activity by Verizon and AT&amp;T in upgrading their networks to LTE Sprint's Network Vision related activity and the resumption of activity by T-Mobile.
Additionally we look forward to assisting T-Mobile in their announced plan to upgrade approximately 37 000 cell sites to LTE over the next 2 years.
In addition to a strong quarter of site leasing our U.S.
network services business performed exceptionally well as you might expect.
Service revenues were up 27% and service margins were up 46% compared to the same quarter last year.
This success results from a diligent effort to capture more of the opportunities to assist customers in locating or upgrading installations on our sites.
Further we enjoyed meaningful growth in our Australian business as the carriers are actively upgrading their networks to accommodate capacity challenges brought on by expanded data services just as we have seen in the U.S.
Finally in the first quarter we closed on the acquisition of the ground lease assets from WCP and earlier this month we closed on the NextG Networks acquisition which positions us as the industry leader in distributed antenna systems or sometimes referred to as the small-cell site solution business and builds on the DAS success we have already enjoyed.
As part of this acquisition we're excited to have the NextG team joining Crown Castle and believe we will benefit from their expertise going forward.
The integration of both these acquisitions is on track and proceeding very well.
I know it is early days with NextG we are even more excited about the future prospects of our combined organizations as the market leader in this exciting new extension of our business.
In fact small-cell architecture received a lot of attention at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona earlier this year.
Globally there were over 50 operators that have committed to deploying small cells in the first quarter of this year.
In the United States operators are augmenting their traditional infrastructure with small-cell solutions to boost network capacity and operators are starting to see all these technologies as key parts heterogenous networks.
Importantly for us the benefit of the shared wireless infrastructure model we enjoy in towers is present in small-cell deployments and we are excited about this new extension of our business.
The combination of all these positive trends allows us to increase our 2012 outlook which now suggests AFFO growth of approximately 13% for the year compared to last year.
And as is our practice we'd expect to further enhance this growth by disciplined discretionary investment of our cash flow in tower and DAS acquisitions share purchases and land acquisitions and had aspirations that these investments combined with our organic growth can achieve AFFO per share growth rates in the mid to high teens as we've delivered in the past.
Finally before I turn the call over for questions I would like to discuss some of the key trends we are seeing in mobile Internet demand.
Cited in recent reports by Cisco which validate the growth we're seeing from carriers as they continue to invest in their networks to meet the onslaught of demand the mobile Internet.
According to Cisco's latest forecast global mobile data traffic grew a 2.3-fold in 2011 more than doubling for the fourth year in a row.
And the expectation is that mobile data traffic will double again in 2012 an amazing accomplishment off of an ever increasing base.
The proliferation of high-end handsets tablets and laptops on mobile networks is a generator of traffic because these devices offer the consumer content and applications not supported by previous generations of mobile devices.
The evolving device mix and growth in usage of devices continued to drive growth in global mobile data traffic.
In 2011 while smartphones still only represented 12% of global handsets in use they accounted for 82% of total handset traffic.
Further the growth in usage per device is expected to outpace the growth in the number of devices by a wide margin driven largely by increased connection speed and network capacity improvements.
As the carriers prepare for LTE it's interesting to note that while 4G connections represent less than 1% of mobile connections today they already account for 6% of mobile data traffic.
The impact of 4G connections on traffic is significant because 4G connections generate a disproportion amount of traffic.
And in 2011 4G connection already generated 28x more traffic than an average non-4G connection giving you some sense of the challenges that carriers are facing as we migrate from 3G to 4G services.
Cisco forecasts that by 2016 4G will represent 6% of the connections but 36% of total traffic.
And a 4G connection should generate over 9x more traffic than a non-4G connection.
Importantly for our business the success of the global transition to the wireless Internet is concentrated in developed markets with the U.S.
leading the way having the largest 3G subscriber base in the world.
To that end as it pertains to the U.S.
the statistics are even more compelling.
In 2011 mobile data traffic grew 2.7-fold in the U.S.
and Cisco estimates that mobile data traffic will grow 16-fold from 2011 to 2016 that's a compound annual growth rate of 74%.
Adoption rates for smartphones continue to accelerate generating 14x more data traffic per month than a basic handset driving wireless data traffic and increased tower demand from carriers striving to maintain a suitable level of network quality and reliability.
The number of smartphones in the U.S.
grew by 59% in 2011 reaching 128 million and is expected to double again by 2016.
Further smartphones accounted for 24% of the mobile traffic in the U.S.
at the end of 2011 are expected to account for over 60% by 2016.
These impressive growth statistics and the attendant required network investment are why we are excited about the U.S.
market.
It is the largest and fastest-growing wireless market in the world.
In order to keep pace with this anticipated growth we see wireless carriers continuing to invest in networks by adding capacity to existing sites splitting cell sites and utilizing small cell such as DAS where traditional macro site is not feasible.
To that end I believe our tower portfolio and our ability to execute for customers best positions us to capture this anticipated activity in the form of site leasing revenue growth as carriers continue to upgrade and add sites to meet this increasing consumer demand for wireless Internet.
Having the right assets in the right locations is critical to meeting the demands of carriers today as they are working to add network capacity.
We have the best located towers in the industry with 71% of our towers in the top 100 BTA and we are now the largest provider of small-cell solutions.
And as indicated by our quarterly surveys of customers we continue to deliver the highest level of customer service in the industry something we are very proud of.
This is further enhanced evidenced by our success in growing the network services portion of our business.
To wrap it up today I'm excited on many fronts.
Data growth in the U.S.
market and the prospects for profitable investment by carriers and network enhancements to support this growth.
Our position and focus on monetizing this opportunity through leadership in the U.S.
market and the opportunities I see to invest in our core business to augment the strong organic growth we are seeing is very exciting.
As we've said in the past our focus is on maximizing long-term AFFO per share through opportunistic investments which is going to include acquisitions share purchases and land purchases as we've done in the past.
Finally I want to say thank you to our employees for their hard work.
As the volume of new business and network services opportunities and company are reaching unprecedented levels and on top of that we're in the midst of integrating these 2 new businesses we recently acquired.
It's an exciting and busy time here at Crown Castle and I'd also like to welcome our new employees from NextG listening to this call.
With that operator I would be happy to turn the call over for questions.
.
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just maybe a question on the second quarter guide first of all.
You talked about it being up $15 million.
I think the deals contribute $21 million and then you're hurt by nonrecurrence of the $5 million onetimer.
So I guess on a net basis you're assuming the potential for a slight decline in site rental revenues.
I know you've talked before about churn and sort of pegged it to Alltel.
Can you just give us a sense as to what you're expecting that churn to be and maybe what the base business is actually doing? So is that still moving up and Alltel churn is just a decent amount so we get to the net number that's relatively flat or slightly down.
And then second question I guess is just on taxes between NextG NOLs and then you talked I think in the release about some valuation reversals in 2Q that impact taxes.
Does any of this move the needle on the NOL balance sort of in total and hence influence the retiming in your mind? Great.
On your first question we had originally when we put out the outlook for the first quarter and the second quarter of 2012 that back in January of this year we had assumed both in the first quarter and in the second quarter that the churn that was scheduled a portion of which was related to Alltel would offset the normal escalations that we were seeing in the business.
And for the first quarter we did a little better than that a little better than expected.
In the second quarter we stuck with the original assumption and we'll just kind have to see how it plays out.
So we made a lot of comments here about the leasing activity on -- if you could just look at the stray number think about it as newly originated site rental revenue in the period that amount of activity where we're seeing new tenancy they go on the towers that were not previously on those towers or tenants adding additional equipment to the sites they're already on.
That activity in total is up about 25% from the first quarter of last year and it's early days of the second quarter but we're in and around that range.
So I think the trajectory of the guidance as you look at the balance of the year we're certainly picking up in the third and fourth quarter as we move past kind of the first and second quarter amount of churn that we had.
We'll kind of see how it plays out in the balance of the quarter.
Does that answer your question? Research Division</strong> Jay is there any way you can quantify the Alltel churn? You actually did see it in 1Q.
I know you said it was later than expected but any dollar amount you pin to it? We don't like to get specific about individual customers.
So it wasn't Alltel.
We called it out the last time we gave outlook just to give you some flavor of what was happening but I'd rather not go all the way to that level of detail.
The second question you asked around taxes none of the acquisitions either WCP or NextG have any significant impact to our timing of NOLs so we continue to believe that we'll exhaust the current NOLs in late 2015 beginning of 2015.
And as we've talked about in past quarters and on past calls we're sort of planning if you will to think about reconversion no later than the beginning of 2016 which would enable us to avoid corporate taxes to a large extent.
So no change there on any of the adjustments that we've made related to these acquisitions or our forecast related to those acquisitions.
And the next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.
Research Division</strong> Conceptually are you seeing any change in call it the ratio of usage per square meter and data from say dense urban versus rural? In other words clearly to a degree the rising data tide list -- lists all boats.
But are you seeing the mix shift where it's listing let's say DAS on a relative basis more than say traditional macro towers or the other way around? I think James just in general we're seeing continued capacity constraints being evidenced in these networks and increasingly those are happening in areas where it's difficult to solve the problem with macro tower sites or rooftop sites hence the need for some of the small-cell sites that we've talked about and our strategic direction with the acquisition of NextG.
I think you're going to expect that to continue going forward as all of us as are consuming a lot more bandwidth and the spectrum is a relative finite resource and so the size of these ultimate cell sites continue to shrink.
I think it's important to note as we're now in both businesses in a big way we continue to see the small-cell site opportunity as very robust but complementary to the macro site business.
Clearly a macro site where that's a viable alternative is the preferred approach and that's a business that we're -- in our tower business we're obviously still focused on in a huge way.
So the way we think about the small cells and the DAS opportunity is to literally augment with a very same business model.
I think this is really important.
The very same business model in terms of a shared common element instead of it being the tower being the fiber typically here where we can share it among a number of providers in the market and make it very efficient for them to access our systems.
So that's really what we see and I think time will play out.
It's still very early days in this evolution of these sites and how the networks develop but we see a long runway.
Research Division</strong> And can you just -- also just help us think through what the impact of Verizon selling 700 megahertz spectrum say B-block spectrum to an AT&amp;T would be in terms of the relative impact on you of say Verizon deploying that spectrum versus AT&amp;T or another carrier? I think that's putting a pretty fine point on kind of what our expectations would be.
I think typically we see carriers working very hard to accommodate the demand that we're all placing as consumers on the networks and how carriers ultimately elect to allocate spectrum and acquire spectrum is something we don't spend a lot of time on with them.
I think it is interesting though to just consider the fact that the spectrum they're acquiring is of higher band than what they're selling which certainly suggests given the penetration and the propagation characteristics of the spectrum that small cells or smaller cells are certainly going to play a role going forward where you don't necessarily need the propagation characteristics of the 700 megahertz spectrum because the cell site size that you're trying to accommodate here will certainly be accommodated with a higher frequency.
So we thought that was sort of interesting in the observation.
But beyond that I really wouldn't have a comment for you.
And the next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Sprint has been talking about how they're moving along with the Nextel turndown a little faster than they had anticipated.
Could you just remind us how you restructured your relationship with them so we understand the extent to which it matters? Or does it matter? How quickly they go ahead with that? And then secondly T-Mobile keeps talking about maybe selling their towers.
Presumably all the major operators would look at it if it was on the market.
You've always viewed the -- what do you need to believe approach to doing these deals? A lot of people think that T-Mobile might end up putting its -- itself up for sale at this point after they do this.
What do you need to believe in order to buy a portfolio of towers from a carrier that might be a takeout target themselves? Okay great.
Brett on the first question with regards to Sprint and their turndown of the iDEN network which they'd indicated they can do.
Again the bookend of the exposure we have their we think that's about 2% to 3% of consolidated revenues if they were to turn down all of those sites.
We entered into an agreement with Sprint which we publically talked about at the end of last year and that agreement provided them the ability to take down those sites under the timeline that they had originally announced which would basically turn down the network in about 2014 which is commensurate with the average term they have remaining on those iDEN leases.
So I would say if you're trying to factor it in and you want to take all of that out take the wide end of it out assuming that 2013 2014 timeframe that we see a turndown of about 3% of consolidated revenues associated with iDEN.
And right now that's the best view that I have for you.
And then we'll just kind of go from there.
Brett I'll take the second one with respect to a potential tower process that maybe going on with T-Mobile sites.
Look as we always do we look at anything available in the market and we always underwrite transactions like that with a heavy view towards reinvesting those proceeds or that capital in our own business in the form of share purchases.
And so we would look at a relatively immature tower portfolio and back into what do you have to believe about future leasing to drive higher AFFO per share than we could have otherwise driven with those same proceeds in our business over a sort of a medium-term horizon.
Jay mentioned earlier in the question about our anticipated or expected conversion to a REIT that's our working assumption.
It becomes very simple around here then if you start thinking about what is the objective and the objective is to maximize the perspective dividend post 2016.
It's very simple.
And so we believe that's how we'll be measured.
We think that's the basis for the AFFO per share calculation that we're all undertaking today.
And so anything we do including the NextG acquisition we just closed we expect will drive a higher dividend capacity in the company in 2016 than otherwise we could have done with the other alternatives presented to us at that time.
So that's how we'll look at any acquisition and that's how we've done it in the past and you should assume that will continue.
Research Division</strong> And to just sort of summarize there.
If you were to do a very large transaction that may be required an equity component you would be willing to endure maybe a little near-term dilution around say AFFO per share so long as you had high confidence that by the time you are operating as a REIT you would be clearly better off than you otherwise would have been even if there were some M&amp;A risk in the portfolio you're buying? Sure.
In a theoretical sort of academic answer sure absolutely.
We don't draw any hard and fast lines about what we will or won't do but I'm happy to share with you what our objective is and that is to maximize the dividend capacity in a sort of a medium term when we think that's going to be so important.
And the next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> You raised your guidance for the year and you talked about the big 4 spending but can you just talk a little bit more about specifically Clearwire and T-Mobile who are both planning LTE builds but really haven't started yet.
Is that more of a 2013 2014 revenue opportunity or is that -- have you baked some of that into your $100 million underlying improvement for this year? And specifically on T-Mobile is this going to be a situation like Sprint where you need to negotiate a new MLA and where do you stand on that? Sure.
With respect to kind of current activity we haven't booked -- baked any of that into our future guidance into our outlook for the rest of the year.
So there's nothing going on within those 2 carriers in the order of magnitude of sort of a brand new LTE overlay that would suggest we put it in the guidance today.
We're still in the early front end of that.
We are seeing nice activity out of T-Mobile in what I would call the sort of a normal resumption of network enhancements and roaming overbuilds and things that they're doing.
So that's certainly nice to see.
We are on the front end and I don't think have not really commenced the process around the LTE overlay that they've described publicly.
And Simon I'm probably not going to get into a lot of detail on what our terms or MLA terms or things would look at.
There's certainly options around negotiating a new master agreement with them.
There's certainly the option to just proceed on a site by site basis sort of business as usual.
We've done both in the past and have been successful in both regard so we'll see what best suits them as we go forward but none of that is in the current guidance today.
And the next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions if I could.
First the wireless carriers in the U.S.
that have reported so far had kind of a light first quarter CapEx for wireless compared to where some of the equipment analysts' expectations were at.
Can you talk a little bit about what you saw you mentioned the 25% leasing applications but have you seen any kind of pause or slowdown? And then also talk to us maybe a little bit about your visibility that how your leasing would related to the CapEx spending cycle? Yes I think what we're -- the short answer is no we haven't seen any slowdown.
In fact to the contrary our application volume is up.
And when we give you the revenue that 25% that's a revenue comparison in terms of originated revenue.
The volume of activity is actually up beyond that in terms of numbers of application.
And so we see a very high level of engagement on the part of our customers.
Again we would be sort of the leading indicator if the application cycle takes sometimes 6 to 9 months to actually turn into revenue.
And so as we look out to the back half of the year we see a lot of activity turning into revenue.
I really couldn't speak to the equipment flows in terms of availability of equipment but that's just one component of a fairly long cycle time of doing the installations and the upgrades on the sites.
And so we are well underway with really all 3 and most recently in most volume being Sprint through their Network Vision activity that they've described.
It's very very busy around Crown Castle right now.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> That's good thanks.
On your full year guidance you updated a time on what the deal or acquisition impacts were on revenue site rental revenue and EBITDA.
How about can you address what the impact might have been on AFFO and maybe lump in the financing costs just so we can get gauge how much acquisitions plus financing? Sure Rick.
For the full year the impact of the increased in interest expense is about $70 million.
So you can net that off of the increase that we have in the acquisitions which is about $55 million or so.
Remember there's a bit of a timing difference.
We borrowed the money in January to prefund those acquisitions on a run rate basis.
The acquisitions are basically a push at the AFFO line.
So the growth in the base business is offset a little bit by the timing difference in when we began paying interest on the debt and when we closed on the acquisition but the rest of the base business is -- or if you want to think about it as a run rate on the fourth quarter of this year all of that growth in the base business falls through the AFFO line.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> That makes sense.
And any unusual straight line items? I know you've given us the reconciliation there as far as old guidance versus new guidance but was there anything unusual at either Wireless Capital Partners or with NextG coming up in next quarter's actuals? There's nothing related to those 2 acquisitions that should affect our straight line revenue in either WCP or in terms of NextG.
I think if you look at the change in straight line revenues from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year most of that movement is related to the timing of cash received.
Obviously this is one of the reasons why we're excited about focusing on FFO because it takes us down to the cash line and gets us out of some of the noise that we'll see from time to time up at the revenue and adjusted EBITDA line.
But directionally we think that that component of the noncash revenue is headed downward and obviously again that's the benefit of focusing on AFFO.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And one other quick question.
You mentioned how you look at stock buybacks versus deals.
You guys did a fairly noticeable amount of debt buyback both in the quarter end and April.
If I could just learn about what you're seeing there.
Was it to look at the leverage or what else? Sure.
That's just opportunistic financing frankly.
If you look at 2 components of our balance sheet the current coupon on the debt is wide of what the market would bear today if we were to go -- do a new issue.
There's the 9% notes which are issued by the holding company and then there's the 7 3/4 notes that senior secured notes that are issued by one of our subsidiary.
And both of those instruments I would expect over time that will go in and refinance and push into a longer data financing and lower the interest coupon.
And so the 9% note has a call date in January of 2013 so I would look at that as just opportunistically using our balance sheet our credit facility our revolving credit facility which we'll do over time and then ultimately we'll turn that out into a longer dated financing as the market allows.
And the next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> Just a couple if I could.
Jay just -- if you could just kind of help me think through.
If I take out the M&amp;A impact from the forward 2012 guidance the leftover is something like $18 million of increased revenue but $35 million of EBITDA.
If you could kind of just help us think about how we get that equation to balance between revenue and EBITDA? And then second just a couple on the deployment side.
One have you gotten any sense that like someone like a DISH who's looking at build requirements coming through the NPRM that will come out for their terrestrial build is doing the ground work to get ready to do something possibly in the next year or so? And the flip side to that item shutdown question Sprint shared that they had done about 600 cell sites in terms of their CDMA upgrade through the first quarter but they had thousands and thousands that were about to start coming online.
Could you kind of tell us how you -- how should we think about that build acceleration starting to kind of positively impact your growth through the rest of the year? Sure.
I'll take the first and the third and let Ben take the second one.
On the impact which we laid out and I think you've correctly discussed kind of the benefit of the base business and the reason why EBITDA is maybe higher than revenue.
Two reasons there.
One is on the cost side both site rental and direct cost and the benefit that managing G&amp;A appropriately for the balance of the year there is some benefit there.
As we talked about with the NextG acquisition we expect over time there'll be some synergy.
So we're getting some benefit there.
And then the second thing is from a services business contribution.
From the services business we obviously had a very good quarter in the first quarter and we slightly raised our expectation for the balance of future quarters based on the increased activity we're seeing in the site rental business.
So I think that's most of that.
And the third question around the guidance for the full year.
This is -- as Ben talked about this is something we haven't seen in a very very long period of time where you have all of the major carriers working on significant deployments.
And so as you think about AT&amp;T Verizon Sprint and T-Mobile all 4 of them are very active as they're either upgrading networks deploying new cell sites but really enhancing their wireless networks particularly as a result of all of the trends that Ben spoke about in the data space.
And so over the course of the year as we continue to roll here we've seen activity across the board from all of the carriers and that's why leasing activity was ahead of our expectation.
I hate to kind of zero in on any 1 of those 4 because I think the general trajectory of all of those 4 would appear to be higher than what we've seen in the past years for the balance of this year and that's reflected in the changes that we made to our forward outlook as well as the benefit that we saw in the first quarter.
And happy to give you maybe a little bit more clarity on how that plays out in the balance of the year but right now the tail it looks like a pretty strong tailwind for the balance of the year from all of us.
Yes.
And specifically Sprint we see a lot of activity as you indicated and that's certainly a factor in our outlook going forward.
Your second question David will be short on DISH.
We're in active dialogue with them.
I won't certainly attempt to speak for them or what their plans are on this call but we're very excited about the prospect of that spectrum ultimately coming to market in whatever form or partnership or structure that it may take.
We have assets and portfolio whether it be macro sites or small cells.
We are absolutely available and willing to work with them very aggressively on helping them deploy that spectrum.
And so it's exciting for us sort of at a high level that you have someone entertaining a business plan with a notion of wanting wireless service through a spectrum they've acquired.
Beyond that we'll have to wait and see exactly how the deployment plan looks.
And the next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> Can you delve a little more into the services business? It was pretty nice beat this quarter.
You said you did take it up a little bit but what in particular is -- has been the source of the improvement? Do you feel like you're a little conservative now going forward or could that even ramp a little further? Yes.
The services -- thanks for asking because it's a lot of work and we got a lot of people deploying working hard for customers on that effort but we're continuing to increase our take rate in terms of opportunities among carriers touching our sites and then increasing the scope of what we're actually doing in those individual installations.
And won't get into a whole lot of detail there but we've increased the scope of work that we're typically taking on for customers there.
We are always and I'm the first one on this topic we're always conservative about how we anticipate or forecast future growth there.
It's just difficult.
It's volume based it's transaction based and it's a discretionary purchase on the part of the carrier.
So it's a very difficult thing for us to forecast.
We are very pleased to see that its trajectory has been up and we've been doing very well with it.
And frankly the way we think about it is it covers a lot of overhead and a lot of the activities that we undertake to bring us closer to our customers in the high touch experience that they enjoy working with us but we are going to always sort of take a little bit of a haircut on our forward outlook until we ultimately deliver and maybe that provides a little bit of an upward surprise from time to time and that's a good thing.
We've been on the reverse of that as well as you remember.
So we're going to try to keep it on the side.
Research Division</strong> Can you remind me because I forget is that more a construction driven or is it more permitting and amendments driven? It's all of the above.
It's everything from permitting and zoning all the way through the construction management cycle of the installations that were the amendments on our sites.
It's really a turnkey process.
And the next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Two quick questions if I may.
First just a basic housekeeping question.
Can you remind me I think Sprint told us that they've done the zoning and permitting on about 10 000 of the 12 000 sites that they hope to build this year.
What point does it go into guidance for you guys? Is it once the zoning and permitting is complete? And then the second question I think we've heard very supportive comments from 3 of the major carriers so far this quarter about a much bigger push into small-cell networks.
What's a little bit unclear to me is in which situations they're building those networks from cells certainly in the case of PCS.
It sounded like that it was more of a build than using a third-party provider.
How do carriers decide between when they build it themselves or when they use something like NextG's assets to make those deployments? Sure Jonathan.
On your first question any of the carrier activity we put it into the outlook or into the guidance when we have reasonable basis to do so.
And that can either be based on the conversations we have with the carriers or alternatively when we have application.
The applications give us about 3 to 6 months worth of visibility.
And so as you're looking at any cycle early in the year now we would have pretty good visibility as to what the second quarter and a portion of the third quarter would look like in terms of the applications coming online.
The end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter activity would be largely based on conversation and that's true regardless of which carrier customer you're talking about.
To your next question on the interest on the part of the carriers around DAS networks and small cells here's how our experience has gone in terms of -- and we're gratified the see that basically we're involved in existing agreements and ongoing conversations with really all the major carriers at this point.
And the decision to purchase decision that they make in our experience is most largely driven by speed and execution capability which we are thrilled to death to tell you that in our judgment NextG is the best in class at that.
So in terms of getting networks on the air on time and on budget there's nobody better.
The second area that I think is incredibly compelling is what I was speaking about in my opening remarks around the nature of the shared wireless infrastructure model that we promote and utilized in the tower business where the carriers are able to spread the cost of data occupancy among their tenants their co-tenants on our towers.
The same is true in a DAS system where it's going to be much more economically efficient for one party in this case ourselves to own a system and share it among carriers in that market.
We are in a -- we believe have adequate or superior return above our sort of cost to capital for the effort and the risk profile we're undertaking.
But for each individual carrier it's a significantly less expensive proposition to occupy our site or our system than it is to try to build themselves.
I would say it's in that order that I suggested the first criteria given the network challenges is speed and execution capability.
But we always have an eye toward making sure that it's economically compelling for the customer so that we're always on the right side of that equation.
And so far we are very pleased with what we see.
Research Division</strong> So when they do deploy their own systems are they using them as multi-tenant systems and competing against your NextG assets if they build it it's exclusive.
Well it's very early days but there's certainly nothing preventing them from that.
I think experience and just logic would tell you their primary objective is to satisfy their own capacity challenge on their own network.
And to the extent co-location is an opportunity you have to ask them certainly on a venue in building situation that's often the case.
But there's a big market out there and we're certainly not going to be the only party in this business and we'll have a number of parties in the business as we have today as well as our carrier customers self providing building for themselves because frankly there's a lot of need out there and they can't always be met by the independent parties that are in the market.
And the next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
Research Division</strong> I was wondering if you could help us think through for the NextG business? For the revenue and the EBITDA how do we think about the revenue that comes from the long-term nature of the lease itself versus the accrual of revenue that's for the reimbursement of the capital spending that you're performing on behalf of the tenant and they're paying you upfront for that deployment of the equipment? Sure Mike.
Good question.
This is a -- I would describe it as a venue-by-venue discussion depending on where the system is built.
It's also a carrier by carrier conversation.
And so depending on what the desire of the venue and the economics of how that relationship is structured it can be structured as an upfront payment that's required to the venue in order to secure the system for the rights to build the system in the area.
Sometimes they would rather have a share of ongoing revenues.
Sometimes they would like a fixed ongoing payment in the future and that to some degree drives then the conversation that we have with the carriers when they are interested in going onto the systems.
It is typically structured like the tower business where most of the value is driven by ongoing revenues that are paid on the quarterly -- on a monthly basis over a long period of time.
Some portion of those revenues depending on -- largely dependent on how we think about the payments at the initial date to do that for capital deployment considerations or payments to the venue sometimes we'll ask them to pay a portion of their rent in the form of a prepaid rent that they pay day one.
And so I wouldn't describe there to be a norm yet in this industry.
My guess is after a couple of years there will be something that becomes more normalized but today it's a transaction-by-transaction basis.
And as we evaluate it we're looking at it on a return standpoint.
So as Ben described earlier in the conversation how we evaluate alternatives we can certainly talk about that on a broad basis around how we think about investments and buying back shares or tower acquisitions for DAS investments.
When you get down to the more specific level we would look at each individual transaction or opportunity that we may choose to bid on or not bid on based on the economics that we think are available there.
And that would be a combination of what are the economics to the venue and then what are the economics we're receiving from the carrier and then we balance those and strike a deal that we think delivers the appropriate return for the risk that we're taking.
Research Division</strong> And if you had to take a look at either the heritage tower portfolio you have versus the NextG is there a different percentage of revenue that comes from this sort of noncash I guess you call it CapEx reimbursement? So if you were to compare the 2 is that a meaningful difference in revenue contribution? Mike we've owned the NextG assets for a couple of weeks which is the majority of what we have in terms of DAS site.
And those only have one and a quarter tenant on them.
So I think that will probably be a question we'll be better able to answer over time as we structure more of these deals and negotiate with the carriers.
But right now it's such early days.
I think in general if you were to look at kind of past practice and kind of where we're at today the portion of prepaid rent that the carriers have been willing to pay broadly in the industry is maybe higher than traditional towers.
But keep in mind a lot of that was driven by the fact that a lot of the folks in the business were funded by private equity and so they really didn't have an opportunity or an ability to have capital put to work on behalf of the carriers like we do.
So my guess is that over time the migration will probably look more like the traditional tower business but it's so early that it's really hard to say that.
And again this is driven on a deal by deal economics and so I think we're looking at driving returns given a certain set of investment opportunities that are in front of us and maybe ultimately the carrier's view and desire is to go to a structure that looks more like paying a higher portion of the rent day one.
And we'd be open to that structure.
It just comes down to the economics and the returns around certain assets.
But I think honestly you're going to have to give us a little bit more time and we'll kind of see how the market develops.
Whatever develops ultimately gets washed out at the AFFO line though right because that's ultimately just cash.
So it's all about returns at the end of the day.
And the next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.
Research Division</strong> Just a quick couple of follow-ups.
First what were some of the onetime items that contributed to the $5 million help in the quarter? And also just a follow-up on the guidance I think the deed in the first quarter was about $7 million better on the base business but you shook out the acquisition benefits for the full year guidance the raise is about $12 million $13 million.
The reason that the bps slows down is that a function of the churn that you mentioned or is there any other items that takes it down? And last question I believe you said that you expect some margin dilution on the services business in the second quarter.
Can you talk about what would drive that? Sure.
On the onetime items there are things where we find as we do normal reviews of the portfolio we will find that the carrier has installed some equipment that maybe we weren't notified about and so there will be some nonrecurring benefit that we'll pick up revenue from the last time that we ought to visit the site and they pay us for that.
Some of it is just timing around when leases get into the system against when they were installed on the site.
So there's always going to be a little bit of that noise.
It's a little higher this quarter honestly than what it normally is.
Normally we're in the kind of 2 to 3 range and up at 5 in the first quarter.
So a little higher than the normal but not completely unusual.
The impact for the balance of the year I mean I spoke to the question earlier around how much visibility we have.
We certainly had a very good first quarter.
We have pretty good visibility based on applications for about 3 to 6 months.
And for the last half of the year we're just doing it based on either conversations we've had directly with the carriers or what they've said publicly and we've maybe mitigated a little bit from current levels of activity in the back half of the year and the outlook we gave and we'll just kind of see how it develops.
And then in your last question around how the services business performs and why we're assuming that it's down.
As Ben spoke to there's a lot of volatility there and we don't have as much visibility or clarity on exactly the services that the carriers will engage -- gauge us to do.
So we're generally pretty conservative in terms of the outlook that we give.
If you were looking at it in past periods and you were to look at changes either up or down that's largely indicative of the movements in the carrier's leasing activity and how much deployments they have going on.
So in periods where the carriers are deploying more equipment they're busier when they offload more of that work to us.
Where there's not as much activity going on those would be reflected in slowdowns in that business.
That's the generalization.
But as we give outlook we're generally pretty conservative against that.
So sometimes there's a bit of a divergence between what we talked about in terms of lease applications and that environment and then what we baked into our outlook for our services business.
All right.
Thanks.
I think with that we're right at the bottom of the hour.
I know it's a busy time so we'll let everybody jump.
Thanks for joining us on the call.
We've got a lot going on look forward to the rest of the year and some exciting things happening at Crown Castle.
So have a great rest of the day.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the conference call for today.
Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.
Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to the Crown Castle International Q2 2012 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today Thursday July 26 2012 at 9:30 a.m.
Central time.
I'll now turn the conference over to Ms.
Fiona McKone VP Corporate Finance and IR.

In addition today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA funds from operations funds from operations per share adjusted funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations per share.
Tables reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures are available under the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.
With that I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
Let me start with a few summary comments as outlined on Slide 3 and then I'll go through our results and outlook in greater detail.
As you see from our press release we had an excellent second quarter exceeding the high end of our previously issued guidance for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
We continue to make good progress with the integration of NextG and the WCP assets we acquired earlier this year and are excited by the ongoing deployments of wireless data networks.
The strong year-to-date results and our expectations for the second half of the year allow us to meaningfully increase our 2012 outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
Turning to Slide 4.
During the second quarter we generated site rental revenue of $518 million up 13% from the second quarter of 2011.
New tenant additions increased site rental revenue by 6% reflecting the increased leasing activity driven by the 4 major carriers upgrading their networks.
And the remaining 7% growth came from our 2 recent acquisitions.
The contribution to site rental revenues from these acquisitions was approximately $6 million higher in the quarter than we had previously expected.
Further we were able to achieve certain cost synergies related to these acquisitions quicker than we had previously anticipated.
Site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues less cost of operations was $386 million up 15% from the second quarter of 2011.
Further our network services continue to exceed our expectations reflecting the level of network upgrade activity in the market.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2012 was $379 million up 18% from the second quarter of 2011.
As shown on Slide 5 AFFO was $215 million up 19% from the second quarter of 2011.
And adjusted funds from operations per share was $0.74 up 17% from the second quarter of 2011.
Further while there were no significant nonrecurring items in the second quarter I would note that we collected approximately $5 million in cash in the second quarter that we had previously expected to collect in the third quarter which benefited our AFFO results in the second quarter.
Turning to investments and liquidity as shown on Slide 6.
During the second quarter we spent $95 million on capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $29 million on our land lease purchase program.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 77% of our gross margin.
We believe this activity is a core competency of Crown Castle and continue to enjoy significant success with this program as evidenced by the fact that today 39% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own up from less than 15% in January of 2007.
Further the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years.
We continue to focus a significant amount of effort and capital on purchasing land beneath our towers and extending our ground leases.
Of the other remaining capital expenditures we've spent $7 million on the sustaining capital expenditures and $58 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures the latter consisting of $30 million on existing sites and $28 million on the construction of new sites primarily distributed antenna system deployments.
Further during the second quarter we used $51 million of cash to purchase a portion of our 9% senior notes and 7.75% senior secured notes including make-whole costs at prices we found attractive relative to these bonds' respective call dates.
We ended the second quarter of 2012 with total net debt-to-last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 5.5x and adjusted EBITDA-to-cash interest expense of 3.1x.
As you saw in our press release last night we reached an agreement with T-Mobile USA to extend the remaining term on all 7 300 existing leases to 10 years and granted T-Mobile rights to upgrade certain towers with radio equipment in connection with their network modernization plan.
We expect this agreement to contribute approximately $20 million in site rental revenue to our second half 2012 results.
Moving to the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2012 as shown on Slide 7 and 8.
We expect site rental revenue of between $530 million and $535 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $387 million and $392 million for the third quarter of 2012.
Turning to our full year 2012 outlook.
Based on our year-to-date results and our visibility into near-term leasing activity we have meaningfully increased our full-year 2012 outlook from what we provided in April increasing site rental revenue by $43 million site rental gross margin by $36 million and adjusted EBITDA by $63 million.
This increase in our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is driven by a number of factors including higher run rate site rental revenues than we had previously expected the benefit from the aforementioned T-Mobile agreement better-than-expected contribution from our recent acquisitions and the expectation of continued strong performance from our service equipment [ph].
I'm delighted with the performance of our business and our increased expectations for the balance of 2012.
We now expect 2012 year-over-year site rental revenue growth of 13% an adjusted EBITDA growth of 17% and AFFO growth of 16%.
We expect to augment our AFFO growth through opportunistic investments and activities such as share purchases tower acquisitions new site construction and land purchases.
Consistent with our past practice our outlook does not include the benefit from these expected investments.
As shown on Slide 9 for 2012 we expect to generate approximately $850 million of AFFO and invest approximately $350 million on capital expenditures related to purchases of land beneath our towers the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites including distributed antenna systems.
Ignoring our borrowing capacity the portion of our AFFO after expected capital expenditures represents $125 million per quarter of cash flow that we could invest in activities related to our core business including purchases of our shares and acquisitions.
As such we remain focused on our investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.
I believe that this level of capital investment can add between 4% and 6% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate annually.
In summary we had an excellent second quarter as we continue to execute around our core business and we are very excited about the balance of 2012.
With that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay.
And thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
As Jay just mentioned we had an excellent second quarter exceeding the outlook for site rental revenues site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
And we are excited about our business as we look forward to the balance of the year.
As you know there's a significant amount of activity in our industry currently as all 4 major U.S.
wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously and we are enjoying unprecedented visibility into future revenue growth as evidenced in our increased guidance.
In fact leasing activity grew 15% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year.
The big 4 U.S.
carriers accounted for approximately 81% of our growth in the second quarter.
And as expected amendments made up approximately 90% of their activity in the quarter as they continue to focus on upgrading their networks.
Further as Jay mentioned we recently reached an agreement with T-Mobile USA to extend the remaining term on all 7 300 existing leases to 10 years and granted T-Mobile rights to upgrade certain towers with radio equipment in connection with their network modernization plan.
We're obviously thrilled with our relationship with T-Mobile and look forward to assisting them in building out their network modernization plan.
We'll be working very hard to ensure we achieve the operational efficiencies and deployment speed that both parties intended through this agreement.
As the largest single provider of sites to the largest -- to the 4 largest wireless carriers in the U.S.
we expect to receive an outsized benefit from the significant 4G upgrade activity from all of the carriers which we believe is reflected in our current results and updated outlook.
In addition to the continued growth of our site leasing business I'm very pleased that our services business continues to perform very well reflecting the significant level of network upgrade activity in the market.
This success results from a diligent effort to capture more of the opportunities to assist our customers in all aspects of the installation process on our sites.
This increase in services activity is attributable to the confidence our customers have in Crown Castle as regularly expressed in our customer surveys that consistently rank us as delivering the highest customer satisfaction in the industry.
This doesn't just happen by itself and I want to thank all of our employees for this terrific result.
Further in the second quarter we made significant progress with the integration of NextG and the WCP assets acquired earlier this year.
The integration of the WCP assets is complete and the integration of NextG is on track and proceeding very well.
I'm pleased that we've been able to retain approximately 75% of the NextG employees and have built a DAS and small-cell solutions organization we think is second to none around these core NextG employees.
While these integration activities are ongoing the business opportunity continues to grow.
And today we have over 2 000 nodes in the pipeline.
The acquisition of NextG positions us as an industry leader in distributed antenna systems and builds on the DAS success we have already enjoyed.
We're excited about our future prospects for the combined organization as a market leader in this new extension of our business.
I believe our strategy of focusing on the U.S.
market positions us well for the growth I believe lies ahead.
The U.S.
continues to lead in the deployment of 4G technology with 4G -- with LTE networks well under way and is the largest and fastest-growing market for the mobile Internet.
As demand for data services is concentrated in the major cities we feel we are best positioned to capture this opportunity with the highest concentration of sites and DAS nodes among our peers in the top 100 markets with 71% of our towers located in the top 100 BTAs where a significant share of the incremental leasing demand from LTE activity originates.
As demonstrated in our current results I believe our tower portfolio and the ability to execute for customers in the U.S.
allows us to capture this activity in the form of site leasing revenue growth as the carriers continue to upgrade and add sites to meet this increase in consumer demand for the mobile Internet.
Importantly the shared infrastructure model that is the foundation of our business provides the wireless carriers the most cost-effective way to deploy network capacity thereby allowing them to deploy 4G technology faster and at a lower cost than they otherwise would able to do.
Further as indicated by quarterly surveys from our customers we continue to deliver the highest customer service in the industry.
The combination of our customer-focused approach together with the best assets in the industry allows us to maximize the opportunity in the U.S.
market.
In summary we had a great second quarter.
We have made terrific progress in integrating these recent acquisitions and we are excited about our company's position relative to the significant growth occurring in the U.S.
market.
Further as Jay indicated we remain focused on investing activities that we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.
With that operator I think we are pleased to take some questions.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Clay Moran from Benchmark Company.
LLC Research Division</strong> Two questions Ben.
First off can you just explain how the straight-line revenue guidance changed from the first quarter to the second quarter? It's up significantly more than the $20 million from T-Mobile.
What's driving that? Sure I'll -- I'll let Jay have a crack at that.
Sure.
Yes Clay thanks for the question.
As we -- we've got now basically 2 ways to look at our results.
One way is from a traditional GAAP standpoint.
So you can look at our results in the top line site rental revenue growth down through adjusted EBITDA.
And then we've also provided the detail reconciling to an AFFO metric which is more of a cash metric.
So you can look at it either way.
Specifically there are basically 2 things that are driving the movements quarter-to-quarter.
One of them is the T-Mobile agreement that we talked about which is an increase in the site rental revenues that we'll see at the GAAP line of about $20 million in the second half of the year.
The contribution on the cash side is about $1 million.
And as we noted in the press release those 2 numbers will converge over the next approximately 4 years.
The other item relates to the timing on cash collections and it's a relatively new metric for us.
So we may be a tad bit conservative in terms of how we assume cash flows are going to come in over time.
We obviously did better than what we expected in the second quarter.
We probably frankly pulled through in the second quarter some of what we had previously expected to get in the third and fourth quarter.
So over time we'll probably get a little bit better at predicting exactly the timing of those.
But it's -- in essence we've added almost the working capital component to that metric.
But pleased about the growth and I think you can look at it on a year-over-year basis and see that on either way you want to look at it whether you want to look at it on a more traditional income statement operating results basis or if you'd like to look at it on a cash basis both of those line items are growing nicely.
LLC Research Division</strong> And then second thing can you just remind us about your master lease agreements with the 4 national carriers? Do you have all 4 under MLAs now? And secondly the -- it sort of contracts out the revenue can you talk about what percentage of the opportunity you think is recognized by these MLLs (sic) [MLAs] sort of already under contract compared to what you see maybe in your CCI sites analysis? And then secondly I mean you have a heavy contracted revenue base now I assume.
Can you talk about what that looks like and what it implies for the cash and GAAP growth rates going forward? Sure Clay.
I'll try to take a crack at some of those.
First of all yes we are pleased that with the signing of the T-Mobile agreement we now have all 4 major carriers under long-term MLAs related -- and with rights to expand their network and add equipment to our site -- our sites.
I haven't seen our draft yet or the Q but I think with this T-Mobile we'd still be probably in the range of 9 years average life remaining and probably over $15 billion of committed revenue.
Stand by for the Q on that next week.
But it's a significant commitment and obviously makes us very comfortable with the long-term predictability of the revenue stream.
The other thing you mentioned though is around this now as Jay was talking about you can pick your GAAP metrics you can pick your cash metrics whichever you like.
Naturally when you extend the contract out 10 years as we have 10 to 12 or 15 years with all the major carriers there's going to be a significant amount of straight-line impact to that -- so again for those that may not be as close to it -- revenue recognized before the cash is received because we're required straight-line that escalation.
But when you look at the AFFO number obviously that's all normalized for that.
So if there's a significant amount of this straight-line revenue hung up on the books then what you can expect is you'll see a significant amount of growth in AFFO as those natural escalators come through over the remaining years.
And so I think we can look forward to seeing AFFO just sort of have a natural built-in organic growth even before the market growth that we're excited to be seeing out there.
And then the last point around -- I'll try to quantify for you how much of the growth we've already -- we sort of guide in the numbers I wouldn't be able to do that for you.
I am -- we've sort of missed that every time we looked at it honestly.
There's a lot going on that is driven by consumer demand for data services.
And that's requiring continued upgrade of sites expansion of existing -- of original footprints on what the original upgrades were going to look like.
And then we fully expect that at some point in the future we're going to see cell splitting which will result we think in material co-locations around back to your CCI sites analysis on where we believe there our existing towers that can accommodate additional demand where a carrier has a need in a market particularly around capacity and cell splitting.
And that even leaves out the conversation around the whole DAS nodes and the small-cell business that we've made a very large investment in and are very pleased with the prospects there.
So we have very high expectations for that business.
As we've told you before we think that could account for 20% to 25% of our growth going forward.
And for such a relatively small component of our company today that's significant outsized growth relative to its size.
And so I wouldn't be able to guess for you how much is pre-sold.
We are very busy as you can tell with the service level of activity.
We're going about as fast as we can right now.
We're going to add the T-Mobile application volume into the pipeline.
Very very pleased about that.
We're going to be adding some resources around that to accommodate that.
And so it's a very good time to be working for all 4 carriers as they work to build out their networks.
Your next question comes from David Barden from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> The -- so first thing when I saw the T-Mobile announcement Ben is it kind of just said to me that in terms of the risks of consolidation between Sprint and T-Mobile or Sprint and TCS or AT&amp;T and Leap that we've kind of feared about this industry for a really long time it kind of struck me that maybe we've just de-risked this industry with respect to the consolidation issue for a long time.
And I just wanted to sanity check that to make sure that there aren't change-of-control issues or other kinds of contractual wiggles that would make that an overreach in terms of interpretation.
I guess -- and then second question I had was just with respect to monetizing the T-Mobile relationship.
I guess you've given them rights to certain towers.
I guess could you kind of elaborate a little bit on how much room you have to monetize the things that T-Mobile does with the network through time a little bit more clearly? That'd be great.
Sure.
First of all I think your interpretation is correct.
These contracts with all the carriers basically are committed for that primary term and with as I said depending on the carrier 10 years 12 years or 15 years.
And so these are committed contracts that would obviously have to be satisfied in any scenario you can come up with.
Secondly with respect to the T-Mobile agreement we've disclosed the fact that the agreement gives them rights to modernize and upgrade certain towers.
It's less than 100%.
But we've been asked not to share any further details because we don't want to get into any of their particular proprietary upgrade plans.
And so we're not going to go further in terms of talking about exactly what their plan is and the pace and all of that.
I would clarify 1 thing around the $20 million of impact on a revenue basis this year.
That is broken out.
Roughly about 1/3 of that is attributable to the straight-line impact of the renewal of the underlying base contracts.
And then the other 2/3 of that $20 million would be attributable to the recognition of the commitment around the amendment activity or the rights to upgrade the towers.
So that's for a little further clarification for you all.
But beyond that we're really not going to get into their specific rollout plan and what exact rights they have acquired from us.
Research Division</strong> And so just to clarify that last point Ben that is to say that for the go-forward upgrade of the network which includes the remote radio head-ins under their architecture plans you're charging them more money and then your straight lining that increase in the rents and that's 2/3 of the $20 million? That's correct.
Would you add anything to that Jay? Okay.
Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> Yes on T-Mobile just to follow up and then a question on Australia.
And so can you maybe give us a sense as to what the 2013 annualized AFFO contribution would be from the master lease agreement that you signed with T-Mobile? And does concluding that MLA mean that you're not interested in the potential purchase of their towers? Yes Jonathan.
On the first question there I guess the way I would describe it is as we've previously disclosed in about 4 years those 2 numbers are going to be approximately equal.
I don't think we're going to be so specific about disclosing the contractual terms of that stat [ph].
As we have done with all of the carriers we've taken a view -- and these are -- these kind of transactions are relatively new to the tower industry.
You'll remember historically when carriers would go through the next upgrade cycle they would typically want to pay us on a one-off basis.
And so you would go through -- as we went through each amendment cycle the carrier would come to us and we would negotiate on a one-off basis for each individual tower.
I think over the years the carriers have gotten to the place where they believe that there's great value to trying to accomplish those cycles with greater speed and ease.
And so over the last several years as we've done with each of the carriers we've gone through the process of delineating exactly what kind of equipment do they want to add to the towers what time line do they want to accomplish that over.
And then contractually we work that through in something that's relatively easy for us to help them move at the pace and speed at which they want to.
So I think at the end of the day really this is going to look like a market value transaction as the previous ones have that we've done.
It's just contractually we've accomplished it in a way that hopefully makes it a little bit easier for them to deal with us.
And some of that we think financially the returns have been there and are reflected in our results.
And then we think the other benefit of it as Ben has mentioned on the speed side it's reflected in our carrier customer surveys where they believe we've accomplished this in a way that makes it -- makes us easier to do business with.
Just trying to make it a little simpler.
Then secondly Jonathan your question about a prospective T-Mobile tower sale honestly I wouldn't have any comment on that at all honestly.
LLC Research Division</strong> And then Australia slowed down in terms of the leaking [ph] sequentially.
I just wondered if you can recap some of the operating factors that are causing that.
Yes there's nothing hidden there.
We've got a lot of going on in Australia.
It's just not all in the revenue stream yet.
The backlog in the pipeline is building.
And we don't give specific guidance on Australia but I'm very pleased to say that I think you're going to see significant growth finally after a pretty good flat spot for the last couple of years.
While all the carriers are actively managed -- upgrading their network there's going to be more spectrum and we are really excited about the prospects for the next 3 years there.
It's relatively small it's about 5% of the total so we don't spend a lot of time on this call talking about it.
We spend a little bit of time working on it though and our team down there certainly does.
And I think you're going to see by the time we get to the end of this year materially higher run rate and we're really pleased about that.
LLC Research Division</strong> And finally on DAS maybe update us on how many nodes you operate and how that business has scaled since you closed on the NextG acquisition.
And has the growth been primarily indoor or outdoor? Yes probably not going to reconcile each node for you just give you directionally that the pipeline continues to build.
We've spent a lot of time obviously on integration activity getting the folks set up getting their organizations set up at the same time managing a significant amount of backlog that NextG brought with them that we had on our side as well.
We're seeing good activity both indoor and outdoor.
Everything we had expected in the sort of our underwriting fees is about that investment.
It's early days but it's coming true in terms of the carriers' desire to add small cells as a solution to provide capacity in places where macro tower sites won't suffice.
We've taken the market through that in a lot of the detailed discussion we're not going to repeat but we're very excited about what we see there.
And can't stress enough particularly if they're listening the talent that we've acquired with NextG we're thrilled about.
And combined with our execution capability and balance sheet frankly the ability to fund this going forward we think we've got a winning team.
LLC Research Division</strong> Is there significant room to improve on the I'll call it co-location cycle time? Or have you already -- or had NextG already realized these sorts of improvements over the last several years? Yes I think there's -- the real opportunity here is to additional tenants on existing systems at the same time building more systems.
And we're working hard to bring that cycle time down.
NextG is -- was the master at speed in terms of building.
And the talent that's now resident in our shop around that we think we've got a really good formula for going fast.
Again it requires a carrier to have a need.
And depending on the carrier and the location that need is in various stages of maturity.
But we think it's certainly coming towards us and I'm really excited about what we see.
Your next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> It's Richard Choe for Phil.
Just wanted to ask what the level of activity was outside of the big 4 in the quarter.
And are you expecting any kind of pickup and is that in the guidance? Yes Richard as I mentioned about 80% or so of our activity were the big 4.
So that leaves 20% for the rest.
And it's pretty steady with what we saw last year.
I mean it's not huge but it's -- there's some work going on.
And I wouldn't get into it to reconcile it customer by customer.
The big 4 represent about 80% of our activity right now but there certainly is work going on at the Clearwire level Metro PCS and Leap.
So I wouldn't diminish that in any way shape or form.
They certainly rely on us and we rely on them for accomplishing their network objectives.
Research Division</strong> And with the strong network services revenue is that coming from one carrier or multiple carriers? Can you give us a little color on that and how it should trend for maybe the third quarter and the rest of the year? It's a good broad-based mix across really all the carriers.
As you can imagine we're very busy on Sprint Network Vision right now.
We anticipate moving forward with T-Mobile as that application volume starts to load up now that we've got this agreement signed.
We've been very active and pleased with the relationships with Verizon and AT&amp;T.
So given the visibility we have evidenced by the guidance we've put out and the implied network services business growth and the EBITDA guidance for the balance of the year we feel pretty good about the visibility for the second half of this year and frankly on into next year.
We'll just -- we'll have to see.
As we all know if you're a history -- student of history in this business you know that can be volatile sometimes.
And so we're always a little bit careful about how we forecast that.
But given the activity in the market right now we're sort of in unprecedented times with the activity and the opportunity on the services side.
Richard specifically in the outlook we've assumed in the third quarter that we get a contribution from the services business very similar to what we had in the second quarter.
And then in the fourth quarter the contribution from services is expected to be down about $5 million.
And as Ben mentioned as we get further away from the data which we are at currently in predicting that sort of margin it becomes more difficult to predict exactly where it's going to be.
So we're -- we'll generally haircut current levels as we go out further.
So fourth quarter is a step down from Q3; Q3 about the same with Q2.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And for the last question you talked about the 2 000-node pipeline.
What is the timing of -- that we can see that coming online? And when might it make a noticeable impact? Are we talking much further out or something more near term as -- now that things start to ramp back up.
Typically that pipeline will look like between 18 and 24 months.
And obviously there's nodes coming online every day.
And then we're continuing to build the pipeline.
When we bought NextG the pipeline was right around 500 nodes.
We've put a number on air and have continued to build the pipeline.
But I would say generally we've got about 18 to 24 months in that pipeline.
Your next question comes from James Ratcliffe from Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Two if I could.
First of all you highlighted NextG and WCP synergies.
Should we look at it as a change in the trend line of EBITDA that you think you get out of those businesses going forward or more of a timing to capture of the synergies? And secondly could you update us regarding land assets for the towers that are on leased land what the mix of owners of those land pieces are and what level of concentration there is.
Sure.
James on your first question around synergy yes it's bringing forward synergies that we had previously thought would take us longer to accomplish.
On a run rate basis we've now got about $200 million a quarter related to the acquisitions that we've put in.
When we underwrote the transaction we had assumed it would take us much longer than that to accomplish it.
As Ben mentioned we brought across 75% of the employees.
So a lot of that synergies that we have achieved is frankly  non-people-related costs.
And there are -- there may be still some additional synergies here but we certainly didn't do this transaction for synergies.
So I wouldn't want to hold out hope that there's a lot more synergies to come.
Most of this is really around the activity and opportunity that we see in the DAS business.
Your second question around -- yes well I appreciate you noticed.
We continue to work very hard on that front and find -- and have found a great deal of success.
We started this program very early in the industry.
And so as we look at the number of sites that are in the hands of third-party acquirers of ground leases it's a very very small number.
The vast majority of our sites to the extent that they're still on leased land is 60% that are on leased land.
Those sites would almost entirely be outside the hands of third-party acquirers of ground leases.
So we're typically dealing with an individual who just controls 1 or 2 sites.
So there's just a very small number of sites in concentrated hands.
Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss from Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
First back to the T-Mobile MLA.
It looks like the T-Mobile is maybe more reminiscent of the AT&amp;T transaction than the Sprint MLA from the standpoint of you've done the step function up for T-Mobile NT it appears whereas the Sprint one was more touch it as you go.
Is that the correct way of thinking of it? Yes I think it is.
I mean I think it's exactly how Jay was describing it.
And we find a lot of value and our customers do in simplicity.
And so if we can contract upfront for basically what the payment what the value of that amendment is going to be then it removes sort of all of the paperwork just in pricing individual sites.
They know what they have.
They can -- we can both go as fast as we possibly can and not get tripped up with paperwork in the interim on pricing individual sites.
So it provides certainty in -- of pricing to them and then the requirement for us is we have to book it obviously if it's a commitment.
But for everyone's benefit again you've got full disclosure.
There's the GAAP numbers if you like or there's the cash numbers if you like.
So you can look at revenue and EBITDA all of which will eventually turn to cash.
Or you can look at AFFO which would be the natural growth through those payments.
Whether they're structured as actual fees for sites as they come on board or whether they're embedded in the escalator just a gross step escalator it frankly doesn't matter.
You're going to see it in the very same way.
It's going to be a contribution to AFFO over time.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Good.
And then maybe looking at that certain towers again.
So they've committed to all 7 300 sites but the radio modernization site is only on certain sites.
I know you said you can't really get into a lot of specifics because T-Mobile doesn't want you to.
Maybe look at it this way.
T-Mobile has said publicly they want to touch 37 000 of their 50 000-or-so cell sites in this phase in '12 and '13.
Does your certain number include all of those that are in their 37 000 or just a certain subset of that? Just I'm not trying to put a number into it but just trying to understand.
.
.
Yes I understand Rick.
I understand.
And we're not able to give you that detail.
And so there's a little bit of a question for all of you as to well is there any upside beyond what we've just reported.
And I would argue that that'll depend on T-Mobile's success and their own deployment plans and we'll just have to wait and see.
But I would ask you to respect their confidence and they've asked us to keep it between us what their deployment plans are.
And so that -- those questions are probably better directed towards them.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Sure.
No it doesn't hurt asking.
Yes.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> The final question for me is Jay you mentioned how you have kind of $120 million per quarter available cash to use for the buyback M&amp;A site building land et cetera.
As you think about potential transactions out there does that then limit you to $250 million or so in the second half of the year? Where would you take leverage for the right transaction? I'm just trying to understand kind of where you see the balance sheet versus the potential use of funds.
Sure.
No it's definitely not a limitation the $125 million a quarter.
I think it's just the -- think of it as a baseline for the amount that we would expect to spend around the acquisitions or share purchases or frankly maybe increasing CapEx around distributed antenna systems or other areas.
As we think about the capacity that we've built into the balance sheet and we've historically talked about a target level of leverage as somewhere between 4 to 6x debt-to-EBITDA we're now in a position of basically approaching kind of the midpoint there.
So we have some capacity that we could use to -- on a transaction that we thought was attractive.
And each of the things that we look at whether it's share purchases or tower acquisition they go through the same filter.
And the first filter is around weighing the various merits of alternatives.
And any acquisition that we would look at has to pass the test of showing more accretion than we could have otherwise achieved by buying back our own towers via share purchases.
And once we get past that measure then it comes down to a question of how do we want to finance that particular activity whether it's share purchase or -- share purchases or tower acquisitions.
And as we've said over time depending on what the returns are there's a possibility that we may go a little bit outside of that targeted level of leverage for the right opportunity.
As we did with NextG.
As we did with NextG the -- and WCP which we financed both of those with debt and cash flow as long as we have a path towards quickly getting back inside that targeted level of leverage.
So I think certainly we're not going back to the early days of the tower industry and wouldn't expect to see us go much beyond -- from a covenant standpoint I should say we can't go outside of 7x debt-to-EBITDA.
So there's sort of a cap there on how far outside of the target level of range could we go for any particular activity.
But we'd be willing to go above that targeted level of leverage for the right opportunity but have historically tried to manage the business inside that targeted level of leverage.
I think that also that goes back to the previous conversation about the contracted revenue stream we have.
When you start thinking about leverage with 9-plus years of contracted revenue it makes you a little more comfortable with leverage particularly given the cost to leverage that.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And the cost of debt is still staying pretty attractive out there? Yes I think if we were to finance today in the high-yield space it would start with a 5 and we'd been somewhere in the 5s today.
The bank market continues to be pretty healthy.
I think we have a number of opportunities.
The structured loan market is attractive.
I think we have a number of different markets where we could go and finance ourselves.
Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> When you put out guidance for this year you did talk about some churn coming through I think primarily from Alltel.
Perhaps can you just update us on what was the impact in the quarter.
Is that all pretty much done with at this point? And I think you also suggested that there will be limited upgrade activity or renewal activity versus some prior years.
Obviously you've got this big T-Mobile contract but perhaps give us again midway through the year how that's all playing out versus your expectations.
Sure.
In the first half of the year -- and we mentioned this in the last quarter call.
In the first quarter churn was lower than what we had previously expected.
And in the second quarter churn came in lower than what we had expected.
So we did a little better in the first half of the year than what we had expected.
Our outlook for the full year assumed that about 20% of the churn we would see in 2012 would occur in the first 6 months of the year and 30% in the back half of the year.
We've not changed our assumptions for the churn in the back half of the year.
So I think for the full year if you were trying to reconcile to our prior comments that we made going into the year we would expect churn to be better than what we had previously expected.
Research Division</strong> And is that because the -- whoever -- they're being advised or whatever they have decided just to keep those sites for their own use or...
Well what I would tell you is across the board that happens.
We go into any given year and we have -- similar to the leasing side we -- we're only going to have about 3 to 6 months' worth of visibility around how carriers are thinking about leases as they come up for renewal.
And as they come up for renewal we'll start to try to estimate what it's going to look like.
Sometimes they tell us.
And again we probably had a situation in the first half of the year similar to what we've seen over time.
And that is while they may talk about taking down sites.
Ultimately they take down a few less than what they maybe had originally had planned or articulated.
And I think the same thing happened to us in the first 6 months of the year.
And we'll just -- we'll update you as we go but I think back half of the year has a lighter impact from churn.
The second part of your question in terms of what do we expect to see in the second half of the year no I don't think there are any large renewals to be accounted for in the outlook certainly beyond what we've talked about or alluded to and don't think we'll have any at least that we know of or planned items that would move the numbers other than the typical organic activity that we would see in the business.
Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> And just to clarify one last point here on guidance we've been speculating before about the potential impact of T-Mobile's LTE upgrade.
As a result of the MLA that is in your guidance now for the second half of the year correct? Right that's correct yes.
Research Division</strong> And based on the way it's structured it seems like it's somewhat irrelevant how quickly they move through the balance of 2012.
You've pretty much have locked in what you're going to get paid? That's correct.
Right committed.
That's correct.
Research Division</strong> And then just to follow up on the question I had I think on your last call when I asked about NextG now that you've had the sort of operations under your control for a while and you have a much bigger funnel here of nodes have you started to reassess the way the contracts are written? For example are you starting to become more of a capital provider around the build-out and therefore taking in higher recurring fees? Because that's really the opposite of the way NextG had built its business as an independent company.
Yes I'd say directionally Brett that's going to happen over time.
It's not dramatic.
And again you probably wouldn't see that in our reported results anyway because it's all revenue.
Whether they make a contribution upfront or they put it all in rent that's all revenue to us that runs through the P&amp;L.
So you probably wouldn't be able to detect that from the statements.
But I am going to confirm to you that I think over time you'll see that move more towards a rent model less towards a capital-upfront model.
I wouldn't -- I don't know how fast it's going to move.
But I would emphasize also that we think the shared economics of the tower model absolutely are in play in the DAS model.
And so the whole attractiveness of a third-party independent owner like ourselves being involved is that we can effectively share the economics among multiple carriers exactly the way we do with the tower model.
And that becomes very compelling.
Particularly when you stack against -- on top of the economics the difficulty of siting of getting systems built installing the fiber and the value of the pole attachments and everything once you have that system built that's a very valuable asset.
And then to the extent you can make that very attractive from a perspective of economics that it's ultimately the shared model we think is very compelling and drives co-location in a very significant way as well as new node opportunities which we're seeing no shortage of right now.
Brett I think your question last quarter if I remember it correctly was around how have things changed in the DAS space.
And in the early days of these distributed antenna businesses they were either funded by private equity or very very lowly capitalized firms and they were trying to build these systems with basically 0 cash out-of-pocket from the firms building the systems.
And we are obviously willing to put capital at risk in order to drive and think about the business on a longer-term basis.
So today when we're building the systems we're putting real capital at risk beyond any capital that would be received from carriers associated with building those systems.
Then -- and then our returns are accomplished by making these multi-tenant systems rather than in the early days with a lot of these distributed antenna systems businesses where they were trying to basically make a return with a single carrier and get all of their capital back they won.
We've taken a very different approach.
And I think generally across-the-board in the industry it's become -- it's starting to look more and more like the tower industry.
I think we think over time that will continue to happen with the one caveat as we've -- I think I mentioned last time to you: some of this business is driven by what venue are you putting the activity into.
And so there are certain venues and locations where the upfront amounts become far more important to a venue or to a -- to the provider of the space than ongoing rents.
And so we will structure the receipts of cash with carriers more commensurate with what the underlying venue or owner desires.
But generally as Ben said we are generally moving towards the traditional tower model where we put real capital at risk and our returns are achieved by sharing.
Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> So 2 quick clarifying questions.
First on the accounting for the T-Mobile transaction.
It looks like about 100% of the revenue in 2012 is noncash.
So does that mean that it all gets booked as escalators? And then my second question was again on the 2 000 nodes.
Could you give us just a rough sense? I'm assuming that those aren't in guidance.
Can you give us a rough sense for assuming those come on what 2 000 nodes would generate in incremental revenue and EBITDA? Yes in your first question I think the way I would describe it is the uplift to revenues is an indication of what will ultimately be collected in cash in future periods.
And so in a simple example Jonathan if the carrier were going to pay us $100 in year 1 and $105 in year 2 then on the GAAP revenue lines we would record $102.5 in each of those 2 years.
So in the first year there would be $2.50 of if you thought about it this way noncash revenues.
And in the second period your cash receipts of $105 would be greater than the GAAP revenue line.
So you would have in essence $5 of cash and $2.5 more of cash than you did showing up in the GAAP statement.
So that's what we're saying.
And by telling you that it takes about 4 years or so until those numbers get back then you have some estimation of how long that's going to take.
Frankly on the backside of it you're in the reverse position.
So in the second half of the agreement in the years beyond 4 years what will happen is your cash receipts will be greater than that recognized on the income statement.
So I think over time you -- and I think it's always helpful to look at more than one metric.
But over time I think people can look at either just looking at the operating results and those top line growth or if you want to look at it on an AFFO basis then that removes that noise of whether or not it's GAAP reported revenues or cash receipts.
You can just look at the cash.
And generally speaking based on the way revenues are recorded in the industry those cash numbers are going to show slightly higher growth rates than on the GAAP reported numbers.
And that's just a function of those as I gave you the simple example of seeing the continual benefit of the step-ups in escalations over time.
And that'll fall all the way through to the AFFO line.
Research Division</strong> So just to follow up quickly on that Jay these -- sorry -- I get how the straight-lining works.
But it seems like 1/3 of the increase in revenue was from an extension which I would have expected to show up in the straight-lining impact and then 2/3 of it is from amendments which I wouldn't have thought there'd be -- I would have thought there'd be -- roughly 2/3 of the increase in revenue would show up as an increase in cash as well.
So I'm just wondering how the amendment piece is being accounted for whether it just...
Sure.
We do it the same way.
So the way you would think about this when you start to talk about the timing of cash payments the goal of these transactions from the carrier standpoint was to accomplish speed and ease and we shared that goal.
So if you were to think about it in a more normalized sense obviously no carrier is going to go and put all of that equipment up on the first day.
And so what the goal is to match the timing of cash receipts similar to the activity that we would expect over time.
And so that's the way each of these agreements with the carriers have been structured.
And so that's why it's not -- in your simple example there it's not -- that's why it's not 2/3 cash day 1.
Obviously the space has not been utilized day 1 so the agreements are structured to reflect more of the activity and the real activity on the sites rather than structuring them as a prepayment for that.
Yes more closely is when those sites would actually come on the air.
But whether it's embedded in the escalator or actually could be denominated as just a fixed fee on a takedown schedule of sites what results in the commitment -- when it's a commitment then we are required to then go ahead and book the revenue on a straight-line basis.
And so it's really irrelevant whether it's baked into the escalator or just a schedule of fixed payments based upon a takedown schedule commitment on sites.
We've done it both ways by the way depending on the carrier.
And either way we're required to book that revenue upfront.
And then the cash would more likely -- more appropriately track as those sites are designed to come on the air.
Your next question comes from...
Well one more -- you had -- I'm sorry Jonathan you had one more little nib [ph] there on the 2 000 nodes.
Let me -- without reconciling that particular set of 2 000 nodes let me just remind everybody that I think a good thumbnail and that's what it is thumbnail is about 3 nodes to 1 full co-location.
We've said that before to you.
So call it 650 leases if you were to think about it that way.
I'm not again reconciling these 2 000 nodes.
There could be some higher or lower than that.
But generally that's a pretty good rule of thumb.
Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong from Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
Jay you gave some good detail earlier on the implied incrementally the DAS contribution from the services business.
I'm wondering if we can take it down to the AFFO level to just understand the impact of the $25 million increase in guidance for the year how would that split between services versus site rental.
And then Ben you talked about the land aggregators earlier.
Obviously we saw a number of deals for aggregators back at the last year beginning of this year.
I guess the question from my side would be are you still facing the same competition for individual land plots? It would indicate that the aggregators are still there.
They may be smaller but they're still competitive and they're starting to build portfolios again.
Or have we seen them just back off in general as competitors? Jay? Yes Jason on your first question I would tell you typically while not get getting into a greater amount of detail but typically services we would expect that contribution on the income statement to flow through to the AFFO line in about the same period in which it's received.
So if you want to take -- if you're trying to reconcile either by quarter or by year you can basically assume those amounts fall down to the AFFO line.
And we obviously think about it on a more consolidated basis.
So as we're figuring out those numbers we may have haircut here or there some of that impact.
So it may not tie exactly.
But generally speaking that's what I would assume.
Secondly on your PEP -- on the -- we use the term PEP for portfolio extension program.
Sorry for the acronym.
But with respect to the aggregators that are out there they're still in the market and they're still competitive.
And we're losing very very few sites.
We're very aggressive in the market.
When we need to we will win.
That's sort of become our practice.
The way we think about buying land today we have about 60% of our portfolio financed in an off-balance sheet vehicle with landowners.
And so when we looked at buying the property again assuming that we have confidence in the tower which we typically do -- there'll be a few exceptions but generally we like our sites.
When we look at buying our sites we're thinking about refinancing debt because it's otherwise off-balance sheet.
And so that typically is a lower-equity return on an aggregator whose out there to make a private equity-type return.
And so it's not very hard for us to win.
And given our relationships with our landlord and the fact that we've been at this for about 6 years we've got good -- very good relationships with landlords.
They certainly know  to call us and you're seeing that in our results.
And so I'd say we're losing -- it's just a trickle.
I mean every now and then it happens but very rarely.
Your next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore Partners.
Research Division</strong> Two questions if I may.
First in terms of the outperformance in the quarter that $6 million that you attributed to DAS and WCP can you give a little more color on how that broke out between the 2? And then how should we think about the WCP platform going forward? Is this an area that you're going to continue to invest in? That is land leases in general or ground leases in general that might reach beyond your portfolio? And then I guess my second line of questions would be around some of the stuff coming out of Washington D.C.
Two areas.
First we're hearing a lot about potential spectrum sharing.
And I'd be really interesting to hear how you think about spectrum sharing versus the introduction of new spectrum into the marketplace and the potential impact on the towers.
Sure.
On the first question the outperformance I think the main goal -- and you've followed us for long enough to know that we really don't like to get down into the subunits and start reconciling quarter-to-quarter movements.
But I thought it was important in this case because really this is the first quarter in which we operated these acquisitions and I think it more speaks to us just being relatively conservative in terms of how we thought the revenues and adjusted EBITDA were ultimately going to come through on those 2 acquisitions as we underwrote them.
They're more heavily weighted in terms of the benefit that we got.
They're more heavily weighted towards NextG both in terms of the revenue benefit that's flowing  through as well as the synergies.
But I think you now have kind of the baseline for those 2 acquisitions.
And with regards to WCP and the benefit there we acquired a number of rooftops associates with that.
We believe as we've talked about and highlighted as the movements of the carriers moves more and more towards the mobile Internet and providing high-speed data networks in densely populated areas in areas where frankly there are no towers these rooftops become an opportunity.
So we think we may see some opportunities there in the rooftop space.
Most of what we underwrote though frankly was in annuity and looking at the escalators underneath ground leases.
So I think if you were to look at the growth profile that's probably a little bit lower than traditional towers and certainly much lower than what we would expect in the DAS business.
But we do think there is an upside around the rooftop portfolio.
Yes and we've already seen some co-location that results in revenue share for us that wasn't underwritten earlier on.
So that's been early days encouraging.
And then the -- your last question Jonathan around spectrum sharing let me kind of go back over a little history with everybody.
We are a big advocate of anything that basically gets more network and more carriers on the air in the most efficient way.
And our best example of that although it was a trial and hasn't amounted to anything really anything so far because of other issues was Sprint's attempt to network share elements and spectrum with LightSquared.
And we were very supportive of that undertaking.
We came to an agreement that we think was effective for all parties.
It provided additional compensation for us but at the same time provided LightSquared an opportunity that was significantly more attractive than trying to build out on their own.
And we would be a big supporter and advocate of that going forward and we'd do whatever we could to help someone who had spectrum and wanted to share it with an incumbent going forward.
So you might look for more of that in the future and we'd be a big supporter of that.
Research Division</strong> Yes Ben I guess I was thinking about spectrum sharing more of between the government and the commercial entities.
And that's kind of what the FCC has been talking about.
And I guess I have a hard time visualizing how that would happen from an equipment perspective and understanding the potential benefit to the tower operator and I was hoping you might delve into that.
Not into specific detail.
I guess one of the key tenets of the business is that we do restrict our customers to only transmitting spectrum that they own or control.
And so we're not going to put a customer in business to compete with us around these towers that we own.
That said again previous comments and experience we're very accommodating and recognize the efficiency in play when people can share.
And we are an advocate of getting more spectrum on the air and more entrants in the market in the most efficient way possible.
And sharing not only the network but obviously the common elements of the infrastructure like the towers and the ground make perfect sense.
And so where we can do that where -- it's reflective in light loading on the tower and it's literally just spectrum sharing.
We can price it accordingly and we've got a history of doing that.
Your next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
Research Division</strong> Just a couple of follow-up to my T-Mobile questioning which is -- and forgive me if you've said this earlier but have you characterized what the remaining lease term on average was for T-Mobile prior to them signing the extension to 10 years? And then secondly if you could talk a little bit more about the components of revenue growth within the second quarter.
So I think site rental revenue was up something like 13% year-over-year and maybe you could break that down to what was internal growth versus external acquisitions and then maybe throwing in escalators or churn.
Whatever specificity you could give there would be fantastic.
Sure Michael.
On the first question T-Mobile's maturity was about 4 to 5 years previously.
So we extended that from 4 to 5 years to about 10 years.
Now keep in mind when we -- when I say that it's an average of 4 to 5 years.
So what happened with the portfolio is they basically all moved out 10 years from now to a date in the future.
And currently they could have had anywhere from 1 month to 7 to 8 years remaining on the lease.
So it was a mix previously and then moving all of those leases out to a future date.
But on average I think the number is right around 4 to 5 years.
The second part of your question around revenue we grew revenue site rental revenue 13%.
And the components of that about 6% of that would be organic growth.
You could think of that similar to a same-tower sales-type number.
And 7% was coming from the acquisitions that we've done.
The -- as we talked about in the previous quarters we expected churn to be a little bit higher in the first 2 quarters of 2012 than what is typical.
And so the growth in escalations was offset with that churn.
So really there's 2 components that drive the revenue growth.
And typically over the last several years with regards to the organic revenue growth or same-tower sales growth if you want to think about it that way that number has been running in the 4% to 5% range.
So we're running at a level today that's about 20% above the last couple of years roughly just to give you some sort of gauge as to how has the business done.
And the majority of that 6% growth is coming from amendments to existing sites as the carriers deploy the next-generation technologies.
Research Division</strong> And if I could just follow up.
When you think about structuring leasing deals and then the deals with your customers there's obviously a different thing that you want versus like a T-Mobile in this situation.
Do they look at the lease extension as a way of paying you more money over time but limiting their upfront cash costs? Or did you want to insist on that longer duration to give you more visibility into revenue from this customer given just all the different things that could happen in the industry over the next number of years? Yes Mike there's an operational reality there.
I would ask everyone to think about it.
And that is that when the carrier goes in and puts those -- that significant amount of capital in that network they want price certainty.
And so we'll go in.
And typically the conversation goes pretty easily around "Let's go ahead and get price certainty on a brand-new term call it 10 years in this most recent case " which gives them price certainty on how this ultimately is going to happen with the additional equipment.
So the -- I wouldn't really be able to split out for you what's the conversation about the renewal and what's the conversation about the amendment.
They certainly go together.
But they're symbiotic because frankly they want the price certainty for that longer period to amortize their new investment in the network.
Well I think in general as we would look at each of these transactions we would place a very low value on just the pure extension by itself.
I mean we've never set out with the aim of trading away value and run rate to get an extension because we frankly as you -- as we have found we went through the whole renewal cycle with now all of the -- virtually all of the major carriers which makes up 75% of the revenues in the business almost and we went through the first 10 years of the industry came up to those renewal periods and have now extended them.
And the thesis in the business was that these were -- this was critical infrastructure that they need and as Ben said they've made a significant amount of capital investment in.
So we never believed that as we got towards renewal periods that there was really any necessity to trade away value and haven't done so in any of the agreements.
The upside here is really related to whether or not the carriers wanted to make a commitment and be certain about the activity that they were going to put on the sites or not.
And then the rest of the movement in revenues has just been the natural effect of moving from the backside of having more cash than the revenues we were recording to now being on this side of it where the revenues all take a big step and now will grow back into that and over the next several years move back to kind of the midpoint and then on the backside of the contracts.
Research Division</strong> And then one last question if I could.
Just if you look out over the long term I think that you guys have some sale-leaseback deals where at the end of that there was a buyout to the carrier.
What's the totality of that future buyout if you aggregate all the agreements you've done through the years? And how many years off is that when we're thinking in terms of present value implications? I think the only one that -- and I'm not sure entirely what you mean.
If you mean can someone buy out the rent the future rent payments for us typically those do not exist.
We've talked about the only contract that I can think of that might have some runoff of revenues in the future would be around Sprint's iDEN that were -- that would have been the legacy Nextel.
And as we talked about when we did the Sprint agreement we gave them certain flexibility and certain rights to be able to take off the air sites in -- around the range of 2014 and '15.
And we've said that's sort of 2% to 3% of consolidated revenues if they were to go down that path and decommission those sites.
But other than that there's not really buyout-type provisions where folks can walk away from leases that they've committed to.
I'm assuming that's what you're driving at.
Research Division</strong> No.
What I was actually thinking through was -- and I thought it was with Sprint speaking of...? Right.
And I would like...
Yes Mike I think -- yes let me take a quick crack at it.
And it's in the K.
So you can pull up the K if you want.
But it's -- the Sprint portfolio that we acquired through Global Signal as I recall it was a prepaid lease structure which has been used in the industry many times.
And I believe the original term was 32 years.
Today it would be about 6 off of that probably so about 26 years remaining give or take.
And the present value of that buyout Jay do you have a...
It's about $400 million.
Give or take.
It's in the Q.
About 26 years out.
Research Division</strong> Perfect.
Yes that was...
26 years out.
Research Division</strong> Are there -- and so that's what I was curious about.
Are there others that we should be aggregating on top of Sprint? Or is Sprint the only one that we should be aggregating? Well technically BellSouth was the same way.
It was 99 years.
So I guess we're at 89 -- we're at about 89 years left just to be complete.
Your next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.
Research Division</strong> Just a follow-up on the straight line.
I believe you increased the midpoint of the guidance coming from straight-line revenue by $50 million and about $20 million is from T-Mo.
Can you talk about where the remainder is coming from? And maybe just a second question on fiber tower.
I believe you wrote down most of your investment there.
But is there anything that you're carrying on the balance sheet that you need to write down? Sure.
On the second question there's nothing left on our fiber tower investment.
We've written all of that down.
On your first question we increased revenue guidance by about $43 million.
Of that about $20 million of that related to the agreement with T-Mobile that we talked about.
And the balance of it would come from a combination of where we thought the run rate was in the second quarter going into the back half of the year where we thought leasing is in the core business and then the comments that I made earlier around how our acquisition our 2 acquisitions WCP and NextG had performed out of the gate.
And so those run rates were higher than what we had previously underwritten in the acquisition model and then also on a run rate basis coming into the business higher than what we had put into our previous outlook.
Those 2 things combination of about $12 million to $13 million from the acquisition $6 million actually in the second quarter that's about $18 million.
And then the $20 million from the T-Mobile gives you most of the way towards the uplift in revenue and the rest of it would be basically where the run rate was in the base business pre-acquisition.
Research Division</strong> Just to clarify my question was more about the increase in the straight-line revenue.
I think that went up by about $50 million versus your prior guidance.
And about $20 million of that is T-Mo.
I was wondering why you think that a straight-line component would be a bit more -- $30 million more than what you originally expected.
Yes that probably goes to my comments around our conservatism around the timing of cash collections.
We obviously did much better in the second quarter than what we had provided in the outlook going into the second quarter.
And so that's more of a working -- it's almost in essence a working capital measure.
And we've probably been a bit conservative as we think about the back half of the year.
But $20 million of it is -- would relate to T-Mobile and the balance -- we'll just kind of see how the year goes and see where ultimately cash comes out.
Sure.
Let me wrap up.
I thought everybody has been very patient with us while we went through all the questions.
Thanks for your time this morning.
Just to wrap up.
Strategically look it's very important to take a step back and look at where we sit in this industry and with our business in particular.
We're in the middle of an unprecedented wave of build-out as the carriers are all making very profitable investments as you look at their current results the profitable investments to add broadband Internet capacity through 4G services into these networks.
We're able to do that in a very efficient way.
It's something we're very pleased about.
And we're going to work very hard to drive AFFO per share growth into the high teens for the full year this year.
That's not quite guidance but you know we always have stretched goals around here and off of the big base the bigger base every year that we drive.
If we can get into the mid to high teens maybe even get lucky and get 20% one day sort of an outsized goal I have we would be thrilled to death.
So we're very pleased with what we see.
We're working very hard and look forward to visiting with you on the call next quarter.
Thanks very much.
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the conference call for today.
Thanks for participating.
You may now disconnect your lines.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by.

With that I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
As you've seen from our press release and as outlined on Slide 3 we had an excellent third quarter exceeding the high end of our previously issued guidance for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO.
The strong year-to-date results from our site rental business together with better than expected performance from our services business allows us to increase our 2012 outlook for adjusted EBITDA.
In addition to our strong operating results we recently announced an agreement to acquire the rights to lease and operate approximately 7 200 T-Mobile towers in the U.S.
for $2.4 billion with a similar concentration in the top urban locations as our existing tower portfolio reinforcing our position as the largest provider of wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
We expect to close this transaction later this quarter and then we'll talk more about why we're excited about this investment and other recent industry news.
Further on October 15 we closed on a $1.65 billion senior notes offering the proceeds of which together with cash on hand and drawings under our revolving credit facility are expected to be used to fund a portion of the -- to fund the consideration of the T-Mobile tower transaction.
With that let me turn to Slide 4 as I highlight some of the results of our third quarter.
During the third quarter we generated site rental revenue of $539 million up 15% from the third quarter of 2011.
Site rental gross margin defined as site revenues less cost of operations was $403 million up 16% from the third quarter of 2011.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2012 was $400 million up 20% from the third quarter of 2011.
As shown on Slide 5 AFFO was $230 million up 22% from the third quarter of 2011.
And AFFO per share was $0.79 up 20% from the third quarter of 2011.
Moving on to investments and liquidity during the third quarter as shown on Slide 6 we spent $124 million on capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $30 million in our land lease purchase program $8 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $86 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures consisting of $37 million on existing sites and $49 million on the construction of new sites primarily distributed antenna systems deployments or small-cells.
On October 15 we closed on the aforementioned $1.65 billion senior notes offering with an interest rate at 5.25% per annum.
These notes mature in 2023.
Pro forma for the closing of the T-Mobile tower transaction we expect total net debt to annualize adjusted EBITDA to be less than 6.5x.
Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 as shown on Slide 7 and Slide 8 we expect site rental revenue of between $538 million and $543 million and adjusted EBITDA between $398 million and $403 million for the fourth quarter of 2012.
The sequential change to site rental revenue for the fourth quarter is negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of nonrecurring site rental revenue we received in the third quarter that we do not expect to recur in the fourth quarter.
Additionally the assumed Australia exchange rate in the fourth quarter is lower than the actual exchange rate in the third quarter resulting in a negative impact of approximately $1 million in site rental revenue as compared to the third quarter.
We are forecasting services gross margin in the fourth quarter to be lower by approximately $2 million from the third quarter.
Further AFFO in the fourth quarter of 2012 includes $18 million of interest expense associated with the recently closed $1.65 billion financing the proceeds of which we expect to use to fund the T-Mobile tower transaction.
Our revised outlook for 2012 suggests annual site rental revenue growth of 13% and AFFO growth of 16% including the impact of the aforementioned interest expense.
Moving to the outlook on Slide 9.
On an apples-to-apples basis we expect AFFO growth in 2013 to be approximately $120 million essentially the same amount of growth we are forecasting in 2012.
For the full year 2013 we expect site rental revenue of approximately $2.2 billion adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion and AFFO of approximately $885 million.
As noted before we have excluded any benefit from the T-Mobile tower transaction in our outlook both in 2012 and 2013.
However given that we have closed on a portion of the financing for the expected transaction we have included the interest expense of approximately $86 million for the full year 2013 associated with the $1.65 billion senior note.
At a high level our 2013 outlook for AFFO indicates 14% growth in AFFO per share before the expected benefit from the investment of our expected 2013 cash flow and the T-Mobile tower transaction.
Generally we believe the investment of our cash flow can add approximately 400 to 600 basis points to our growth rate in AFFO per share as has been the case for the last several years.
We believe that AFFO per share is the best metric to value our business as it represents our potential dividend capability as we expect to convert to a REIT in the coming years after we have largely consumed our net operating losses.
As you have heard us say for a long time we evaluate the decisions that we make in the business based on the long-term impact to cash flow per share and AFFO is the best proxy for this.
As you can see from the outlook this growth rate in AFFO is meaningfully higher than the growth in site rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
So I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through some of the various assumptions in our 2013 outlook.
The 2013 outlook for site rental revenue growth of approximately $100 million assumes that the majority of the 2013 leasing activity comes from the 4 largest U.S.
carriers as amendment activity related to 4G deployment.
As a result of Crown Castle's previously disclosed agreements with these 4 carriers a significant portion of the revenue benefit of this 2013 amendment activity is already included in the run rate of site rental revenue as of the third quarter of 2012.
With regard to our expectations from small-cells we expect site rental revenue from small-cells to increase approximately 40% in 2013 compared to 2012.
The demand for small-cells continues to exceed our original expectations as we are building systems laying infrastructure and staffing appropriately to meet this demand.
The vast majority of the growth in site rental operating expenses is related to the expansion and deployment of new small-cells systems.
Further we expect year-over-year site rental revenue growth from Australia of approximately 9% as the carriers are beginning to upgrade for 4G and we begin to see the benefit from the deployment of the National Broadband Network.
In addition the 2013 outlook assumes 2% growth from escalators on the existing run rate of revenues offset by tenant terminations of approximately 1% of total site rental revenue which is consistent with historical averages.
With regard to our services business we are expecting the contribution to gross margin to be similar to that of 2012.
As shown on Slide 9 the net result of these assumptions is that we expect site rental revenue for 2013 to increase approximately $100 million and adjusted EBITDA to increase approximately $65 million.
The greatest impact to our incremental margins is our decision to continue to expand and invest in small-cells which we believe will have a terrific long -- we believe will have terrific long-term returns but requires a meaningful investment in operating expenses as we scale the business and deploy new systems.
As such we expect 2013 AFFO to increase by approximately $120 million or 14% compared to 2012 excluding the expected benefit from the T-Mobile tower transaction and the 2013 interest expense associated with the $1.65 billion senior notes raised in advanced of the expected transaction.
Turning to Slide 10.
Our 2013 AFFO benefits from the cash impact of new leasing activity and the significant increases in the contracted cash payments under the previously announced agreements with our customers related to the ongoing 4G deployments.
As we've mentioned over the last several years we have been very successful in working with our customers to extend the terms of our site rental contracts and gain certainty of the benefit from the deployment of 4G across the significant portion of existing leases on our U.S.
tower portfolio.
Over the past 3 years we have been able to renew and extend approximately 2/3 of our customer contracts with initial terms of up to 15 years.
Due to these long-term customer contracts with fixed escalations in the early years of the term we recognized site rental revenues in advance of the contracted cash payments from our customers in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
We have a similar dynamic in site rental expenses as we recognized higher site rental expense than the actual cash rental payment as a result of renewing our ground leases with fixed escalation for long periods of time.
As shown there we have graphed all of our existing leases particularly with regard to our revenue tenant leases for years 2012 through 2020 showing the expected reported amounts of cash receipts.
As shown we would expect that beginning in about 2015 or 2016 our cash receipts from tenant leases will exceed the amount of reported site rental revenues.
For purposes of generating the graph we have assumed that all leases are renewed at their respective term end dates.
As illustrated in the graph based on the aforementioned assumptions we expect that our cash receipts from our existing tenant licenses will grow at approximately 4% per annum for years 2012 to 2020 based on the contracted terms of these licenses.
We have made no assumptions in the graphs with regard to additional tenant leases.
The cash benefit of these lease agreements is reflected in our AFFO outlook which is the primary reason our expected growth in AFFO exceeds our expectation for growth in adjusted EBITDA in 2013.
On Slide 11 with regards to our capital spending in 2013 we expect to invest approximately $350 million on capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites including small-cells.
Our AFFO after expected capital expenditures represents a little over $130 million per quarter of cash flow that we could invest in activities related to our core business including purchases of our shares and acquisitions.
Consistent with our past practice we are focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.
While not included in our 2013 outlook let me quickly run through the expected benefit of the T-Mobile transaction which is outlined on Slide 12.
We estimate that the T-Mobile towers will produce approximately $125 million to $130 million in AFFO before financing costs in 2013.
Further we expect to fund the balance of the consideration beyond what was raised in the 5.25% notes offering for the T-Mobile tower transaction through drawings under our revolving credit facility which has a borrowing cost of LIBOR plus 250 basis points or approximately 3% currently.
As a result we expect the T-Mobile tower transaction net of the related debt financing cost to be accretive to our outlook for AFFO in 2013.
In summary we had an excellent third quarter.
We're very pleased to have been able to access the capital markets at a very attractive rate to fund our T-Mobile tower transaction bringing greater clarity to the accretion we expect from the transaction.
We are excited about the growth we are seeing in small-cells and we expect to deliver mid to high teens’ growth in AFFO per share in 2013.
And with that I’m pleased to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining the call this morning.
It’s a busy time this week with a lot of calls.
As Jay just mentioned we had an excellent third quarter exceeding our outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
And we're excited about our business as we look to the balance of the year.
As you know there is currently a significant amount of activity in our industry as all 4 major U.S.
wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously.
We are enjoying unprecedented visibility into future growth as reflected in our increased 2012 guidance and our initial outlook for 2013.
We continue to make great progress integrating the NextG and WCP assets and are very pleased with the performance and growth of the small cell networks which have exceeded our initial expectations.
In fact organic leasing growth in small-cells is above our business plan and we're excited to be investing in this growth area.
This activity is consistent with our continued -- with the continued adoption by the carriers of small-cells to create a better and more seamless experience by users in areas that are not adequately covered by the traditional macro tower infrastructure.
According to ABI Research both DAS and small-cell equipment sales should reach the $2 billion mark by 2016.
In addition to the continued growth of our site leasing business I'm very pleased that our services business continues to perform very well reflecting the significant level of network upgrade activity in the market.
Service revenues were up 84% and service margins were up 63% compared to the same quarter last year.
This success results from a diligent effort to capture more of the opportunities to assist our customers in locating or upgrading installations on our sites and reflects the doubling of activity we are seeing from all 4 major carriers as they upgrade their networks compared to a year ago.
In addition to our strong organic leasing results you might have heard we recently acquired -- announced the agreement to acquire the rights to the T-Mobile sites to lease and operate approximately 7 200 towers which we expect will close later in the fourth quarter.
We are thrilled with this transaction for a number of reasons.
Most importantly consistent with our disciplined approach to maximizing long-term AFFO per share I believe this transaction will be more accretive to our long-term growth rates and enhancing shareholder value relative to other potential investments such as even buying our own stock.
As Jay mentioned we expect this transaction to be accretive both to our 2013 expected AFFO per share and approximately 5% accretive to our long-term expected AFFO per share.
We expect this transaction to close later in the fourth quarter and are very excited about the significant growth opportunity it provides.
Further these towers are urban-centric complementing our existing portfolio with 83% in the top 100 markets and a significant concentration 72% in the top 50 markets.
As you know the top U.S.
markets are where wireless traffic is heaviest and where carriers traditionally focus their efforts on deploying new technology upgrades to existing technologies such as the current LTE upgrade.
This transaction positions us as the preeminent wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S.
with an unrivaled tower footprint and furthers our strategic objective of being the leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
which we believe is the fastest growing and most profitable wireless market in the world.
In fact the CEO of Softbank echoed this sentiment during the recent press conference on Softbank’s investment in Sprint citing the attractiveness of the U.S.
wireless market due to rising ARPU increasing smartphone and tablet penetration and growth of multiple subscriptions as key reasons for his $20 billion agreement with Sprint.
Similarly T-Mobile's planned merger with Metro PCS further confirms our thesis that the U.S.
wireless market has significant growth potential.
We believe that both the Softbank and T-Mobile investments in the U.S.
wireless market will be very beneficial to our industry.
We are pleased to see the recent Softbank and T-Mobile actions endorsing our view of the U.S.
wireless market.
To that end we are investing in adding resources to take advantage of the market opportunity we see.
Some of this can be seen in our outlook.
We are investing in the operation and installation of more small-cells.
I believe this investment decision will yield significant benefits not unlike when we invested years ago to build our own land lease acquisition capability.
Before I turn the call over for questions I want to spend a minute on the trends that continue to drive the growth in our industry particularly as it pertains to LTE deployments.
Verizon reported on their recent earnings call that the influx of LTE smartphones increased the number of LTE devices on their network to almost 15 million devices from just over 3 million during the same period last year.
Sales of LTE smartphones tablets and modems are ramping quickly with a 44% increase between the second and third quarter of this year.
LTE devices now comprise over 16% of Verizon's postpaid subscriber base.
AT&amp;T further confirmed this trend stating that smartphone penetration had reached 64% of total subscribers.
As the number and adoption of LTE-enabled devices continue we expect that it will provide a further catalyst for mobile data traffic growth.
During the first quarter of 2012 only 5.6% of U.S.
subscribers were on a 4G network and some research suggests or predicts a 16-fold increase in monthly mobile data traffic between 2011 and 2016 fueled by the faster and more robust LTE networks being deployed.
Clearly the mobile Internet is the most pervasive trend driving consumer behavior today and we are well positioned to benefit from this growth in mobile data traffic.
In fact in 2012 this year we have made over $4 billion in acquisitions pro forma for the T-Mobile towers strengthening Crown Castle as the leader in shared wireless infrastructure like towers and small-cells where we believe our solution-based approach will be very attractive to carriers of today and tomorrow.
Today we are the largest wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S.
with an urban-centric portfolio where we expect capital spending activity to be the highest.
We remain focused on the U.S.
market the largest and fastest-growing market in the world where we see the ability of the wireless carriers to make profitable investments is most apparent and barriers to entry remain high.
We are thrilled with the T-Mobile tower transaction which reinforces our industry-leading position and we believe is accretive to both short-term and long-term AFFO per share.
And leveraging our experienced management team customer relationships and service offerings across our unrivaled tower footprint together with our leadership in small-cell networks positions us as the provider of choice as carriers continue to enhance their networks to meet ever-increasing wireless demand.
We can certainly see this occurring today in our results as we are very pleased to be acting as a critical partner in the LTE upgrades being executed by our customers and the growth in small-cell commitments that we are seeing.
We appreciate their confidence and are working very hard to meet their deployment timelines.
So to wrap up as Jay mentioned our initial outlook for AFFO growth for 2013 of $120 million is essentially the same as our expectations for completing 2012 before accounting for the expected benefit of the T-Mobile tower transaction and the prospective investment of our significant and growing free cash flow across the balance of next year.
In other words we see a path of AFFO growth accelerating next year.
So we look forward to finishing the year strong and we are committed to remain committed to delivering mid to high teens’ growth in AFFO per share maybe even 20% as a stretch goal I like to pass around the office if things continue to go our way.
So with that operator we'll be happy to take -- turn the call over for questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Two if I could.
First of all can you talk through a little bit now that you've had I imagine a further chance to look at the assets what's your thoughts on the timeframe for lease up with the T-Mobile towers is and how you think about the long-term run rate? I mean the existing portfolio is about 3 tenants per tower I guess; where you think that can get to over time for the T-Mobile towers.
And secondly when you look at 2013 the available what $530-or-so million in capital have you seen anything changing in the environment that -- regarding deployment of the capital in terms of purchasing assets versus investing your own stock? James I'll take the first one and let Jay take the second one on the deployment of cash.
As we have worked now through and start preparing for closing on the T-Mobile assets our level of enthusiasm has only grown.
We continue to see and expect significant leasing opportunities as we bring those sites in and integrate them and market them and are able to provide the solutions-based approach both on services and the site leasing that those sites represent.
As you know it's a very significant increase in our footprint.
It's about a 33% increase in our footprint with very high concentration in the top 100 markets.
And so based on very preliminary indications from customers we are more enthusiastic I'll just say than we have even at the beginning.
And time will tell but we think we're going to be quite busy with those sites.
So Jay I'll let you take a crack at...
James on the second question around the $530 million that we have to invest our strategy is the same as we've had for a number of years which is we look to invest that cash flow in the opportunities that we think have the best chance to maximize long-term cash flow per share.
And on that list of things that we will look at is everything from buying back our own stock which we've done a significant amount of over the last decade as well as doing things like tower acquisitions and building sites particularly building small-cell sites the small-cells that Ben talked about in his comments and I made some reference to in my comments.
So I don't think there's any change in terms of how we look at investments and allocating that capital and we don't have any pre-conceived plan as to what the allocation among those will be.
We'll look at investments as they come up and allocate them to maximize long-term cash flow per share.
One item I'll note for you to some degree we may use a relatively small portion of that cash flow to reduce the revolver borrowings.
As you know we're a little bit ahead of our targeted level of leverage range about 4x to 6x.
So we have growth in EBITDA that will move us back into the range relatively quickly but we may use some relatively small portion of that cash flow to reduce the revolver balance.
But we’ll have to see how it goes into the course of the year.
But really no change in the strategy.
And our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I wonder if you could just give a bit of color underneath the 2013 guidance.
To what extent have you included any new activity from Clearwire or from DISH in there? Or would that all be incremental to what you disclosed last night? And also we're hearing more about companies that may be exceeding the boundaries of their initial MLAs.
They're needing to put more gear up quicker than expected.
Is that something that's starting to become important? And to what extent do you bake in some of that in as well? Sure Simon.
On the first one it's pretty simple.
There's really not anything included prospectively around Clearwire or around a prospective Dish network launch or sharing opportunity that they may avail themselves of with another carrier.
We'll just have to as we've said on prior calls we're certainly open for business and open for dialogue there and we anticipate that'll be a good outcome but that’s  certainly not in our outlook so far.
And the second...
The second question was around the excess gear that we're seeing some of the...
Yes we are seeing some of that.
We are seeing in various cases and it's not insignificant but hard to forecast where they’re exceeding the original terms of the MLA and taking a second RAD center on the existing site to deal with the capacity challenges they're finding in that particular location.
That's a hard thing to forecast Simon so we wouldn't try to quantify it for you but it's certainly something that we're seeing.
Research Division</strong> And is that a sense that the traffic is just a lot greater than their original plan suggested? Is this happening earlier than you or they expected? Well I'd have to let them speak to the timing but it's generally the configurations ultimately exceeding the capacity on the existing RAD center and/or the height distinction based upon a different frequency that they're requiring.
And so we're seeing occasions where they're taking a second RAD center on site.
And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> Just 2 if I could.
First maybe for Jay just if I'm doing the math correct.
So if I'm looking at AFFO guidance it starts with 14% growth in the $120 million which is coming from the core.
And then if you're talking kind of 125 to 130 for T-Mobile less $109 million of interest costs which are 5.25% on the 1.6 and 3% on the rest that gets you about another $18 million on top of the 120.
And then if you reinvest your existing cash flow you get 4% to 6% growth on top of the base which is another 5% which is another $40 million.
So if I add those up 120 18 40-plus I get something around 21% AFFO growth based on the comments on this call.
I just wanted to kind of make sure I was looking at that correctly and that's all before anything else happens in terms of new demand.
I guess is that fair Jay? Yes you've done it correctly David.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And so that's a -- it sounds like a good news story.
The thing I think the market's struggling a little bit with is trying to square that with the historical perception that the tower business is it's 5% cell site growth and 4% escalators minus 1% churn is 8% revenue growth.
And what it kind of sounds like you're baking into the model here is almost no new cell site growth at all some escalators some churn and you're netting out to a much smaller revenue number than people are used to seeing.
And I guess the question really is is what you're telling us about the demand profile is this a sea change in the evolution of the industry? Is this a conservatism? Is this something that's getting lost in the translation from GAAP accounting to cash accounting? Why doesn't this look like what we're used to seeing in terms of growth from this company? Sure.
That's a great segue to go back to kind of what I was trying to step through in my prepared comments around the differences between the growth in adjusted EBITDA versus as you've correctly laid out the growth in AFFO.
So we're expecting AFFO growth on a normalized or an apples-to-apples basis of about $120 million.
And if you go back up the income statement and look at adjusted EBITDA about $65 million of adjusted EBITDA growth.
And the difference there is the function of really 2 things: First of all as you've highlighted there are some differences in terms of the cash revenues that we're collecting and our GAAP revenues.
So over the last several years as we've announced we've done a number of agreements with carriers who are now deploying 4G activities.
And those agreements gave them certain rights to add additional equipment to our towers based on the contracted cash payments that they made with us.
So under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles we have to go in and go ahead and book that revenue because it's certain on the day at which we make the agreement with the customer and then we receive the cash over time.
And so what's happening in our numbers now is you're seeing the significant uplift in the steps of cash payments from these customers associated with that activity.
Now in the past we didn't have certainty of the activity.
So as we would go into any given year and we added tenants to the towers that would represent both new revenue and new cash.
And in this case because we have certainty of the activity the revenue is already included in the run rate as we leave 2012.
And then over the course of the year we get the contractual steps and cash payments from those leases.
And so during the period of time all that to say during the period of time under which we’re -- the carriers are deploying the 4G equipment as permitted under their agreements with us we don't expect to see a real large meaningful impact to site rental revenues but we do expect to continue to get the benefit of the contractual cash steps in those payments.
So that's the first reason.
The second reason is the comments that I made around our small-cells business.
And we are making an investment as you can see in the cost increase in 2013 from 2012.
We're making an investment in operating costs.
And those operating costs are driving 2 things: One is giving us operational scale in the business so that we can continue to operate these systems and the second one is deploying new systems.
And the combination of those 2 creates incremental margins that are lower than what we've seen in the past and that's all being driven by this investment of additional operating cost in the small-cell business.
So that's really the reason why you've got this separation which as you correctly pointed out is different than what we've seen in the past.
But at the same time it's I think one of the reasons why we've tried over the last several years to focus our conversation on cash flow per share.
And this is long-term the best as we believe the best indication of what our capability is to issue a dividend over the long period of time.
So that AFFO per share number reflects all of the changes in how we structure the customer agreements and we're seeing the benefit of big steps in cash.
I would just add one other thing to that.
For example this -- the activity we've seen in the last quarter in this third quarter about 70% of the activity that we saw going on the towers was actually presold.
So it's important to remember that these contracts that we did we're effectively preselling the 4G upgrade activity across a significant base of our customer base.
And so we're now collecting the cash for that and those are contracted cash payments over the term of that as licenses as Jay mentioned and we've talked about before 9 years of term.
And the graph says from 2012 2020 that contracted escalator of about 4% across the entire book of business.
And so that is sort of all-inclusive number.
And so you see the cash going up but the run rate to a large degree related specifically to the 4G upgrades are already presold.
However you do make a point which we certainly expect to see over time.
It's just hard to see at the moment.
And that is increasing levels of leasing and sales beyond what's already contracted.
And that would be from cell splitting; that would be from the second RAD center we talked about a minute ago people taking more than is permitted under the current MLAs; the growth in the small-cell business all those things we think become more meaningful as we go through these LTE upgrades.
And that is incremental revenue and obviously cash flow over time but certainly not contemplated in the current agreements that are making up the majority of our current revenue stream.
And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Research Division</strong> This is Marc Albanese on for Jonathan.
I just wonder what network services.
When thinking about 2013 should I really be focusing on your run rate in the third quarter or more of a blended average on 2012? And also when you do look to convert to REIT are these going to be part of a TRS or QRS? Yes the first question with a big groan from all the Crown Castle people working on this I'd say we're focused on sort of the current run rate.
And we are seeing a tremendous amount of activity; we've got a lot of people working very hard to deliver that.
But that's basically our focus is sort of the second half of the year run rate.
Marc your second question.
I would say we're still in the early days of preparing for a REIT reconversion.
Obviously we don't expect to exhaust our net operating losses until 2015 -- towards the end of 2015 or early 2016 so we're in the early days of beginning this work.
However I would tell you from our initial look at it the vast majority of the services work that we perform would qualify as REIT income.
And so we would expect at least at this point I would expect that our services business will not be in a separate taxable REIT subsidiary.
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I want to follow up on some of David's comments maybe give you a couple of quick questions on the guidance front.
First when the T-Mobile deal closes will you consider updating guidance at the closing or do we expect that that should come on the next quarterly call? I believe we'll update it when we get to January at the end of January when we report our fourth quarter results.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Second question you've talked a lot about the spending on the -- investing in the small-cell side.
Is that both -- am I interpreting it correctly that's both OpEx and CapEx? And if so what line item in the OpEx area will that affect? Yes it is some of both.
And Rick I think as I articulated the spending there on small-cells I think on the capital side we will continue over time to make investments in these to build additional systems.
We believe that on the operating expense side which is going to hit site rental direct operating cost so as you look at the numbers that would impact site rental gross margin for 2013.
We believe that is a bit of a onetime step-up as we build scale into the -- operating scale into the business.
But that is affecting our direct site rental gross margins.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then on your CapEx budget that you gave towards the end of the presentation.
Can you break that down into the different categories of land and augmentation and small-cells? Sure.
On the -- on land side we'll spend in the neighborhood of about $100 million on land.
We'll spend about $100 million on -- $100 million to $150 million on distributed antenna systems or small-cell activity.
And then we'll spend most of the rest of the balance of that on upgrading existing sites for new tenants.
And then there will be some small portion of that CapEx that will be spent on building new towers.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then probably the more interesting question T-Mobile when they made the announcement of buying Metro PCS has mentioned that they want to keep the DAS network or DAS networks that Metro had built for them.
And I think several of those were done by NextG.
T-Mobile mentioned that they need to add not just -- would have the CDMA network but they need to add the GSM HSPA Plus LTE.
Is that in your guidance yet? And what are your thoughts about that co-location opportunity on those DAS networks? We've been a little gentle in our DAS guidance Rick.
We are tracking ahead of our original acquisition model on the NextG acquisition.
But as you rightly point out those amendments that would come across an existing base would be additional revenue opportunities and we look at it really as a total pot of new revenues.
So we go through it at line by line granular level and look at okay here's amendment opportunities here's additional co-location opportunities and then here's brand-new system opportunities to which we are in fact engaged by Metro PCS today on some systems which we're very pleased with.
So we really build it from the ground up and so we're not always sure as -- we've been in this business a long time.
It's not a perfect science.
We get it about 60% to 70% right in terms of predicting exactly what the components of revenue are because obviously we can't completely predict customer behavior and timing.
But I'd say all those factors are considered as we go into what our lease-up expectation or revenue growth on small-cells is.
But taken in aggregate we are certainly tracking above what we originally planned.
And I think there's probably a little upside left but we'll have to see how that goes.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> But explicitly the T-Mobile Metro one was probably not part of your process.
No not really.
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Maybe just one quick follow-up on the revenue growth question just because obviously it's important.
You gave a lot of helpful qualitative comments but I think you've also given people a way to quantify all this.
So when you talk about 1% revenue growth in existing tenant leases and if you sort of step back your guidance actually implies 4.7% total site rental revenue growth.
But then if you remove the non-cash portion of this to the changes year-over-year you're actually implying just above 7% cash revenue growth in 2013.
So A is that the way you guys see it? And then B if so how does that compare to what was implied in sort of the forward guide in previous years? Because it seems like it's probably not all that different.
And then second quick question is just on churn.
Last year you sort of called out potential for lumpy Alltel-related churn.
Are there any other big churn pools that you would call out that's included in the 2013 guide? Sure.
On the first question Jason I think you've described it correctly.
There's about 5% revenue growth; 1% of that is coming from the base of business.
It's 2% growth in escalators less about 1% of churn.
And then the balance of it is coming from leasing-related activity on the portfolio.
In the past over the last couple of years on an organic basis if you will or a same-tower sales basis we've been growing revenues about 8% 8% to 9% in total about 1% to 2% out of the base and then 6% to 7% out of organic leasing.
So our leasing assumption is down but to your point if you were to adjust it and consider that we presold a significant amount of the opportunity in 2013 we're looking at something that's relatively comparable to past years making that adjustment.
And obviously as we look forward over the long-term as Ben mentioned we think there's opportunities for that number to go back up as the activity moves from just simply being amendment activity on related leases to going back in being infill sites or adding additional RAD centers to towers that they're already located on.
On your second question around churn there's no significant items or meaningful items that I -- individual customers that I would single out for 2013 in terms of churn.
1% churn is in line with our historical levels of churn and so it looks like a normal year.
I would mention that on the horizon although not in 2013 is obviously the changes that Sprint had looked at with regard to their iDEN network.
iDEN makes up about 3% of our consolidated revenues.
And we would expect to the extent that they ultimately do decommission and don't redeploy those sites for CDMA or LTE that we would see the churn of that revenue beginning at the beginning of 2014 and then see that 3% come off over the calendar year '14 and then the first half of 2015.
So I don't have great clarity obviously at this point as to the exact timing of that but if you were to assume 3% over those 6 quarters that's at least the bookend of where we think this thing plays out if ultimately they decommission that.
But in the short-term I don't have any visibility towards any specific events in calendar year '13.
Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> I just want to clarify.
On the 2% escalator that's obviously lower than what we've historically seen.
It's been more like 3.5%.
Is that a function of the way the revenue is being straight-lined under the MLA? It is Brett.
So on a cash basis the cash is growing about 4% and the benefit we're receiving on -- in GAAP revenues is about 2%.
So that is exactly the impact of the straight-line.
Research Division</strong> And then speaking of master lease agreements maybe I'm wrong here but I think that the way the Sprint agreement works is that you don't necessarily have the presold capacity like you do with some other carriers.
It was more a pricing structure where as a complete activity you know in advance what you will get paid for it.
So is that correct? Yes it's priced as a unit basis as a price for a certain configuration on the site as you identified Brett but it is a commitment on their part.
So it's in the run rate okay? So again these rules -- we didn't make up the GAAP rules.
But if it's a commitment then it's straight-line revenue.
And so it was based on a particular configuration on each individual site and a payment per site based on just as they would naturally have deployed but it was structured as a commitment such that we had to record the revenue when the commitment was made.
And so that's effectively going through the numbers today.
But again the cash you'll now see the cash go consistent with their commitment plan in terms of how they're phasing their LTE upgrade -- or network modernization plan and that's in fact a contributor to what we're seeing in AFFO.
Brett one thing that may be just helpful is for us to just step back for a second and talk about the 4 big carriers at a high level in terms of what we've presold versus what we haven't.
Because what's difficult for us as we've talked about over time is we've tried to get some clarity to what we've presold and what we haven't presold and how those contracts work in terms of our cash commitments.
But each of those agreements are unique.
And they're unique based on what the carriers believe their deployment schedule looks like.
And so we've tried to be careful in terms of our description of these agreements to not give away what a particular carrier an individual carrier is expecting to do or how many sites that they're going to do.
So as we look at the big 4 carriers and the activity that's going on in the U.S.
today for the deployment of 4G there is some of that activity and we would say the vast majority of that activity that's going on today that is presold.
And that's a mix of things where carriers had rights to make -- add equipment to existing levels and add existing levels on the towers.
Then other situations there is specific equipment that they can add to towers at a specific -- at the level that they're on currently.
So there's a mix of how each of these agreements are structured.
And the comments that we're trying to make in terms of giving you color around the 2013 outlook is to tell you that what we're seeing in terms of the activity and what we expect in 2013 is that the vast majority of that activity is actually included already included in the run rate of site rental revenues.
Now as we move out the timeline to the right and as the carriers and we're seeing early signs of this as the carriers look to add additional capacity to their 4G networks there's a significant amount of that activity that's not presold.
And so our assumption in the outlook for 2013 is that most of the activity is presold but as we're seeing early signs of we may get into the calendar year and find out that the phasing or deployment schedules of that activity may become sooner than what we had expected in our outlook.
So it's -- when we start to ask about specific carriers we want to be careful about how we answer the question at the same time trying to tie that back to the outlook that we gave.
The outlook assumes that the vast majority of the activity is in the current run rate.
Research Division</strong> I appreciate that.
The reason I brought Sprint is just because on their call this morning they noted that Network Vision is maybe about a quarter behind schedule.
And I was just trying to understand if there is any meaningful sensitivity to your guidance based on a quarter's of activity at Sprint.
Not at this point.
No because again it's a committed payment structure so it's already in the revenue.
One other point we didn't mention because frankly it's a little bit trivial.
It's not trivial to us but it may be trivial to you because you can't really see it in the revenue is our outlook internally for leasing is up about 10% over 2012.
But you can't see much of that in the number because so much of what we already see is already presold.
So the amount then the -- new activity new leasing activity x what's already been sold is actually up year-over-year.
The reason we didn't really make a big deal of it is because you guys can't see it and we appreciate that.
We understand that.
But it's ultimately cash and it's activity.
And our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.
Research Division</strong> One more follow-up on the '13 guidance if I could.
So you mentioned in the third quarter that 70% of the activity was presold.
So when we look at this 2013 guidance should we assume a similar 70% presold or is that number higher? And...
It's about that level yes Batya.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just a couple of quick follow-ups.
In -- for the guidance straight-line revenue impact for 2012 I think you've lowered it a bit.
Can you talk about why that reduction came in and if you could remind us how much of the straight-line impact T-Mo MLA added in the second half? And finally just one question on the T-Mo towers.
Can you quantify the exposure they have to iDEN and what contract life they have? Okay.
On the first question as I said but I was kind of speaking over you apologies for that approximately 70% of the activity in 2012 was related to -- was presold.
And in 2013 it's a similar level about 3/4 of the amendment activity is really presold.
With regards to the guidance and we talked about this a little bit last quarter we did -- we do expect cash in this calendar year to be slightly ahead of what we had previously guided.
And I think as we get our sea legs under us and focus on cash we'll probably continue to maybe be a tad conservative in terms of forecasting exactly where cash is in any given quarter.
There's a few things that move around obviously related to that to the billings and receipts of cash.
And so I'll just let the guidance that we gave stand.
With regards to iDEN on the T-Mobile site it represents about 3% of the revenues 3% of the revenues there.
Research Division</strong> And what's the average life of the contract? The average life of the contract's about 2.5 years maybe a little less than 2.5 years.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And the straight-line impact that you included from T-Mo in the second half is that $20 million? We didn't give a specific number on that but it would be in the ballpark of about $20 million.
Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
Ben you're now the Chairman of PCIA and in Orlando you mentioned you would be getting more involved in the process for the public safety network.
Can you give us a few key events or milestones that you think we can look forward to to get a sense if this is going to become reality over the next year or 2 for Crown in terms of a revenue driver? Kevin thanks for that.
We are really excited about the progress that the FirstNet board has -- is already making.
And this is going to be a -- it is going to be long-term and it's certainly not in our current outlook.
But the recognition that as mandated by Congress that they to the fullest extent possible locate on shared infrastructure i.e.
existing towers co-location we think is absolutely the right way to go.
There's a lot of different potential architectures floating around about how this will actually get launched whether it will be as part of a shared network with existing commercial carriers today where they would contribute their spectrum and then be hosted effectively on those networks; or whether it will be a separate network built across co-location on towers.
I think it's too early to predict that outcome but we're very pleased that they actually -- there's 20 megahertz allocated upwards of $7 billion depending upon how the auctions go and obviously a very concerted effort on their part to get moving on a National Public Safety Network.
Given our position with pro forma 30 000 sites most of which in the top 100 cities you can bet we as Crown Castle will be very interested and engaged in that process of facilitating their deployment regardless of how they ultimately decide the architecture goes.
Whether it's a shared deployment with existing commercial networks we can certainly participate in that as we talked about before or whether it's a discrete new build we obviously know how to price configurations on towers and have the capability to get them installed very rapidly.
So it's very early days but there is progress being made and we're encouraged and engaged honestly engaged in the process and in the conversation and stay tuned.
We think it's a maybe a '14 or '15 event.
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> A lot's been asked and I apologize if this is out there yet but Ben can you talk about your service revenue a little bit? A big number this quarter.
It's been ramping pretty nicely and I know you typically guide fairly conservatively for it but as you look at what you're doing for carriers and you look at the pace of their sort of updates of amending their networks how do you see this trending not only in the fourth quarter? Does that look conservative or was there something in 3Q that was sort of a onetime? And then in '13 is there a point at which you see this sort of naturally flowing off unless something changes? Yes what we basically have implied in the guidance is essentially the second half run rate of this year into ‘14 -- 2013.
But Phil I appreciate the question because the crew doesn’t get a lot of credit sometimes.
We are -- we've seen twice the application volume on our sites in the third quarter as we saw in the third quarter of '11.
So 2x the actual volume going through the door in terms of processing applications and then an increasing level of those sites where we're actually handling the service the installation work largely related to the LTE upgrade.
And at the same time we've increased the scope of services to include site acq and zoning work in many cases.
So we're typically handling more of the individual transaction and booking more revenue and margin accordingly.
So it's been a great outcome for us.
It gives us not only a revenue opportunity but it keeps us close to customers; it keeps us more in control of the deployment and helping them meet their deployment timelines and obviously helps us control what's going on our assets.
Because we do a lot of our own structural analyses in-house we can -- we just -- you're closer to the asset which we think is the right thing to do.
Financially it's very difficult to predict how it continues to grow.
Obviously we're going through a timeline right now where there's a huge bubble of activity around all 4 carriers doing LTE amendment.
In fact we're adding people in the company to support that work.
We didn't really mention it on this call because it's being covered by margin as you would hope it is which it is so you really won't be able to see.
But in addition to adding resource and investment in the small-cell business we're doing the same to support the service level of activity but again it's self-funding covered by the margin.
Undoubtedly you can look forward and say at some point in the future you're going to see that start to tail off obviously mitigated by the additional 7 300 sites we're bringing in on T-Mobile so we expect to have service opportunity there as well which might mitigate that step down.
But certainly when you see the level of activity in '12 I don't think you can just forecast that out forever.
But at the same time we're carrying costs there that we think are variable costs in many respects.
And so you'd see the cost load come down as well.
I think we'll take one more question since we're a little over our time.
Appreciate everybody's patience.
Our final question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
Research Division</strong> I guess a big question is when -- how much capacity does the amendment activity give us and when does that run out? Do you think '14 we'll start to see the cell site splitting? '15 do they have enough capacity to get through '13 herein? And I guess related to that when do you think we start to see the shutdown of the 2G and 3G networks? What year does that really start to impact things? Yes that's a tough one for us from our chair to address.
I'd probably defer that to our customers.
But in terms of as we see the deployment of LTE we certainly see that continuing full-on '13 and '14.
I mean we've looked at it carrier-by-carrier and we see a lot of activity full year '14.
So I don't think that's closed down.
The real question is when do you start to see the cells splitting and that incremental revenue coming.
As we mentioned a minute ago we're actually already seeing that.
And we're seeing that to the extent of a marginal amount of incremental leasing on our sites in terms of new co-locations both in new sites and second RAD centers on existing sites.
So we're already seeing that to a point again not really that material in the run rate yet but we're encouraged by what we see and I would expect you'll see that continuing gradually over time as we move out into second half of '13 and into '14.
But right now appreciate that everybody's pretty much every waking moment is being worked on is consumed by LTE activity.
Never have we seen 4 carriers each trying to overlay an LTE upgrade as we're seeing now with T-Mobile just getting started.
And so the industry is very busy if you talk around – you can just talk to vendors and people that you might know in the market.
There's a lot going on and we're very pleased to be participating in that at the service level and obviously ahead of plan in many respects in terms of the presold revenue.
But we'll get to a point where that has kind of run its course and as we talk about public safety and potentially the DISH Network spectrum coming into the market and additional co-location from cell splitting and things there's plenty of upside long-term to what I would call organic revenue growth.
And in the meantime obviously cash pays the dividend one day and cash flow growth around here we continue to think is sort of mid-teens as I mentioned sort of stretched to 20% and we're going to work pretty hard to get that done.
Research Division</strong> I think it's been -- do the carriers think the amendments give them enough capacity for the next 2 years or they're not really sure at this point? It certainly gives them more capacity.
That's just a technology fact.
However nobody has ever been in this environment where we continue to use more data than people can ultimately produce.
You see tablets.
I mean literally every single morning on CNBC there's a new company talking about their mobile strategy.
And so that takes bandwidth; that takes sites.
And so it's a -- we're in uncharted territory about how fast the data growth occurs and how fast that capacity gets consumed.
Obviously we're going to work very hard to keep up and we are thrilled with the position of the company which has been very deliberate.
I'll again say this year is I think going to turn out to be a watershed year for Crown Castle and how we have positioned the company for the next 10 years in terms of assets.
But we are working very hard to keep up and we got a lot on our plate.
I would like to end the call.
I appreciate everybody hanging with us a little longer than the hour.
There's a lot going on in the industry.
I know there's another call today or 2 so thanks again and we'll talk to you on the fourth quarter call.
Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for standing by.

Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
We had an excellent 2012.
In addition to delivering very strong results we achieved several significant accomplishments during the year as shown on Slide 3.
We've completed $4 billion of acquisitions including the T-Mobile tower transaction which increased our tower count to over 30 000; the acquisition of NextG Networks the leading provider of distributed antenna systems; and the acquisition of 2 300 ground lease related assets from Wireless Capital Partners.
These transactions position us as the largest infrastructure provider in the U.S.
with approximately 22 000 towers in the top 100 markets and extensive small-cell operations in over 50 markets with a concentration in the top urban locations where leasing activity is the highest.
Further these transactions reinforce our strategic objective of being the leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
which we believe is the fastest-growing and most profitable wireless market in the world.
We believe that these transactions will be accretive to our long-term growth rates and enhancing the shareholder value.
Additionally during the year we completed more than $7 billion in financing activities to refinance existing debt and fund the aforementioned acquisition.
These financings lowered our average cost of debt by 170 basis points to 4.5% and extended the average maturity to approximately 7 years.
Further in March 2012 we were pleased to be added to the S&amp;P 500 Index.
In addition to these meaningful events we consistently delivered strong results above our original expectations.
For the full year we grew site rental revenue by 15% adjusted EBITDA by 19% and adjusted funds from operations by 20% compared to 2011.
These results were considerably above our expectations at the beginning of 2012.
Further our services business continued to outperform our expectations delivering strong growth in 2012 as we continue to work very hard to meet customer deployment objectives and facilitate customers' installations on our sites.
Similar to the results for the full year 2012 we achieved strong growth in the fourth quarter results as shown on Slide 4.
During the fourth quarter we generated site rental revenue of $570 million up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2011.
This 21% growth was comprised of approximately 6% from new tenant addition reflecting the increased leasing activity driven by the 4 major carriers upgrading their networks; 12% from acquisitions including NextG and 1 month of site rental revenue from the T-Mobile towers that closed on November 30; and approximately 2% from our existing base of business from contracted renewals and contracted escalators net of churn.
Further we had approximately $5 million of non-recurring items in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to about $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues less cost of operations was $421 million up 20% from the fourth quarter of 2011.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $414 million up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2011.
AFFO was $243 million up 26% from the fourth quarter of 2011 as shown on Slide 5.
And importantly AFFO per share was $0.83 up 22% from the fourth quarter of 2011.
Turning to Slide 6 pro forma for the T-Mobile tower transaction and refinancing.
We ended 2012 with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 6.3x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of approximately 3.4x.
Our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and cash interest expense coverage ratio are comfortably within their respective debt covenant requirements.
Further we completed a number of meaningful financings during the fourth quarter.
We closed on a $1.65 billion senior notes offering at the holding company with an interest rate of 5.25% per annum the proceeds of which together with cash on hand and drawings under our revolving credit facility were used to pay for the T-Mobile tower transaction.
These notes mature in 2023.
In December we closed on a $1.5 billion senior secured notes offering at one of our subsidiaries.
This was comprised of $1 billion of senior secured notes due in 2023 and $500 million of senior secured notes due in 2017 with a blended interest rate of 3.4%.
The proceeds of these notes together with a portion of the revolver were used to tender and redeem in full $830 million of 9% notes and $965 million of 7.75% notes saving $85 million of cash interest expense per year.
Also in December 2012 we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion of which $1.3 billion is currently drawn.
During the fourth quarter as illustrated on Slide 7 we invested $158 million on capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $47 million on our land lease purchase program which continues to perform very well as we work to extend the ground lease maturity and ground ownership of the land beneath our towers.
In total during 2012 we extended over 1 000 land leases and purchased land beneath more than 400 of our towers.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 75% of our gross margin.
In fact 36% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on the land that we own.
Further the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years.
Having completed over 13 000 land transactions we believe this activity has resulted in the most secure land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease expiration.
Our team is doing a great job on this important endeavor as we remain focused on achieving the long-term benefits of protecting our margins and controlling our largest operating expense.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we spent $18 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $93 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures.
the latter consisting of $51 million on existing sites and $41 million on the construction of new sites primarily small-cell construction activities.
Sustaining capital expenditures in the fourth quarter was higher than the third quarter by approximately $10 million primarily due to an IT upgrade that we did throughout the company and some structural-related activities that are typically higher in the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2012 as shown on Slide 8 and 9 of the presentation site rental revenues were approximately $2.1 billion up 15% from 2011.
This 15% growth was comprised of the following: approximately 6% from tenant equipment added to our sites reflecting the strong leasing activity we enjoyed in 2012; 7% from acquisitions; and approximately 2% from contracted escalators and renewal of tenant leases net of churn on our existing base of business that was in place at the beginning of 2012.
Site rental gross margin grew 16% from 2011 to $1.6 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA for 2012 was $1.6 billion up 19% from 2011.
And AFFO per share increased 18% from 2011 to $3.04 for the full year 2012.
Moving to the 2013 outlook our expectations for growth in our base business remain unchanged from the 2013 outlook we provided last October.
We have updated our 2013 expectations for the T-Mobile tower transaction and the refinancing activities that I previously mentioned.
For the first quarter 2013 as shown on Slide 10 we expect site rental revenue of between $605 million and $610 million and AFFO of between $259 million and $264 million for the first quarter 2013.
The sequential growth in site rental revenue from Q4 2012 to Q1 2013 includes the benefit of approximately 41 -- $44 million of additional site rental revenue from the T-Mobile towers offset by approximately $5 million in non-recurring items that positively impacted the fourth quarter of 2012.
Turning to Slide 11 our full year 2013 outlook has been revised to reflect the expected impact from the T-Mobile tower transaction together with the impact of recent financings we completed in the fourth quarter of 2012.
We expect site rental revenue growth in 2013 of approximately $330 million or 16% over 2012.
Of this amount we expect approximately $270 million to come from acquisitions.
The balance of the year-over-year growth reflects our expectation of leasing activity to be similar to historical levels with a significant portion of this activity already reflected in the run rate of site rental revenue as a result of our previously disclosed agreements with the 4 major carriers relating to 4G/LTE amendment activity.
With regard to services we are expecting approximately the same contribution to gross margin as we achieved in 2012.
We expect 2013 AFFO per share to increase by approximately 21% to $3.68 per share.
As shown on Slide 12 during 2013 we expect to generate over $1 billion of AFFO and invest approximately $400 million to $450 million on capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites including small cells.
In summary we are experiencing tremendous growth in our business.
In fact the compounded annual growth rate of AFFO per share from 2010 through our expectations for 2013 is in excess of 18%.
Importantly we have been able to produce this growth while positioning ourselves for future growth without increasing the risk profile of our site rental revenues.
We believe our results reflect the value of the disciplined investments we've made over a long period of time through share purchases and U.S.
acquisitions and the industry-leading customer service we provide.
We had a terrific 2012 with a number of significant accomplishments.
And I'm very excited about 2013 as we continue to execute around our core business and integrate these important acquisitions.
With that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
I want to take a couple of minutes and reflect on the tremendous year we had on a number of fronts.
As Jay just mentioned we delivered excellent financial results for 2012 and we acted intentionally to significantly enhance our portfolio through key acquisitions that should increase our growth prospects for years to come.
Today with over 30 000 towers and over 10 000 small-cell nodes in the U.S.
and a presence in 98 of the top 100 markets we are the leading provider of shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
facilitating wireless carrier mobile broadband deployment.
In addition to a strong year of site leasing our U.S.
services business performed exceptionally well as we continue to capture more of the revenue opportunities associated with assisting our customers in locating or upgrading installations on our sites.
This increase in services activity reflects the unprecedented activity we are seeing from all 4 major carriers as they upgrade to LTE and it is attributable to the confidence our customers have shown in Crown Castle as regularly expressed in our customer surveys that consistently rank us as delivering the highest customer service in the industry.
During 2012 we invested $4 billion in acquisitions -- quite a year -- bolstering our premier portfolio of wireless infrastructure assets in the U.S.
with 7 100 additional towers to the T-Mobile tower transaction.
And following the NextG Networks acquisition we are now the largest independent small-cell operator in the U.S.
Small cells are increasingly important as the rapid growth in mobile traffic and data demands shifts to low-mobility locations requiring wireless operators to bridge the gap between capacity and demand.
Both the T-Mobile and the NextG portfolios are urban-centric complimenting the location of our existing portfolio in the top 100 markets which is where the wireless traffic is heaviest and where carriers traditionally focus their efforts on deploying new technologies and upgrades to existing technologies such as the current LTE upgrade.
Finally we expect that our acquisition of ground lease related assets from WCP which relate predominately to third-party towers will allow us to apply the expertise we have gained as the industry leader in land lease extensions and purchases.
Integration of the T-Mobile towers is underway and proceeding well and I would like to extend my appreciation to the staff at Crown Castle and T-Mobile who are assisting us with an orderly transition on those sites.
As evidenced by our recent domestic acquisitions we remain firmly convinced that the U.S.
market the largest and fastest-growing wireless market in the world has significant growth potential with increasing smartphone and tablet penetration growth of multiple subscriptions and where the ability of wireless carriers to make profitable investment is most apparent and the barriers to entry remain high.
As I look out into 2013 and beyond I'm as excited about the prospects for our business as any time in memory based on our ability to deliver the compelling economics of shared wireless infrastructure across this expanded platform.
This is an unprecedented time in our industry with all 4 major carriers actively upgrading their 4G networks which is driving significant revenue growth on our sites.
Further the expanding LTE networks are expected to accelerate the growth of computing devices including smartphone and tablets over the next several years and it is the wealth of such devices that is the major driver for mobile data traffic growth and wireless data revenue.
According to CTIA's semiannual survey the consumption of data continues unabated as Americans consumed more than 1.1 trillion megabytes of data from June 2011 to June 2012 which is more than double the previous year according to CTIA.
The survey also revealed that smartphone adoption continues to grow impressively.
As of June 2012 smartphones made up 131 million or 41% of the embedded wireless connections and up 37% from a year ago.
And the number of wireless-enabled tablets laptops and modems was up 42% year-over-year.
Further mobile Internet usage is already beginning to displace PC usage and the U.S.
is leading this trend.
It is expected that by 2015 there will be more consumers accessing the Internet through mobile devices than through PCs.
These figures illustrate Americans' growing appetite for more mobile data and the utility that it provides.
And we provide the essential shared infrastructure and services that assist our company -- our customers in meeting these challenges and facilitate the execution of their network deployment plans.
To that end I believe the growth we are currently experiencing is an early indicator of the important and increasing role our assets and capabilities will play in enabling wireless carriers to meet the mobile broadband demand of consumers.
So to wrap up and go to questions we are delighted with the 2012 results and the 2013 outlook of 21% AFFO per share growth.
And I believe they demonstrate the quality of our assets and our ability to execute for customers.
To that end I want to take this opportunity to thank all the men and women of Crown Castle who have worked very hard to make our goals a reality.
With that operator I'd like to turn the call over for questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just some -- a question here on the guidance.
If I look at the fourth quarter your SG&amp;A kicked up a notch.
I was hoping you can give us a little color on that.
And then what's the level of SG&amp;A you're anticipating in your guidance for 2013? Yes.
So Brett there's a -- you're right and some of the numbers Fiona can walk you through.
But generally year-over-year and most of all of it is in the fourth quarter run rate.
We'll see about a $20 million increase not only in G&amp;A.
It's evenly split between G&amp;A and above-the-line tower costs to goods sold and basically indirects which represents the staff and resources we are adding to really handle the LTE activity we're seeing the services level activity we're seeing.
We've added resources in the DAS small-cell business as you can -- as we have mentioned before.
And then with -- and then some modest increase from the T-Mobile acquisition.
So the run rate is largely already stepped as we sit here in January of 2013.
But on a year-over-year basis it looks to me about -- right about $20 million total.
And that's about evenly split.
Again about $10 million on G&amp;A and about $10 million above the line.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And so if your run rate in G&amp;A is going to kind of persist in say the first quarter that would imply that you also expect an above-run-rate contribution from your services business earlier in the year even though on an annual basis it's probably going to be flat.
Is that the right interpretation? That's right.
That's right yes.
Research Division</strong> And then just to get back to the comment that Jay made earlier he was talking about how -- because of the -- essentially the master lease agreements you have so much of your revenue is kind of baked into the run rate.
So I'm just curious like how sensitive is your guidance this year to the actual level of leasing activity going on in the market in light of those master lease agreements? Let me frame that for you a little bit.
When you think about new leasing activity as we all work on every day around here the financial or GAAP revenue reality is about half of that activity is pre-sold and about half of that is new revenue in the year.
Okay? So roughly evenly split.
And let me give you a little window into what we see.
Among the half that is not pre-sold i.e.
new revenue growth that would come on to the GAAP statements this year among that half that's not pre-sold we can already see in the pipeline about 70% of the volume we expect for the year.
So we're really optimistic about the year.
Now it's January 24.
And as Jay mentioned we didn't raise guidance beyond the financing and the T-Mobile acquisition because it's so early in the year.
But it's encouraging that we can see in the pipeline 70% of the application volume that we expect among that half that's not pre-sold.
So let's hope that continues and we see continued activity and you could certainly see increases throughout the year.
But we'll just have to see.
Our next question is from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just a couple questions maybe first on capital spending if you could just maybe walk through different line items.
I think one in particular that was a little bit higher than we had expected was the Tower Improvement line.
So help us think through what's going on there.
And as part of that just sort of initial augmentations on the T-Mobile towers and how you would think about that in 2013? And then maybe just one on sort of granularity.
The non-cash revenues were down fairly significantly quarter-over-quarter.
Maybe just some sort of help on what's going on there? Sure.
On the first question around capital spending we saw an increase in the fourth quarter both on land purchases.
Obviously some of the changes that happened and expected changes that were happening with the tax codes caused some people to want to sell properties earlier than maybe they otherwise would have.
So we benefited from that and increased the spend that we would have on land purchases during the fourth quarter.
And then the amount of activity as Ben alluded to in his comments that we're seeing from the carriers is driving a lot of tenant adds to our sites.
So we saw an increase in spending there.
And usually there's a push as there was in this past period.
Usually there's a push in the fourth quarter and we certainly saw that.
We certainly saw that this fourth quarter.
I think as we think about the full year 2013 as I alluded to in my comments from a CapEx standpoint we'll probably end up spending about $150 million related to the land lease extension program as we purchase land.
We'll spend probably another $150-or-so million related to construction of new sites which would include and would be mostly comprised of small-cell-related activities.
And then probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million or a little over $100 million on adding additional tenants to existing either towers or DAS systems.
And as we think about what we think we'll spent on T-Mobile obviously that activity around spend is completely tied to leasing activity.
And in terms of the structural capacity and ability to do that we think those assets in terms of the cost to add additional tenants will look very similar to our existing portfolio.
So I think it will largely just be determined by what does leasing activity as we go through the course of the year look like.
But the $100 million we think will largely cover that based on Ben's comments around what we're seeing on the current activity levels Jason.
The second question around on cash obviously as we began to focus a year ago on this AFFO metric -- and believe it's a great one because it focuses everybody on a cash -- on a cash side rather than thinking about it just from GAAP revenues and GAAP expenses the business is comprised largely of these lease -- long-dated lease arrangements both in terms of revenue and cost.
And as we have movements in those there are effects that happened to that AFFO number either increases in non-cash revenues or decreases off the revenue line.
And the same thing occurs at the expense line.
So there's some volatility that was seen in that number over time based on the timing of payments and the arrangements that we make.
Obviously anything that we do where a lease has a prepaid component related to it that would have an impact or a postpaid if you will component to it.
That would also have an impact to those numbers.
And then add to that in the fourth quarter we also did the T-Mobile transaction.
So all of the -- all of those existing leases both at the revenue line and expense line came through.
So we have -- as we talked about I think a little bit last quarter we've historically guided that number a bit conservatively.
It's difficult for us to have quite as much precision as we can at the site rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA line so we've guided that number a bit conservatively.
And I think as I've mentioned in past calls we would expect as you look at the delta between non-cash revenues straight-line revenues and straight-line expenses there a bit of a drag on the EBITDA if you will as we move down to the AFFO and the cash line.
We expect that that gap will completely close by -- within the next 3 to 4 years.
So the trend line there should be a movement towards AFFO and EBITDA coming a little closer together.
So hopefully that's helpful on the second question.
Our next question is from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> A quick housekeeping question.
First the $5 million of non-recurring revenue what's the EBITDA impact on that? And then Ben I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more clarity.
You talked already a lot about small cells and DAS.
I think a year ago on this call you said you were hopeful that you could grow this business EBITDA 5x to 6x over the next 5 years.
And I'm just wondering if you could sort of update us on where we are on that sort of trajectory and what do you see for 2013? That -- it'd be great to get some more -- just some more clarity on sort of materiality here.
Okay.
Simon on the first question we did have $5 million of revenues benefit in the fourth quarter and it was largely offset -- remember in our outlook for fourth quarter we did not include the T-Mobile transaction.
So we didn't include the costs associated with adding folks for that transaction either.
So most of that was offset by the additional cost and staffing cost that we had in the quarter.
If you were trying to exclude it there wasn't necessarily an offset directly related to that so it would have fallen through.
But if you're trying to compare that to the outlook we gave previously most of it was consumed by cost increases that we have not previously guided to related to the T-Mobile transaction.
Simon my enthusiasm around the small-cell business has not abated at all.
We've got 9 months of operating with the NextG folks and we are adding resources as I mentioned earlier which is evidence of our commitment and enthusiasm for the business.
I still believe you'll see us grow that number 4x to 5x over what we bought over that period of time.
We're finding significant opportunities to put capital to work and very attractive all-in returns.
And we're seeing a continued migration of capital spending and commitment on the part of carriers to the small-cell technologies and architectures.
I would also mention on this call don't be confused by a lot of the -- what we see out in the press around confusing nomenclature around small cells and DAS and what does it look like in picocells.
The real critical element that we offer is the property rights that we have secured and the fiber that connects whatever architecture whatever electronics the carriers ultimately want to install.
And so while they -- it may have initially been a shared DAS system where you had multiple carriers in each box if you will to otherwise going into the small-cell environment of picocells next pullover.
The economics to us and the benefits to the carriers of the shared economic proposition of the largest component of cost being the fiber and the rights that we secure that's all well intact.
And so we try not to get distracted if you will in the -- with what's going on out there in the marketplace.
We're able to accommodate really all of this through what we're doing in the business.
And our enthusiasm frankly has increased over time and like very much what we see there.
And it's certainly confirmed by public statements on the part of most of the major carriers.
Our next question is from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investments.
Research Division</strong> I was just wondering if you could provide just a little bit more details on the bridge for 2013 revenue growth? So you mentioned that there's -- the $330 million of growth implied in your guidance ranges from 2012 I think you mentioned $270 million from acquisitions and $60 million in leasing activity.
But as I put that $60 million of leasing activity over last year's numbers and try to make a couple of adjustments for some of the acquisitions that were included for part of 2012 I'm only coming up with about 3% to 4% revenue growth.
Now I was just wondering if you can bridge these numbers to the organic revenue growth to get a cleaner sense of what the cash growth looks like for 2013? Yes Mike thanks for the question.
I think the $60 million is obviously a year-over-year comparison and there's a couple of things that would affect that.
If -- one of the things that I mentioned was what's -- is the contracted escalators on the existing leases net of churn.
We expect churn in 2013 to be about 1% maybe a little less than 1%.
So that number is at levels a little bit lower than what we've seen over the last couple of years.
We think that will offset the benefit of about 1% of rent escalations that we would see in the number.
So the $60 million that you're correctly highlighting that number would reflect basically all -- that would all be organic growth or new tenants going on the existing systems.
And that would be a combination of new tenants on towers as well as new tenants going on DAS systems.
There's another -- if you parse through the numbers and look at -- to Jason's question earlier about what are the movements in the straight-line revenues there's another about $40 million to $50 million of benefit from cash escalations on existing leases which is why when you look at the AFFO growth that we're showing for the year of about $190 million of AFFO growth about 80 -- a little over $80 million of that is obviously coming from the interest expense save.
And then we've got about $110 million that's coming from the base business.
T-Mobile is -- when you add the combination of the financing costs there and the increase in cost T-Mobile is basically a push.
So we're not getting any benefit really at the AFFO line from T-Mobile when you consider the cost increases that Ben referred to.
So that $110 million would be what we're getting in the organic leasing business a combination of cash escalations and leasing and not really getting any benefit on that cash line from contracted escalations that are variable in nature.
So hopefully that reconciles you -- reconciles it down.
I just listened -- just listening I want to just make sure that's -- so that $110 million would also be after normal growth and operating expenses x people costs.
So normal growth and site maintenance and ground leases and things.
So you're basically dropping $110 million through to AFFO.
And just to be doubly clear the T-Mobile accretion net of financing costs that $20 million is basically covering the increased run rate of people costs resources as I talked about which is basically paying for the resources we've added through the services business the DAS business and all the things we enumerated earlier.
So that's basically Mike I think the easiest way to sort of cut through it.
And then to get back to the $190 million is about the $80 million or so of interest save.
Research Division</strong> That's really helpful.
And if I can just ask one other follow-up to that on the $80 million of interest saves as you look at all the refinancing activity that you've now completed is there another leg down of interest cost for 2014 or '15? Or should we look at that $80 million of interest save as really the getting back to I guess the run rate of current interest cost in the market today? Yes.
I think on -- there is one other bond out there the 7.5% -- 7.25% $500 million -- 7.5% $500 million notes that we would look to potentially refinance over time.
But if you look at the whole balance sheet $11 billion the average coupon is at about 4.5%.
So at 4.5% I think we've gotten most of it out at this point.
Our next question is from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Two if I could.
First of all can you give us a little additional color on now that you actually own or lease I guess the assets the strategy for lease-up on the T-mobile tower? Are there particular carriers that you think are most likely to be picked up there et cetera? And secondly can you talk about what sort of lease-up activity you're seeing in areas where there's already LTE? So Verizon activity in I guess by now the bulk of the country and AT&amp;T? Are you starting to see infill? Or is it still most of the activity you're seeing for just POP coverage at this point? Yes James thanks.
With T-Mobile -- and thanks I was hoping we'd get to address this.
We've owned it 60 days and we're still in this transition period working through loading all the data in the systems and beginning to take applications on our own from carriers.
So there'll be a little bit of an integration process that'll last probably another 90 days until we're completely essentially integrated.
But we already are having productive conversations and would -- have very high expectations as we talked about on the last last quarter's call for those sites going forward.
It's early days.
And so we wouldn't put a whole lot of that in the 2013 run rate if you will in terms of contribution inside the year.
But nonetheless we're seeing pretty -- we're having very good conversations and have very high expectations for the long-term growth prospects there.
And coming off of a very low base of run rate of tenancy as we've talked about before it doesn't take a whole lot of additional tenants to make that investment perform exceptionally well.
So we're probably more enthusiastic about it 60 days in than even when we started.
And that could be a potential source down the road for outperformance if we see things happening as we would certainly hope.
With respect to sell splitting James and infill locations I would tell you that it's too early to raise guidance based on that.
And remember that anything we would see incremental for the year would only have a stub period contribution for '13 that would be more meaningful into '14.
So it wouldn't be a huge amount for '13.
But I would tell you that when I -- my previous comments about where we can already see 70% of the application volume we expect on the non-pre-sold activity some of that is clearly coming from that activity.
And so we're optimistic we'll see that continue to build throughout '13.
And it's sort of a very good next leg of growth for us going forward particularly given the 22 000 sites Jay mentioned now with the T-Mobile portfolio the 22 000 sites that we have inside the top 100 markets.
We think it's -- we have lots of sites that are going to be very attractive for infill and cell splitting.
And we'll just have to see how that develops.
But certainly we think it's headed in the right direction.
Our next question is from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions if I could.
First just want to go back to the straight-line stuff a second.
Obviously a lot of people are confused by straight-line still.
Jay I think just to make sure I understood you correctly you feel that while it's a volatile line item that you guys are being very conservative on your guidance still and how you take people through that.
And I think I heard you say 3 to 4 years before that adjustment goes away? That's right.
And trending towards that.
So the line should trend towards that.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Second question.
With the pending T-Mobile PCS acquisition T-Mobile has made it very clear they want to keep the MetroPCS DAS networks that have been built in New York Boston Philly and California.
I believe a lot of those were built by NextG which you guys own.
T-Mobile explicitly said they want to add LTE and HSPA Plus to that.
Is that in your guidance? Does that help you guys? Or is it something that they just spend CapEx on by their own? Yes Rick.
I don't want to really get into specifics on what may or may not happen contractually with those upgrades.
In many cases they will take additional slots on those systems which will be a revenue event for us.
And so I'm not sure we would put that fine a point on the revenue guidance.
There's certainly an expectation and internal budgeting and forecasting around the small-cell business and it comes from a lot of different places.
And as we've talked about for years if you forecast -- if you're within 70% accuracy on exactly where it comes from inside a given year you've done pretty well.
But so implicitly some of that's -- it's sort of in our thinking.
But I wouldn't put too fine a point on that.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So if it does happen there could be a little more upside to that as well just kind of -- if DAS does play out? There could be.
Sure.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then on the cell splitting we've heard that the leader in deploying LTE in the United States has put out search rings to look at that cell splitting to create LTE capacity.
I think as you were mentioning does that kind of imply that if search rings are out are you seeing them and that it is probably by a midyear-type event that you might see some of that activity show up at the towers? I think that's a pretty fair assessment but I don't want to scope that for you yet.
And we don't make it a practice to talk about our carriers' business.
So let's let them talk about that in detail.
But I think certainly some of that we're seeing in the pipeline.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Makes sense.
I'll ask you something you can answer directly stock buybacks.
What do you think about getting your leverage back down into your target zone? And as you look at the CapEx program and acquisitions and -- where does stock buyback and leverage fit in to kind of your thoughts of running your business? Sure.
Broadly what I would tell you in terms of capital allocation we haven't changed the plan.
We look at every dollar of capital that we spend and the goal is to maximize long-term cash flow per share as we -- and we measure AFFO per share.
So we put everything from construction of new small-cell sites to tower sites to buying back stock or acquisitions.
All of them run through that risk-adjusted filter that we put everything through.
And we continue to look at opportunities there and feel like we had a good year of putting cash to work money to work on acquisitions primarily that we thought we're better frankly than what the opportunity was of us buying back the stock.
And so we'll continue to look at opportunities in that same vein and on the go forward.
With regards to the deployment of leverage to do those activities we obviously over the course of the year took leverage up about a turn in the quarter to take advantage of some opportunities that we saw.
We thought it was shareholder friendly not to issue shares to do the acquisitions that we did.
And given the low cost of debt in the market and the term that we could achieve we thought that was appropriate.
I do think over time what you'll see us do is come back down as we grow EBITDA and bring the leverage back down to the 4x to 6x target level that we'll operate the business at most of the time and aiming to get ourselves back in terms of -- back to -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 5x debt to adjusted EBITDA.
We may from time to time use some portion of our cash flow to pay down debt but I don't think that will be any meaningful allocation of the cash flow.
I think most of the deleveraging is likely to come from just growth in adjusted EBITDA.
I would just add I think Jay you mentioned we are probably at the highest interest coverage -- interest coverage has actually gone up through this refinancing and through the increased debt we took on to do these acquisitions.
Interest coverage as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA is actually higher than when we started which is pretty phenomenal.
And as we look back about being disciplined over a long period of time around the capital structure I would observe that we've taken EBITDA in this company from somewhere around $700 million to $1.6 billion run rate and not issued any shares.
And we've done that through a lot of investment and a lot of organic growth.
But that's how you get to $3.04 a share.
And this year we'll have as we've talked about over $1 billion of adjusted funds from operations.
So we're quite pleased with that outcome.
Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
LLC Research Division</strong> I was interested in following up on your DAS business.
And can you give us a sense of how much revenue and cash flow contribution are coming from those assets? And Ben I think you talked about over 10 000 small-cell nodes and maybe you could provide a perspective on how that compares with previous periods post the close of the NextG transaction? Yes John.
Let me say -- first of all I'm probably -- I don't want to break out -- we're not going to segment report.
I mean we operate it as the same business.
We look at it on a return basis on capital we're putting in.
As Jay mentioned we're making significant capital investments on the build side.
And that goes through our normal capital allocation processing.
We're very pleased with what we see there.
And the growth there in terms of revenue is at or above our expectations and deal pipeline.
Obviously we've put additional resources in it as we've talked about which cost money in the short run to build out that capacity and enable us to handle that pipeline that's continuing to grow.
So that's probably all I would say.
It's -- other than to say that we're continuing to be very pleased with the growth we're seeing revenue and margins and the opportunities in the marketplace to put real money to work at very attractive returns which is what we had thought when we came into this.
And importantly it's the same financial model and proposition that we can offer to customers which is the compelling nature of the shared infrastructure where it's cheaper for them to go on our sites and operate on our sites notwithstanding the ease and speed-to-market that it creates just on a pure financial basis just as it is on the towers.
And that relationship is well intact and I think will certainly continue.
So we are not breaking it out separately but we own it.
It's paying its way and we certainly expect to see the kind of returns out of it that we initially modeled.
LLC Research Division</strong> And then -- Ben you gave some very helpful comments on small-cell and DAS and some of the nomenclature confusion and so forth.
Is it correct to assume then that the basic architecture that NextG had used you're open to expanding that to other approaches as long as your kind of leveraging the core fiber assets? Absolutely.
And we're working on that everyday right now.
LLC Research Division</strong> So given your fiber assets I just wondered if there's an element of your DAS business where you will consider providing backhaul but not operator maintaining nodes themselves? Perhaps the carriers prefer to build them or already built them but you could leverage fiber in more of a direct backhaul way as well as operating the small-cell business? Yes John.
We are doing that in a limited -- in limited geographies today where -- it's obvious where we could provide dark fiber where we've got overpass [ph] in cell sites.
So we've got that in a limited way today.
And I would say it's a significant meaningful contribution but it's certainly a way to leverage that embedded plant.
And that's something we're going to continue to focus on.
Our next question is from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> This is Richard for Phil.
I just wanted to ask on the T-Mobile towers.
If you were going to kind of change tower heights how long does that take if -- granted it's still early in the integration process? But is this something that can be done very quickly in terms of getting through zoning or not? Or once you decide to do it it's going to take a while and would end up being more of an impact in 2014 or beyond? Yes.
Richard not really a difference per se in a T-Mobile site going through zoning on changing height as we would on our own sites.
I mean it's a process.
It depends on where you are in terms of zoning.
But what I would also point out is that over time as the equipment has gotten smaller and lighter and the desire for tall sites frankly has abated because now we're covering much smaller cell sites diameters it's more and more likely that these sites become available and useful to a carrier without necessarily augmenting the height of the tower.
And that's something that we've seen change over the last 10 years in the industry.
Very often times the smaller sites based on their location and the smaller electronics and the tighter separation that we're able to put the different rad centers on the sites make it such that these smaller sites actually have more utility than they might have when they were originally built.
And we're seeing that on our own portfolio and we continue to expect to see that on the T-Mobile sites as we move forward.
Research Division</strong> And I guess is it fair to say then that given where things are that most of the most recent activity over the past few years are probably on smaller sites? And so the bigger sites are taken and it's not...
Well -- and again a lot of the activity -- the majority of the activity in the industry the last couple of years has been LTE amendment activity on existing installations.
So there's not been a lot of new leasing in the marketplace.
As we've talked about on this call we expect that to gradually change over time with infill and capacity cell splits.
But the last 2 to 3 years it's -- the vast majority has been upgrade of existing installs.
Next question is from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Research Division</strong> Great.
Most of my questions have been asked and answered but I do have a few additional.
First in terms of the EBITDA outlook you look at the first quarter and you look at the annualized number that you've given and it seems like EBITDA is not going to grow through much of the year.
Now earlier you highlighted how given your MLAs a lot of the potential revenue growth or the cash revenue growth is already captured in your GAAP numbers.
So I'm wondering if this is kind of a similar impact on your EBITDA? And then I'll come back with a follow-up.
Yes Jonathan.
It's the same answer as the answer to Mike's question about revenue.
Research Division</strong> All right great.
And then could you give us the details in terms of the split between amendments and new cell activity as it applied to the fourth quarter? And for -- that's embedded in the outlook for 2013? We're currently seeing about 85% of the activity to be amendment-related.
Most of that would be LTE-related activity and 15% would be brand new tenants going on the towers.
And we have a similar assumption for 2013.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And just as a follow-up to that in terms of the 3G overlays and kind of the time periods that were overlay versus kind of moving into some capacity infills how -- maybe you can relate that experience as to where we are in the kind of that 4G upgrade cycle? I guess what I would say is historically as we've gone through the process you end up with a period of time -- generally it's a 2- to 4-year period of time where the carriers go back and touch the sites that they're already on.
And during that period of time where they're doing the initial deployment of whatever the new generation of technology is we see the leasing results similar to what I was just speaking to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 75% to 80% of the activity to being amendments.
And then as they move towards -- having touched all their existing sites then we see that transition go back much more towards brand new cell sites and cell splitting.
And obviously there's been a number of carriers who commented on that as they roll out their plans for the next couple of years and talk about the need that they have to go back in infill sites cell split add additional sites where the activity has been over the last couple of years more in the amendment time frame.
So I think we would say probably balance of '13 looks like that will continue to be a heavily amendment-tied activity base.
And then as we transition into '14 probably early '14 mid-'14 we start to move back towards a more normal cycle.
Our next question is from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
One your commentary about churn.
How do you think that will trend throughout the year? Do you expect any ramp from the iDEN churn in the second half? Or is that more a 2014 event? And is there any level of discussions with Sprint right now maybe to lock that churn with increased activity from Sprint? That's something that you could do this year? Also another question on maintenance CapEx.
I think you lowered your outlook for this year and you have more towers including T-Mobile [ph] in your base.
Can you talk about what drove that reduction? Sure.
On the first question with iDEN we don't expect to see any churn from iDEN in the calendar year 2013.
We would expect to see that in 2014 and 2015 in terms of impacting the revenues.
We believe that we'll be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 3% of revenues.
And for assumption purposes I would expect we'll see somewhere in the neighborhood of 2/3 to 3/4 of that in calendar year 2014 and then the balance of it in 2015.
At least if I was trying to predict it at this early stage that's the best I could do.
But I don't -- contractually they don't have the right to do any of that in 2013.
On the maintenance CapEx side some of the change there that we gave in the outlook was us pulling forward into the fourth quarter some of the IT upgrade that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.
So we actually got that done in the fourth quarter along with some of the tower maintenance activities.
We were able to pull that forward into the fourth quarter.
And so it's really just moving those expenses between the 2 periods and bringing some of that -- we brought some of that activity and work.
We were able to get it done a little earlier than what we had previously expected.
Our next question is from the line of Mike McCormack with Newman Securities (sic) [Nomura Securities].
Research Division</strong> Just looking at the maintenance CapEx run rate it looks like it's a pretty similar level if we look at '12 versus the guide on '13.
Just trying to get a sense with a much larger tower portfolio what the piece parts are there? Then secondly thinking about M&amp;A opportunities it would seem that domestically there's not much left.
Do you guys have any thoughts about revisiting some of the international opportunities? On the first question with regards to maintenance we spent -- in 2012 we had the IT refresh that I mentioned an upgrade which was out of normal experience in terms of the amount we would spend on a normalized basis to maintain the towers.
And then the amounts that we would see in '13 obviously that has the impact of T-Mobile coming in.
So when you're comparing year-to-year I think the cover that we had in '12 was the increase related to IT.
And so it doesn't look like it's a large step as it would otherwise.
Typically maintenance CapEx per tower is relatively low.
I mean we spend between $500 and $700 per tower per year on maintenance CapEx.
And so there's not really a big uplift related from -- directly from towers.
But in the year-over-year comparison it would just be the elevated amount we're spending in '12.
And a lot of it runs through the P&amp;L on a current basis just as we fix things ongoing.
Mike on your second question around M&amp;A every time we think there's not something else to do something comes up in this industry.
So I would caution you to say there's nothing else to do.
I don't know about that.
But I would say that as we have always done we'll look at anything and we continue to look at really everything on the market including international.
We have -- we haven't talked about it on this call but we've had a very nice growth in our Australian business.
We are forecasting good growth again in 2013.
There's a lot of activity going on in that market.
Other international markets we certainly could look at.
Again we do it on a risk-adjusted basis against the stock price and decide "Where do we find the best opportunity to drive AFFO per share long term?" And thus far you've seen us take advantage of the opportunities we've seen as we have.
But I wouldn't predict the future.
I'd say let's -- we'll continue to do it that way and see what happens.
And I would never say that there's nothing else on the market.
You just never know in this business.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Ben when you think about the tower portfolios of both AT&amp;T and Verizon has there been any change in their posture? On their interest in maintaining versus selling? Not that I'm aware of.
Obviously you'd have to visit with them.
Our next question is from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
If you look at CapEx minus land purchases over site revenue the figure has grown from 7% in Q1 to 19% in Q4.
While some of that is for new DAS nodes revenue-enhancing CapEx on existing sites looks like it's gone up from about $26 million in Q1 to over $51 million in Q4.
Can you give us the breakdown of that existing site CapEx between the IT upgrade core CCI sites T-Mo sites and DAS sites? On the DAS portion is there any element of maintenance CapEx on the fiber nodes in there? And can you clarify for us how you account for carrier reimbursements for DAS CapEx? Is this booked as site revenue? Okay.
In terms of the granularity on CapEx we spend about $10 million related to the -- $8 million related to IT.
So that clears off that component of it for you.
Most of the CapEx as we've seen the rise over the course of the year and over the last couple of years most of that would be related to an increase in activity that we're seeing.
Obviously all of the -- that's driving the services business.
So on the services side we're seeing services revenue as we install tenants and add largely as I mentioned in my prior comments a significant portion of that related to the LTE upgrade.
So we're adding equipment.
We get the services revenue associated with that.
And then there is in some cases a component of that where we're adding additional CapEx to our sites.
I mean given the scale of our DAS business relative to the tower business the vast majority of CapEx on existing sites is related to towers and not related to the small-cell business.
On the construction of new sites revenue-generating on new sites almost all of that is small cells.
And then with regards to your last question as to the extent that we get carrier contributions related to CapEx whether that's on the tower side or on the DAS side the way we would account for that is that that would be -- a portion of that would be rent revenues that we would recognize over the term of the contracted contract the contracted lease.
And then obviously we would receive cash in the current period associated with that.
Our next question is from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just a couple of questions for you.
With regard to the T-Mobile towers I think if I have my math right your guidance implied on the revenue based on the EBITDA margins -- it looks like the EBITDA incremental margins were around 37% 38%.
I was wondering if you could walk us through your thoughts of kind of where this might move going forward? Kind of how long it would take? What are some of the steps you'll be looking at? And then as far as anything you're looking at internationally can you talk us through how you think about return on invested capital in any particular market other than the U.S.? On the first question Michael you're right.
We did bring those assets over to about a 37% margin direct margin off of the revenues.
That's a function of having about 1.6 tenants on them today.
And the growth in those margins as you know is largely a function of what leasing looks like.
The incremental margins on adding an additional tenant to these sites is very high.
So we've taken -- when we first acquired the portfolio of assets that we had prior to T-Mobile in the early days back in 1999 we acquired those assets with about 1.3 tenants on them.
And the margins were in the low -- the high 20s low 30% depending on which portfolio they were.
Today those direct margins on those assets is in the 80% range and that's largely a function of adding in many cases 2.5 or more tenants to the tower.
So really it's a function of how do we add tenants over time.
As we talked about when we did the T-Mobile transaction we assumed a little less than a tenant add thought that the assets could hold a full tenant addition to them given the current capacity of the assets.
And without necessarily getting the margins on those sites all the way to the same level as our legacy portfolio the returns are incredibly incredibly high with just adding 0.5 to 1 tenant on those assets.
So time will tell and it'll largely be a function of leasing.
Mike on your second question in terms of how we think about risk-adjusted sort of hurdle rates and things the way we do it internally is we constantly are updating our thoughts and variables around our internal cash flow-generating capacity of the business we own.
And we translate that into a cash flow per share number the AFFO number you see on the sheet.
We didn't look at the long-term growth rate of that and how we can grow that from the base business that we own in any given time.
And we look at the slope of that line.
And as we're looking at domestic acquisitions that would have a similar risk profile similar credit we see -- it's as simple as is it accretive or not to that slope of that line which would otherwise include just buying back stock as sort of the default candidate for how you would spend the money.
And if we see an opportunity to add accretion to that number as we have been very aggressive in this last 12 months with $4 billion of acquisitions then we'll move on that.
As we look at international markets one of the things we look at and we add to that mix is what is the inherent cost of debt in that market? What is sort of the risk-free rate in those markets? Because at its essence we're essentially a lender to wireless carriers.
We're lending them steel as opposed to dollars or -- and so when we think about it that way it definitely puts a risk premium or a higher hurdle rate depending on the country.
And thus far notwithstanding some growth in those markets thus far we haven't seen something that we're willing to pull the trigger on and win an auction over given some of the other opportunities we've seen in the space.
That's not to say that there are not some good opportunities out there and we may do something in the future.
But that's been our judgment as we've talked about on this call where we see the growth opportunity on a risk-adjusted basis in the U.S.
and the Australian market.
And our final question is from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
Research Division</strong> Jay just on the AFFO redeployment.
It sounds like you're happy with debt levels.
You've done a major acquisition here you've accelerated some land repurchases.
Not to put words in your mouth but it seems like stock buybacks are really the best option at this point unless -- and can you handle another acquisition if you could? And then maybe secondly Ben do you think -- have the carriers caught up with customer demand at this point? It seems like they've been under-engineering the networks for the last 2 3 years.
But do you think they've been surprised with LTE uptake and usage? Just some thoughts on the overall network.
Sure.
Sure.
Tim I think on your first question as Ben mentioned every time that we think the environment has settled and we have great clarity on what it's going to look like for the coming months or quarters something else will come up in terms of an asset or otherwise.
And so we have historically looked at our capital and the investment of that capital based on what we think maximizes long-term cash flow per share.
And so I would give you the same answer.
And as we look at it we would love to find more opportunities to invest in land purchases and acquiring ground lease assets.
We'd love -- based on the returns that we're seeing in the small-cell business we'd love to allocate more capital towards that endeavor.
Happy to buy back shares if we can't find another alternative or potentially acquire assets.
So we'll just have to see what's in front of us.
And we'll make the -- what we believe to be the best decision based on maximizing long-term cash flow per share when the opportunities are in front of us.
The -- in terms of the networks Tim for the -- what we see in the market I'm an interested wireless consumer like all of us on this phone call.
And I look at things at CES and I look at press releases and things and I don't think the market nearly has caught up with customer demand or carrier -- or consumer demand.
I think that's a very difficult goal because I think the market continues to develop new devices and new applications and new ways to use wireless spectrum.
So I think there's going to be a long road here on devices and capabilities and services that we probably can't even imagine particularly when you look at some of the machine-to-machine and automotive and other ways to offload what you normally would think of as a desktop Internet experience that -- now it's very clear.
In a mobile environment we all use it considerably more than in a wired environment.
So we've been at this about 14 years most of us on this call and we've always thought we're going to get to some plateau.
And I think none of us could have appreciated at the time the real technology shift that's happening in all of our lives around wireless.
And we're very pleased to be positioned where we are to have a shared financial model in terms of the shared elements of the infrastructure that is compelling for the carriers to operate on our sites.
We're very pleased with the position that we've created in terms of the largest and the concentration in these top 100 markets as we've talked about.
2012 I think will prove out to be a real watershed year for Crown Castle.
We took some very deliberate actions to enhance our profile if you will in the U.S.
And I think long term that's going to pay tremendous benefits.
And I would just point out as we conclude here today we did 18% AFFO per share growth last year in the midst of an enormous amount of activity around integrating the NextG organization and our friends that joined us there.
In fact if you would just -- for the negative interest carry we took on for the T-Mobile sites we actually hit by 20% bogey for the full year 2012.
And then we've shown up here in January with guidance for you that's 21% on a forward basis.
So we are feeling really good about our business and the prospects and we've got a lot of work to do.
We've got a lot of people working hard on integration at the same time dealing with an unprecedented level of activity in the business.
So a lot going on here but we're very pleased to have you join us on the call everybody.
And we'll talk to you on the first quarter call.
So thank you very much.
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
That does conclude our conference for today.
We'd like to thank you for your participation.

Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
As you've seen from our press release and as outlined on Slide 3 we had an excellent first quarter exceeding the high end of our previously issued guidance for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
We continue to make good progress integrating the T-Mobile towers and expect to be substantially complete within the next few months.
The strong year-to-date results from our site rental revenue business together with the significant contribution from network services in addition to a meaningful increase in applications to go on our sites allow us to increase our 2013 outlook for site rental revenue adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
Turning to Slide 4 I'd like to highlight a few things from our first quarter results.
During the first quarter we generated site rental revenue of $615 million up 24% or $118 million from the first quarter of 2012.
Site rental and gross margin defined as site rental revenues less the cost of operations was $438 million up 17% from the first quarter of 2012.
Our services business performed very well posting another record quarter with the contribution from services gross margin increasing twofold year-over-year from $23 million in the first quarter of 2012 to $47 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2013 was $441 million up 22% from the first quarter of 2012.
AFFO was $291 million up 47% from the first quarter of 2012 and $1 per share up 45% from the first quarter of 2012.
The significant outperformance in the first quarter AFFO compared to our outlook issued in January 2013 was primarily due to the outperformance in adjusted EBITDA that I mentioned and approximately $8 million in contributions related to the construction of conduits the whole customer-owned fiber to our towers.
These contributions are accounted for as deferred site rental revenues and recognized over the estimated period the contributions are earned which is currently about 8 years.
Turning to Slide 5 during the first quarter we spent $116 million on capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $16 million in our land lease purchase program.
Since we began this important effort we have completed over 13 000 individual land transactions.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 75% of our gross margin.
We continue to enjoy significant success with this program as evidenced by the fact that today 37% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own up from less than 15% in January of 2007.
Further the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 32 years.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we spent $7 million on sustaining capital expenditures $94 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures the latter consisting of $58 million on existing sites and $36 million on the construction of new sites.
Additionally we spent $13 million on acquisitions during the first quarter.
Also during the first quarter we purchased approximately 300 000 of our common shares for $24 million.
Since 2003 we have spent $2.8 billion to purchase approximately 101 million of our common shares and potential shares equal to 1/3 of the company's shares.
All of this done at an average price of $27 per share.
During the first quarter we chose to limit our discretionary investments as we're assessing several potential acquisitions.
While we have no assurances that we will be successful in any of these processes the total value of these potential acquisitions would represent less than 3% of our total assets as of the end of this last quarter.
Consistent with our past practice we evaluate these potential acquisitions on their expected long-term contribution to AFFO per share compared to the purchase of our own common shares.
With regards our debt outstanding we ended the first quarter of 2013 with total debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6.1x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of 3.5x.
In April just a few weeks ago we refinanced our existing $1.58 billion Term Loan B and effectively lower the rate on the loan by 75 basis points saving approximately of $12 million in annual interest expense.
Currently the average coupon on our total debt outstanding is 4.5% with an average maturity of 6.5 years.
Turning to our 2013 outlook as shown on Slide 6 we expect site rental revenue of between $612 million and $617 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $426 million and $431 million for the second quarter of 2013.
The sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from Q1 to Q2 in this year is impacted by approximately $4 million of nonrecurring items and site rental revenue that benefited the first quarter of 2013 and are not expected to recur in the second quarter.
Approximately $3 million increase in repairs and maintenance expected in the second quarter reflecting the increased level of activity as the weather warms and a $12 million lower expected contribution from services in the second quarter compared to the contribution we enjoyed in the first quarter.
While we are delighted with the significant contribution from services we are forecasting a lower contribution for the second quarter and the balance of the year.
Over the last couple of years we've been pleasantly surprised by the contribution from services but we will continue to take a conservative view on potential levels of this service activity.
As we mentioned in the press release we have seen a significant increase in applications since the beginning of the year representing a more than twofold increase in the application volume by revenue compared to the same period last year.
This twofold increase in application volume by revenue includes both new and amendment activity.
In the first quarter we saw a similar level of increase in new license applications with new license activity representing 60% of application volume by revenue.
We believe this activity suggests that some of the carriers are in the early stages of infill activity to help ease capacity-related issues.
In addition we are benefiting from amendment activity by the carriers which is outside the scope of previously announced customer agreements wherein we presold certain amendment activity.
I would also point out that the application volume by revenue on the T-Mobile sites we recently acquired is more than double what we expected when we originally forecasted 2013.
As a result of our strong results in the first quarter and the significant increase in application volume from our customers we have increased our 2013 outlook which now reflects annual site rental revenue growth of 17% and AFFO per share growth of 27%.
This increase in our outlook represents an expected increase in incremental growth in site rental gross margin of approximately 18% compared to our original expectations.
Given the expected timing our increase in expected new leasing activity is most impactful to our site rental run rate as we head into 2014.
Turning to Slide 7 in addition to the organic AFFO growth we expect to achieve this year we would expect to augment this growth through opportunistic investment of cash flow and activities such as share purchases tower acquisitions new site construction and land purchases.
Our outlook does not include the benefit from these expected investments.
For the full year 2013 we expect to generate over $1.1 billion of AFFO and invest approximately $400 million to $500 million on capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers the addition of tenants our towers and the construction of new sites leaving approximately $600 million to $700 million to invest in activity related to our core business including purchases of our own shares and tower acquisitions.
Consistent with our past practice we are focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.
I believe this level of capital investment can add between 3% and 5% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate annually.
In summary we had an excellent first quarter and I'm excited about the significant increase we're seeing in leasing applications.
We're off to a great start in 2013.
With that I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
As Jay just mentioned we had an excellent first quarter exceeding our outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
And we're excited about our business as look to the balance of the year.
As you know there's a significant amount of activity in our industry currently as all 4 major U.S.
wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously.
And we're enjoying a significant ramping of leasing activity as reflected in our increased 2013 guidance.
In fact over 75% of the 2013 leasing activity contemplated by our outlook is already in our application pipeline.
As Jay noted we saw more than a twofold increase in application volume by revenue in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year which we expect will translate into new site rental revenue during the second half of 2013.
Of this significant increase in applications in the first quarter 2013 approximately 60% of the activity was from new tenants co-locating on towers they were not previously on.
This is a trend we have been anticipating for some time as some of the carriers are nearing completion of their LTE nationwide build-out.
We have been expecting to see in-fill sites or densification as a second wave of LTE network deployment providing us with a longer runway of expected future growth as the carriers strive to maintain network quality and reliability through cell splitting in the face of exponential growth in mobile technology demand.
Given the urban concentration of our sites with 74% in the top 100 markets where we expect the majority on network densification to occur we are excited about our prospects as the next wave of leasing materializes.
In the first quarter we also made significant progress on the integration of the T-Mobile towers which we expect to complete in the next 3 or 4 months.
While these integration activities are ongoing the business opportunity continues to grow and we are seeing meaningful pent-up demand from carriers to go on these sites.
As Jay mentioned only 4 months post-closing application volume on the T-Mobile sites is already significantly ahead of what we underwrote.
Turning to small cells.
We closed on the NextG acquisition just a little over a year ago and I am very pleased with the performance in the growth of our small cell networks which have exceeded our initial expectations.
In fact the organic leasing growth on small cells is tracking above our business plan and we're excited to be investing for growth in this area.
Our initial expectations upon closing the NextG acquisition were that we would grow adjusted EBITDA 5 to 6x within 5 years and we are tracking towards that goal.
While small cells represents a small percentage of our overall site rental revenue we expect and are seeing growth from small cells contribute significantly more than its relative size to the organization.
This activity is consistent with the continued adoption by the carriers of small cells to create a better and more seamless experience for consumers in areas that are not adequately covered by traditional macro tower infrastructure.
Based on what we can see we anticipate multi-thousand small cell deployments annually for the foreseeable future and we are working to capture a significant portion of this opportunity.
With every passing month we see more examples of Crown Castle offering carriers integrated solutions in towers and small cells to meet their network requirements.
As the industry leader in small cells we remain excited about our future prospects in this extension of our business.
Before I turn the call over to questions I'd like to make some comments on the trends we are seeing in the U.S.
As evidenced by our results and our investment of $4 billion last year in the U.S.
market with the NextG and T-Mobile tower acquisitions we remain firmly convinced that the U.S.
wireless market has significant opportunities as the fastest-growing and most profitable wireless market in the world and where we are well positioned as the preeminent wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S.
According to Cisco's latest forecast U.S.
mobile data traffic grew 62% during 2012 and is expected to grow ninefold from 2012 to 2017 enabled by the faster and more robust LTE networks being deployed.
As carriers deploy LTE it's interesting to note that U.S.
4G connections represent still only 7% of mobile connections today yet they account for 25% of mobile traffic on the networks.
The impact of 4G connections on traffic is significant because 4G connections generate a disproportionate amount of mobile data traffic.
This is the driver behind all 4 major carriers' multiyear plans to enhance the coverage and capacity of their networks.
We believe this is illustrative of U.S.
wireless consumer behavior and is an important trend for our business.
So in closing to wrap up and then we'll take some questions we're the largest wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S.
with an urban-centric portfolio where leasing activity and demand for mobile technology is the highest.
We remain focused on the U.S.
market the largest and fastest-growing market in the world where the ability of wireless carriers to make profitable investments is most apparent and barriers to entry remain high.
As consistently demonstrated by our results we believe our well-located tower portfolio and the ability to execute for customers allows us to maximize the opportunity in the U.S.
market.
Leveraging our experienced management team customer relationships and services offerings across our unrivaled tower footprint together with our leadership in small cell networks positions us to be the provider of choice as carriers continue to enhance their networks to meet ever-increasing wireless demands.
We believe providing carriers access to our 30 000 sites extensive small cells and fiber resources through a shared infrastructure model remains the most efficient means of delivering mobile technology to consumers.
We like how we are positioned and look forward with great anticipation to the future.
It's a privilege to come on these calls and announce these results.
I want to take a quick moment to thank our employees who continue to deliver these excellent results while integrating 2 major acquisitions.
Delivering record levels of services revenues and meeting customers' expectations in gaining access to our sites at the heightened level of application volume we are seeing reflects the talent and dedicated professionals we have at Crown Castle.
So in closing we had an excellent first quarter and we look forward to the balance of the year.
With that operator we'd be pleased to take some questions.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes of the line of Philip Cusick from JP Morgan.
Research Division</strong> I guess first on the fundamentals can you talk about what kind of visibility you have into the services business? As you said it's been surprising you to the upside for quite some time.
Is this contracted a quarter or a month out or is it even shorter than that? And what do you expect in terms of sustainability over the next year or so? Yes Phil thanks.
Obviously it's been growing and we've been doing more including increasing the scope of work on each individual application over time.
But it is hard to forecast.
It's hard to forecast in terms of volume and then as well as timing because not all of the timing relates to things that we can control some of it beyond our control things like zoning availability of equipment lots of other things that actually impact when the timing of the jobs get done and the recognition of revenue.
So given that it is lumpy it has been going up.
In relation to the application volume and the activity that we've seen we have high expectations for it certainly.
And we'd expect that this year full year would be substantially greater than last year.
But still $47 million of margin in the quarter is unprecedented by a long shot for us and so we're going to be a little gentle as we forecast that.
Research Division</strong> Sure.
As you think about the guidance there is that -- services revenue guidance that you give essentially known and then there's extremely likely or only potential upside from there? Or do you really put in on sort of a -- the potential that that could miss during the quarter? Well we try to basically come out with things a level that we obviously are pretty sure we can make.
I don't want to come out on a call and talk to you about why we didn't make a number.
And as we've said given the activity over the last 12 months which has been ever increasing it's been -- we've been beating that number obviously every quarter.
But I'm cautious because there may come a time when that number flat lines or even heads back down and so we just got to be very careful about getting too far out over of our skis on that one.
And again the last thing I would add is remember carriers are not compelled to use us.
And so while we're very pleased with the activity and we work very hard to secure that business they don't have to use us.
So while it is related to the activity in the market we certainly can't absolutely control it.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
If I may on just a completely different subject I think there was an article in I think it was Barron's this weekend talking about how a lot companies are moving toward REIT status and I worry about this.
What are your advisors telling you about the situation in DC towards REITs and is there possibility you might move this ahead a little bit in order to get yourself in '14 rather than wait until '15? Yes sure Phil.
We've already started some of the preliminary work on REIT conversion in terms of considering who our advisors will be and legal counsel and how that would look.
We've spent a considerable amount of time internally looking at what we would need to do in order to make that make the conversion.
I would tell you just broadly and there've been a number of articles written about some of the businesses that are trying to make themselves look at close to real estate as they can in order to pursue a single taxation-type model.
And when you look at the tower business this is a real estate business and certainly when they set up the pass-through entity status and looked at real estate as one of the prime examples that have taken advantage of that that's what we are.
We're a real estate business and it's not a stretch to figure out how our business relates to that.
Broadly on tax reform I mean there may be tax reform over time and if there is tax reform then obviously we'll have to look at what we think is the best approach for the company.
But I think some of the concerns about what the IRS may or may not do in terms of including various businesses in -- as REITs it's hard to imagine how you could define real estate and not include -- and not include towers.
So I think we feel pretty comfortable about it.
And we've started to work and you're right to say we'll burn through our NOL in about 2015 beginning of 2016 and so I think our conversion is in next -- inside of the next 24 to 36 months and we've already started the early work to get that done.
Our next question comes of the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> So I've got -- I was interested in the services business and kind of the cost structure and as revenues go higher or lower is that primarily a fixed cost basis or the variable costs were you using contractors? Just wanted to get a little bit more of a flavor for that.
And then it sounds like from their comments there was a point during 1Q where there was a trigger where you -- that the prepaid amount of activity was sort of exceeded and from this point forward a lot of the activity level then gets reflected in incremental site leasing revenues and am I thinking about that correctly? And are there other MLAs where we might sort of see that trigger later on this year? Yes John I'll take the first one.
On the services business we do have some variable cost structure built into there and we have added people over the last year really almost at an unprecedented rate for Crown Castle given that it's -- we run with lots of assets and few people.
We've added a number of folks to handle this work load.
We do have some variable cost in there a number of them are contractors.
I think the essence of your question is if it were to flex down can some of the cost structure come out? And the answer is absolutely.
And so we always keep an eye on what do we think is sort of baseline core services activity and then what is -- what are we seeing based on all this activity appreciating that we've added 1/3 to the portfolio too so you're going to have a higher increasing rate of activity just because the portfolio's bigger.
But there is a significant amount of variable cost in that business that could flex appropriately.
John your second question around prepaid activity.
As you probably saw from the release we add an additional footnote to the straight-line revenue disclosure that we've given over the last year plus when we went through this AFFO metric that the industry has gone to to show you the one component of that number that has some volatility in it which is related to prepaid activity.
So we've called that we've called that out.
And in periods where there's a significant amount of construction and activity going on we're going to see more prepaid.
I think we've talked about in past quarters directionally that straight-line revenue number in the absence of any construction activity is headed to about breakeven in the 2016 timeframe.
And so if -- just as a simple example if you were to say we didn't have any prepaid activity in 2016 we would expect the current drag that is straight-line revenue of about $130 million to go to 0.
So just growth in absolute cash received from our tenant licenses is going to grow significantly over the next couple of years.
So we were trying to spike that out a little bit to show you that the one component of that that does have some volatility.
And I guess I'll make a similar comment to what I made around services that we'll continue to take a pretty conservative view there.
And it's a -- a lot of it comes down from timing.
I think directionally we feel great about the year which you can certainly take from our comments about where application volume is.
And then with regard to services and construction activities we'll have to see how it develops over the course of the year.
It's harder for us to predict exactly where those items are going to fall.
LLC Research Division</strong> And then finally on the applications you talked about and the kind of the increased levels for new colo applications does that then really start to hit the financials not until 2014 or could that benefit this year's site leasing performance? It does reflect somewhat in calendar year 2013.
As I mentioned in my comments we took up our fourth quarter site rental gross margin in terms of incremental growth year-over-year by about 18%.
So that's a direct result of that leasing activity and the applications that we're seeing.
It is as you point out though most impactful to the 2014 run rate.
Generally speaking we have about 4 to 5 months from the date we receive an application until it becomes revenue.
So that application activity that we saw in the first quarter really becomes revenue into the third quarter and gets the -- you get the impact there for the balance of this year but most impactful as we think about run rates into 2014.
And I think we are really encouraged about broadly what we see the carriers working on and where that application activity is going as we transition from what has been the last couple of years a predominantly an amendment mix to now seeing a significant number of brand new lease applications where carriers are going -- desiring to go on towers they're not currently co-located on.
And that's having a big impact as we think about in the fourth quarter and where we head into 2014.
Our next question comes of the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
I want follow-up on Phil's REIT question and as we get ready to go to NAREIT pretty soon.
Jay you mentioned the conversion in 24 to 36 months.
Given that tax status is for a calendar year would you actually maybe consider converting to a REIT in the middle of the year? And how would that kind of logistically work given the accumulated EMP dividend payment et cetera? Yes I think the first step after we lay out the plan is to pursue the private lateral ruling from the IRS.
There have been a number of tower companies and land lease companies that have gone down this path both public and private companies.
So there's a good track record there in terms of how the IRS responds to this so we feel pretty good about that.
But that would be the next step.
And then once we've received that private letter ruling then it just becomes an election for us to convert to a REIT.
And those 2 things don't necessarily have to go together so we could pursue and obtain a private letter ruling and then wait before -- wait to make the REIT conversion decision at a later date.
And I think I've broadly discussed here how we think about capital allocation in that discussion.
And given the amount of growth that we're seeing in the business and where we see cash flow per share growing over the next couple of years we thought it appropriate to maintain the flexibility to use our cash flow to be able to go out and either buy acquisitions or buy back our own shares.
We think we've done that really successfully over a long period of time.
And so by waiting on the dividend until it's the most tax advantageous approach in the business we think we can deliver outsized returns to the shareholders.
But it's something that we're certainly considering and I wouldn't dismiss the possibility that we don't go a little bit early.
And we're just in the early stages of working on it and would make the decision when appropriate.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And would it be a decision that would be tied to a January 1 kind of date like American Tower did for the whole tax year? Or is it something you could do within a tax year and go back? Just trying to think of the kind of calendar timing.
I think the practical answer is we would probably do it on January 1.
There are ways you wouldn't necessarily have to do that but in all likelihood we would think about it as a calendar year decision.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> That makes great sense.
And one follow up on the T-Mobile side.
You said it was doing twice your forecast the T-Mobile towers that you've brought in.
Is that just that you guys started the underwriting maybe thinking that they would start slowly? And then also on the 60% of the applications have new colos as kind of a revenue base are the T-Mobile ones seeing that too I would expect? Yes.
Rick this is Ben.
So on the -- look it's only been 4 months so we're happy to tell you that we're ahead of plan but it's 4 months in and we obviously had a long-term leasing forecast.
But we're ahead of plan significantly already with the T-Mobile assets.
And yes I would suggest to you that they're tracking colos as well as amendment activity.
Our next question comes of the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Research Division</strong> Great.
I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of the activity by carrier? And then as a second question you talked about the timeframe from getting an application to seeing that application turn into revenue and I imagine that 4 to 5 months for new sites is longer than what you might -- in an amendment process.
If that is the case do you feel like you have more visibility into the forward business today than maybe what you were expecting a quarter or 2 quarters ago? Jonathan let me start with the first part on -- by carrier.
We generally resist calling out individual carriers and their deployment plans and what's going on.
Obviously we have a pretty good window into that from our seat.
But you can certainly take from their comments the carriers' public disclosure where they are in terms of their initial LTE deployment.
And they're in varying stages of completion if you will in the first level of amendment activity through their existing networks.
And as we've anticipated for some time we will see infill or densification resulting from either increased small cells in areas where there's -- they're capacity-challenged where consumers essentially are consuming the LTE capacity that's now available on the macro site.
Or now a redeployment of capital back into adding additional sites that may have been on the list for a long time but would be prioritized based upon the need to go ahead and get the original first cut sort of LTE deployment overlay done and now they've come back and addressed the obvious places that for some time they've needed some help which is handled first and foremost by macro sites and then obviously infill in more urban areas by small cells.
So we're seeing that -- I would say almost in direct relation to where the carrier is in their LTE deployment.
So that's about as far as I'll go with you but you can sort of walk through okay where is everybody in their LTE deployment and you can assume that's sort of how we're seeing this play out.
The 4- to 5-month lag on application to revenue is pretty consistent; that hasn't really changed over time.
I mean -- and there's some variables in there that we control and there's some variables in there that are out of our control things like again availability of equipment zoning availability of crews.
I mean there's just a lot of things that have to happen there.
Consents from landlords.
Just a long list of things that typically on average takes in that 4- to 5-month recognition period.
So I'd say that's pretty consistent.
Jonathan one thing I would say which we talked about I think at some length last quarter is that we're in an unprecedented time of public -- private carriers public disclosure around their multiyear plans for CapEx spending.
And historically we've -- given some public comments generally about the next 9 to 12 months and what they're going to do in any given year and you have most of the carriers who've come out with at least 2- to 3-year CapEx plans and what those plans are going to entail in terms of both small cell deployments in macro sites and amendment activity.
And so I think we have we probably have about the same amount of visibility on a quarter-by-quarter basis as we've ever had.
But the one thing that has changed is the longer-term view that the carriers have taken about their network and we're just working through that as we go through the near term.
Our next question comes of the line of Mike McCormick with Nomura Securities.
Research Division</strong> Ben can you just comment on the environment out there.
You guys talked a couple of times I guess about acquisition opportunities.
I think AT&amp;T has been pretty vocal about looking into that.
Is there any change in the carrier behavior on that side? And then secondly do you guys evaluate looking at the DISH-Sprint combination.
What kind of opportunities would that provide for you guys? Sure.
On the acquisition front as Jay mentioned there's always things in the pipeline.
And there's a couple of I'd call them medium-sized things that were looking at.
I think Jay used to -- about 3% of assets that's about right.
We would have effectively fund that out of cash flow.
And so that's why we're looking at maybe holding off a little bit until we know the end of -- the outcome on those.
But in general I'd say the industry if I could editorialize for a minute has gotten pretty comfortable with third-party ownership of independent towers.
And we own as an industry a very significant component of the cell sites in the U.S.
that are made available on a shared basis.
And that model is working very well and is a very cost-effective and efficient way for carriers to occupy their infrastructure.
So look I think that's well established and certainly will continue.
With respect to the DISH and Sprint discussions or Softbank or anyone else that you might hear about on radio or TV seemingly every day that wants access to wireless networks and ultimately consumers.
It's very heartening for us that when we hear about those discussions and it just describes to us or confirms that the fundamental value that's resident in these wireless networks way above and beyond what's evident today.
And so whether you talk about DISH for their obvious business purpose around an augmentation to their satellite TV strategy whether you talk about Softbank or any other technology company that constantly is looking for access to wireless consumers through devices the whole mobile technology wave to us is very exciting and suggests a long-term run here on the need the necessity to access the infrastructure that we own.
And again I keep coming back to this shared model because we think it's a very attractive way to provide infrastructure on a common or a shared basis to these carriers a very efficient way.
And it's not just resident in wireless.
I mean there's a number of other example where that's the case.
So we are very excited about the long-term prospects and there's things out there on the horizon that we don't talk about or certainly don't put in our forecast.
I would include FirstNet in that discussion.
So lots more to come in our expectation.
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
First Jay obviously a very big hike to the AFFO number here.
We've got a few of the piece parts but not everything.
Can you walk us through maybe a bridge to the AFFO increase? Maybe talk through site rental gross margins network services gross margins and then maybe changes in customer prepayments how that all fits together and contributes? And then second question I guess maybe just going back to the acquisition landscape.
When you talk about deals out there that sort of in total are 3% of assets with your leverage backed down to 6.1 turns are you saying these are the assets that are out there and hence that's what you're engaged in or are you saying you still can't engage in bigger deals if there are out there? Because it seems like with the leverage where it is you probably could engage in larger deals.
Sure.
On the increase in outlook we've got about $9 million in the calendar year related to interest savings which I alluded to in my comments when we repriced our Term Loan B.
There's another about $29 million that's related to increases in adjusted EBITDA from where we were previously for the full year.
Then we have the benefit that we talked about from fiber in the first quarter as well as there will likely be some for the balance of the year.
And that basically bridges the balance of the year in terms of the total increase in AFFO.
And Jason I think maybe I would point to just that level of activity in my comments before about construction and where applications go ultimately that will be somewhat of a driver as we get into the balance of the year.
If it's at an elevated level we may do a little bit better from those kind of activity but very difficult for us to predict that at this point.
So most of it is really just adjusted EBITDA growth and that's coming from the outperformance in the current quarter as well as our raise in terms of expectations for site rental revenue that's the driver there for the growth in adjusted EBITDA the interest savings and then really what we already achieved in the first quarter makes up the bulk of it.
On your second question around leverage at 6.1x really my comment for what I was alluding to was if you look at capital spending or share -- and share purchases and acquisitions we didn't send all the cash flow that we earned during the first quarter which has I guess normally been our practice to invest most of it during the quarter.
That 3% represents specific assets -- less than 3% of our total assets.
Those represents specific acquisitions that we're in the process of looking at currently.
No promises that will be successful on those but it's been said we think we can fund those out of cash flow.
And so we were in essence holding on to cash and not making investments waiting for the outcome on those.
I think broadly to the extent that something larger than what is relatively small acquisitions would have come about then that would be a different discussion and we'd have to look at those assets.
This is -- my comments are related to specifically to some specific assets that we were looking at and why we didn't invest all the cash flow that we earned in the quarter.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Great.
If I could follow-up on one other thing that's come up during the call you talked about maybe an ability to pull forward going after a private letter ruling.
Is there -- I guess I'm just not familiar with what sort of expiration or renewal would be required.
How far in advance of actually converting could you actually achieve that and then wait to convert and have that sort of designation still hold? It would be good for a couple of years.
We wouldn't -- that private letter ruling doesn't really doesn't really expire.
Our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> So I guess there's been a lot of hand wringing over the last quarter and I think we addressed a couple of the reasons.
One was concerns that maybe towers were going x growth and I think you guys addressed that with some of the applications demand you're talking about.
Another reason was some of the M&amp;A anxiety about 4 to 3 combinations and I think that is working itself out.
I would say maybe the one last thing that has come up again and again has been subsequent to AT&amp;T's announcement that it was going to do 2 things to expand its network.
One was to expand their macro cell sites accelerating it by about 50% but also introducing 40 000 new small cells.
There's been anxiety about how small cells might be a substitute for the macro cell sites or how as we densify the markets which is going to be in more of the urban areas where towers aren't is the opportunity going to skew away from where the towers are? Probably nobody knows more about that than you guys other than AT&amp;T.
Could you kind of map us or walk us through maybe Ben kind of how the architecture works and whether it's complementary and whether we should be worried about the ultimate substitution nature of that business? David that's a great question.
And obviously we believe and our experiencing the fact that it's complementary and it's really all of the above.
We know from our drive testing precisely which sites existing macro sites could solve existing needs in the marketplace.
And as I've said a few minutes ago one of the things that's been -- we've seen clearly and it makes perfect sense a little bit in hindsight is the carriers' capital and focus has been on amending existing sites for obvious reasons multi thousands of them.
And as we've disclosed I think last year we had 23 000 individual applications inside the company.
I mean that's just a mind-boggling number.
Those are amendments primarily on the first pass of LTE.
That doesn't -- we're not suggesting that they don't need any other macro sites it's just that's the first thing that happened.
Now as you're seeing the next thing that's happening is they're going back and starting to address the obvious sites that would have satisfied additional coverage or capacity requirements with LTE being part of that installation as sort of the second way.
And we believe that will continue.
And we see that happening in macro sites.
We think -- are certainly the most efficient way to cover the capacity challenges and coverage challenges that remain out there today and that will continue.
But that's not sufficient.
There's a lot of places as you point out in your question where small cells can augment in a very small geographic area the capacity that may not be available from the macro site or even the rooftop site.
And so while -- if you're standing there in that location you might actually have 1 or 2 bars of coverage on your phone from the macro site it's not enough to do the mobile technology or the mobile broadband services that the carriers want to provide and that were willing to pay for apparently because that's what's happening.
And so that's why you see the carriers talking about multi-thousand small cells being added as augmentation to add capacity and effectively reuse the spectrum in a micro cell on those if you will and multiply the capacity that's available to the consumer in those in urban areas.
But it's really both.
And I think what's driving this -- what we paid close attention to is the ability for the carriers to continue to make capital investments to add data capacity and densification and drive incremental EBITDA and margin through their wireless businesses.
And from what we can tell that's very evident and that's there today.
And so that's why we -- one of the primary reasons we were so excited about what we see in the U.S.
We as consumers are prepared to and expect to pay for data services and we are doing that.
And there's a lot more devices coming and applications coming.
And as I mentioned earlier technology companies that want access to wireless consumers that I suspect we're all going to be paying for more services in the future and getting more out of it.
But that's basically how it's working.
It's both.
Research Division</strong> Perfect.
And then just -- if I could one last one.
With respect to the different potential combinations out there sorry to put you on the spot but if you could come up with the dream scenario for towers for Crown Castle in particular among the publicly announced transactions that are going out there today.
What would you be rooting for what would you be rooting against? I don't think I'm going to touch that one.
We like where we are.
We like where we are and what we have.
And the carriers obviously have their own business plans and they're working hard to do it.
What we're focused on is making sure that we're the most efficient and cost-effective means for them to deploy their network to consumers and that's what we are.
Our next question comes on the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I wonder if you could talk about a couple of other revenue sources microwave dishes anything on generators in the post-Sandy world you've seen increased demand there.
And coming back to this 60% coming from new colos do you think we've now flipped permanently that we've gone from an amendment dominated to a new colo dominated or is that going to fluctuate around? And I think that was something that a lot of people thought would be more of a 2014 effect so thoughts on that? Sure.
Simon we are seeing some microwaves on sites and that's contributing to the revenue growth we're seeing.
And then in terms of predicting the mix of colos I think to a degree is a function of sort of where we are in the deployment plans or progress with the various carriers on their LTE amendment.
As we've noted and we got out in front of some this pretty early with carriers on our sites and so we've sort of come through the crest if you will on LTE amendment activity.
And so I think the natural then is to come back to the colos.
How we would predict that it continues I mean we can again we can see where there are obvious needs.
It's challenging to predict exactly how they prioritize their capital.
Obviously 4 months into the year now we're very pleased with what we've seen.
I would point out though that in the guidance we were a little conservative.
We didn't necessarily forecast that this level of activity continue the entire year.
So we obviously had great results in the first quarter and we expect that that will pick up that will generate revenue as Jay mentioned in the third and fourth quarter but we're still -- we're going to take this quarter at a time and see how it goes.
Research Division</strong> Anything on generators? A little bit.
That's is a difficult one.
There is still a capital allocation discussion there that happens within each carrier.
We do have obviously generator space.
We've done share generator models in the past for carriers.
It really comes down to a capital prioritization within the carrier.
But we have certainly availability of ground space and the willingness to own and share generators when that becomes the preferred approach.
I mean there's a lot of things going on between battery backup power elevated platforms mobile generators.
And so we'll -- I think there's obviously been appropriate attention on the issue and we stand ready to help where we can.
Our next question comes of the line of Batya Levi with UBS.
Research Division</strong> I think in your guidance that you had provided in the beginning of the year you had not included any Clearwire revenues in it.
Given the new guidance do we -- have you included Clearwire in it now? And also wanted to just clarify the lag periods that you've mentioned the application to recognition of revenues so 4 to 5 months.
When Sprint talks that they're going to deploy LTE on 800 in the fourth quarter would they be starting that process today or could that potentially provide upside throughout the year? Sure.
In your first question with regards to Clearwire we did not put them in the original outlook in terms of expectations for additional leasing from them and we've not included any in this current outlook so no change there.
On the timing generally speaking if a carrier is indicating that a site is going to be on air on a specific date or inside a specific quarter the application would need to come to us 4 to 5 months ahead of that date in order to get them on air on their targeted date.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And maybe just one more.
How should we think about the new construction CapEx this year? And how many new towers do you expect to build? I think the new tower count this quarter was a bit lower than we expected.
Do you expect that to ramp up throughout the year? Most of the new construction CapEx that we're spending is related to small cell network deployment and so I don't think you'll see us build a whole lot of towers this calendar year.
Most of that will be related to spending on the small cell side which we continue to find opportunities for.
If I had to guess where we'll end up at the end of the year it would probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about $150 million on new sites.
As we've talked about though it's a bit of a soft outlook or soft guidance because at the returns we're able to achieve in these building of new sites whether that's small cells or towers we'll do all that we can find.
And so that $150 million is really our best estimate of where the opportunities are currently.
And if more opportunities show up we'd happily invest at a higher level than that.
Our next question comes of the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
What is the current AFFO contribution from DAS if it is positive? And when will this begin to have a significant impact in AFFO growth as you complete some of the initial CapEx? Sure.
It is contributing it is positive to AFFO.
We don't segment reports our small cell business it's right inside of our tower business.
So we try to get some color on some of the trend lines given the amount of capital investment we made last year and ongoing but I'm not going to get into specifically how much it's contributing.
On a growth basis it's making a meaningful difference.
As Ben talked about disproportionate to its size we're seeing a significant amount of activity and leasing associated with that business.
So it's positively impacting AFFO and the flow through down through EBITDA.
Have you seen any increases in tenancy on DAS? What is your average tenants per DAS site and what was that a year ago? Well when you look at the average tenancy it's a mixed bag.
Because what's happening given the number of new networks we're building where we'll have a single tenant or maybe 2 tenants on day 1 it will bring down the overall average tenants per DAS network.
As we look at the older systems that are on there the vintage is exactly what we would expect.
And as we compare that vintage to the legacy of towers we're adding the second and third and fourth tenant at a rate faster than what we've historically been able to do with towers.
And so if you were to track it on a system-by-system basis you'd see a rate of growth on additional tenancy that looks better than what we've seen over the last 15 years in towers.
And that's about 0.125 per year or 1/10 over 8 years on the macro site? Yes.
Yes that would be about right on the macro site and it's tracking higher on that on DAS.
Our next question comes of the line of Michael Rollins Citi Investment Research.
Research Division</strong> Could you just clarify what the internal same tower growth rate was for the quarter? And do you have handy the prepaid rent number for the fourth quarter of 2012? I noticed you gave 1Q '13 1Q '11 -- sorry 1Q '12.
Do you have that 4Q just to compare sequentially that would be helpful? Yes.
On the same tower sales basically that number is in the ballpark of about $150 million of cash and a little over half of that would be the cash escalators and then organic growth would be the rest of that Mike.
And that would be separating out the significant ones that would be affecting that would be related to the T-Mobile acquisition that we did.
If we go back and look at where the net prepaid -- the net straight-line impact was in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter it's pretty similar.
It moves about $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2012 in our favor in terms of higher cash $2 million to $3 million from Q4 into Q1.
Research Division</strong> And so as you look at this then does that imply that straight-line would have actually been higher in 1Q so some of the sequential revenue growth may have been held by straight-line? I'm just trying to get a sense of actual growth rates of the internal tower performance and just trying to understand the different impacts that fiber prepaid rents are now having on the financials? Well if you separated the activity that drive prepaid as I was mentioning the construction activity and we spoke specifically about the fiber activity.
If you were to strip that out Mike completely that number the total number today is the drag on cash of about $135 million.
And that includes the benefit we're getting currently because of the construction activity.
If you were to take that number and forecast it out to 2016 and say that there was no benefit to the company from construction activity so this would be a theoretical environment where there's no leasing activity and no construction activity going on that drag goes from a drag to basically breakeven in 2016.
And the trend line between today and then is a relatively straight line.
And so as the construction activity happens depending on the level of activity there it's going to make that number get closer to breakeven in some period of time shorter than what it otherwise would if there no amount of construction activity.
So I think underlying this and maybe this is helpful just to back up a step from a cash standpoint looking at the $2.2 billion of cash revenue that we have the average escalator there is just a hair under 4%.
And so there's about $80 million a year of cash growth just coming from existing base of business.
And that's going to happen on a relatively straight-line basis from now through the average term of the leases remaining which is about 9 years 8 to 9 years remaining.
And so we'll see that cash growth flow through and that will drive down that straight-line revenue number.
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A question for you with regard to what you're seeing in trends for the 4G LTE builds in 2013 versus 2014.
We had heard that there might be a little bit of a push out from '13 into '14 not a decrease but a push out that seems to be maybe going against what I'm hearing from you guys.
But I'd like to hear your color on that.
Yes.
No I wouldn't agree with that.
We're not seeing a push out.
We're seeing a lot of work happen again that we are -- we've been on this amendment work for the last 2 years in a very big way.
And so I would venture to guess speculate with you that in 2013 we'll do less LTE amendments than we did last year only because we're sort of getting through the halfway point of our overall portfolio and more as we've talked about several times significantly more co-location than we did last year.
So as it relates to Crown's portfolio obviously the only one we could speak to I'd say we're probably pass the halfway point in aggregate between all 4 carriers combined.
I'd say we're probably this is unscientific but we're probably right about halfway.
And it's certainly not slowing down.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then one follow-up on the small cells.
If there's a small cell deployment that's not on one of your towers or not on one of your sites is there any way that at carrier can go in and negotiate a building right themselves or would they still be doing it through you? Well let's sort of go back through that.
Obviously if the tower is our tower we'll negotiate with ourselves.
If it's a small cell we'll have fiber in an area.
So if it's a -- let's just take an outdoor situation where we have fiber there's nothing technically precluding them from laying their own fiber but that would be very cost inefficient relative to ourselves.
We already have a shared model there and so the neutral host model just as in the towers is alive and well and working in our favor and making it more efficient for the carrier to operate on a small cell they would add to an existing network.
And with respect to a building the general rule is on a building we have an exclusive right.
If we're in a public venue or stadium or basketball arena or something like that then it's an exclusive right in partnership with the building owner or the municipality where we're on a typically a revenue share basis and they have to work through Crown.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And one last thing as far as the small cells.
We've been hearing a lot about I guess multiband small cells.
How important do you think it is and how far along are the equipment providers with regard to that? And what type of impact do you think that could have positively or negatively? I think certainly positive.
I mean the  opportunity to add additional capacity in the small cell is essentially what we're doing.
There's a physical constraint sometimes on each individual pole so you have to go next pole over if you're on an outside DAS system just on based on zoning and just the physical limitation.
But combining multiband is already happening.
And in some cases that's actually -- when we think of the vernacular of tenant we try to get keep it simple.
The tenants oftentimes in small cells is additional bands additional slots in the box.
And that's additional revenue.
Our next question comes of the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
LLC Research Division</strong> Great.
I actually just want to talk about interest rates.
I think one of the things that we've been hearing from investors certainly through the course of this year is the concern that with rising interest rates it could be negative for the tower providers particularly as it relates to M&amp;A.
And I was wondering if you could just share with us what you've seen as it relates to interest rates with the potential debt insurance that you look at to finance some of your transactions as what's happened with interest rates pushed you to do one type of instrument versus another one perhaps CMBS? And if you can just give us a little bit of color there to help us get a little bit more comfortable on the ability to contain and pay the multiples that you are paying and still have these transactions be accretive? Sure.
I think the first point I would make is the comment that I made during the prepared remarks.
If you look at the current balance sheet we've got about 7 years -- almost 7 years remaining on the average term and the average coupon is about 4.5%.
That mix of our current debt is about 70% fixed rate and about 30% floating rate.
So over the next 6.5 to 7 years the exposure that we have to near-term rates is about 30% of our overall mix.
We have seen over a long period time obviously in the business those interest rates fluctuate.
And the cost of debt fluctuates.
And when it does the cost of -- and our willingness to buy assets can fluctuate as well.
Today in the market we could be an issuer of long-term debt senior debt at the parent company somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% to 5.5% and so the debt is still attractive.
And as you pointed out we've looked at other opportunities where we've gone down at the asset level and limited the amount of leverage that we put down there to achieve an investment-grade credit rating.
And have found very attractive fixed rates on debt that we can do for long periods of time.
And so it's more than a single-pronged question it relates both to what's the cost of debt and then based on that we can adjust our willingness to buy assets at.
And so over time we think we've got a pretty good structure in terms of flexibility around where we can finance the assets whether at the asset level or up at the parent level.
And to the extent that we pursue acquisitions again it's relative to our other alternative which is buying back our own stock.
And that's proven to be a very attractive investment over a long period of time.
I think with that we'll wrap it up.
And again I appreciate everybody's attention this morning and joining us on the call.
We are very pleased with how the year has started off.
And we look forward to visiting with you on the next quarter call.
Thank you very much.

Welcome to the Crown Castle International Q2 2013 Earnings Call.
[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today July 25 2013.
I will now turn the conference over to Fiona McKone VP of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations.
Please go ahead ma'am.
Thanks Angel.
Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us as we review our second quarter 2013 results.
With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.
To aid the discussion we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com which we will discuss throughout the call this morning.
This conference call will contain forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations.
Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable it can give no assurances that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions.
Information about the potential factors that could affect the company's financial results is available in the press release and in the Risk Factors sections of the company's filings with the SEC.
Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual results may vary significantly from those expected.
Our statements are made as of today July 25 2013 and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise.
In addition today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA funds from operations funds from operations per share adjusted funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations per share.
Tables reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures are available under the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.
With that I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
Let me start with a few summary comments as outlined on Slide 3 and then I'll go through our results and outlook in greater detail.
As you've seen from our press release we had an excellent second quarter exceeding the high end of our previously-issued guidance for site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA AFFO and AFFO per share.
We continue to make good progress integrating the T-Mobile towers and are substantially complete with the integration of the said [ph] acquisition.
The strong year-to-date results and our expectations for the second half of the year allow us to meaningfully increase our 2013 outlook for site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
Turning to Slide 4.
During the second quarter we generated site rental revenue of $617 million up 19% from the second quarter of 2012.
Site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues less the cost of operations was $438 million up 13% from the second quarter of 2012.
Further our network services significantly exceeded our expectations contributing $48 million in gross margin compared to the $28 million in the second quarter of 2012 reflecting the continued level of network upgrade activity in the market.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2013 was $444 million up 17% from the second quarter of 2012.
AFFO was $304 million up 41% from the second quarter of 2012 and adjusted funds from operations per share was $1.04 up 41% from the second quarter of 2012.
We significantly exceeded AFFO in the second quarter compared to our outlook issued in April 2013 primarily due to approximately $12 million more contributions from services than expected approximately $2 million of nonrecurring items in site rental revenue and higher-than-expected contributions related to reimbursements for wireless infrastructure expenditures necessary to accommodate carrier equipment which is directly related to the increase in leasing activity which I will elaborate upon in a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 5.
During the second quarter we invested $228 million in activities related to our core business.
We spent $138 million on capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $27 million on our land lease purchase program.
Since we began this important effort we have completed over 14 000 individual land transactions.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 77% of our gross margin.
We believe this activity is a core competency of Crown Castle and we continue to enjoy significant success with this program as evidenced by the fact that today 36% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own up from less than 15% in January of 2007.
Further the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 33 years.
We continue to focus a significant amount of effort and capital on purchasing land beneath our towers and extending our ground leases.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we spent $10 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $101 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures.
Our revenue-generating capital expenditures consisted of $66 million on existing sites and $35 million on the construction of new sites primarily the construction of small-cell networks.
Additionally we spent $15 million on acquisitions during the second quarter.
Also during the second quarter we purchased approximately 1.1 million of our common shares for $75 million or at an average price of approximately $70 per share.
Since 2003 we have spent $2.8 billion to purchase approximately 102 million of our common shares and potential shares at an average price of $27.45 per share.
Without this significant investment in our shares our existing share count would be more than 1/3 higher our current shares outstanding.
Importantly during the same period of time we have more than tripled the size of our tower portfolio and developed a significant number of small-cell networks.
Additionally during the second quarter we refinanced the existing $1.58 billion Term Loan B and effectively lowered the rate on the loan by 75 basis points saving approximately $12 million in annual interest expense.
We ended the second quarter of 2013 with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6x down from approximately 6.3x at the time of the T-Mobile tower acquisition in November of 2012.
As of June adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense was 3.7x.
Moving to the outlook for full year 2013 on Slide 6.
We have meaningfully increased full year 2013 outlook from what we provided in April increasing adjusted EBITDA by $28 million and AFFO by $61 million primarily based on our year-to-date results.
I'm delighted with the performance of our business and our increased expectations for the balance of 2013.
We now expect 2013 year-over-year site rental revenue growth of 17% adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and AFFO per share growth of 34%.
We expect to augment our AFFO growth through opportunistic investments and activities such as share repurchases tower acquisitions new site construction and land purchases.
Consistent with our past practice our outlook does not include the benefit from these expected investments.
As we noted in the press release based on currency movements we decreased our expected contribution from our Australian operations for full year 2013 outlook by approximately $8 million for site rental revenue and by $6 million for adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
As shown on Slide 7 for 2013 we expect to generate approximately $1.2 billion of AFFO and invest approximately $500 million on capital expenditures related to the purchases of land beneath our towers the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites including small-cell networks.
Ignoring our borrowing capacity the portion of our AFFO after expected capital expenditures represents $175 million per quarter of cash flow that we could invest in activities related to our core business including share repurchases tower acquisitions new site constructions and land purchases.
As such we remain focused on investing our cash in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.
I believe that this level of capital investments can add between 3% and 5% to our organic AFFO per share growth rate on an annual basis.
In summary we had an excellent second quarter as we continued to execute around our core business and we're very excited about the balance of 2013.
Additionally during the second quarter we stepped up our preparations for our anticipated future REIT conversion and have engaged accounting and legal advisors to assist us in this effort.
Currently we have approximately $2.7 billion of net operating losses and I expect we'll convert to a REIT no later than the exhaustion of these NOLs.
Based on our internal models I believe we'll consume the entirety of our NOLs by late 2016 or early 2017.
Before I turn the call over to Ben I would like provide some additional color on prepaid rent which has been a popular topic of discussion with investors since our first quarter earnings.
In our press release yesterday we provided additional disclosure regarding prepaid rent related to our site rental revenues which details the amount of prepaid rent and amortization included in AFFO.
By way of example on Slide 8 we show a single lease we added this quarter to a tower just north of Phoenix Arizona and the associated prepaid rent we received in connection with the addition of this tenant to our tower.
Our tenant leases typically have 2 rental components: a monthly rent and a prepaid rent.
The prepaid rent reflects a carrier's contribution towards the capital expenditure necessary to modify the tower to accommodate the additional carrier equipment associated with the new lease.
This contribution can either be made as prepaid rent or incorporated into the recurring monthly rent we receive from the carrier.
Since the very early days of our business our customers have contributed to the required tower modification as they install additional equipment on our towers.
We would expect this pricing construct to continue as long as carriers are adding equipment to our towers.
Consistent with GAAP accounting standards both rental components regardless of when cash payments are received are straight-lined over the term of the lease as reflected on Slide 8 and shown in the GAAP revenue line on the graph.
As the chart indicates in this example the GAAP revenue shown by the orange line is flat for each of the years over the 10-year term of the lease and is calculated as the average of the prepaid rent and all contracted future rent payments.
The cash received shown by the blue bars reflects the prepaid rent in year 1 along with the monthly rent payments with contracted escalators in future years.
As such our AFFO metric reflects the impact of the cash bar shown on the chart while our adjusted EBITDA metric reflects the impact of the solid line on the graph.
Moving back to a high level on Slide 9.
As you can see from our press release our current amount of site rental revenues on a GAAP basis are greater than the cash amounts we are currently receiving for site rental revenues inclusive of prepaid rent.
As we have shown in the past we have graphed all of our existing tenant leases for years 2013 through 2022 showing the expected reported amounts for GAAP purposes and their respective cash receipts.
Similar to the single lease example we have shown we expected GAAP site rental revenue as a solid line and the expected cash receipts as bars.
As you can see from the graph we expect that beginning in about 2017 our cash receipts from tenant leases will exceed the amount of reported site rental revenue.
This is as you would expect given the average life of the leases across the entire portfolio currently approximately 8 years suggesting the crossover should be in approximately 4 years or 2017 as the graph illustrates.
I should note that the graph only shows existing contracted revenue stream and prepaid rent is not included in this analysis for years 2014 and beyond as it is associated with new leasing activities.
However prepaid rent could accelerate the timing of when cash receipts will actually exceed reported site rental revenue as illustrated by the impact of prepaid rent in 2013.
We continue to think it is helpful to include prepaid rent in our AFFO metric as we believe that it helps investors understand the timing of the cash generated by our business.
The nominal amount of prepaid rent has increased over the last couple of years as we have significantly increased the number of assets that we own and we have seen a meaningful increase in leasing activities both from new leases and amendments to existing leases.
In 2013 our outlook suggests that prepaid rent net of amortization will be approximately 9% of our 2013 AFFO which is the same percentage of contribution we saw in 2012.
I hope you find this additional disclosure and extended explanation helpful.
Back to the big picture and in summary we had a terrific second quarter and I'm very excited about the balance of 2013 as we continue to execute around our core business and make investments we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.
And with that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.
Thank you Jay and thanks again to everybody joining us on the call.
As Jay just mentioned we had an excellent second quarter exceeding our outlook for site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
And we are excited about our business as we look to the balance of the year.
As you know there's a significant amount of activity in our industry currently as all 4 major U.S.
wireless carriers are engaged in major network upgrades simultaneously and we're enjoying a significant ramping of leasing activity as reflected in our increased 2013 guidance.
As we've noted in the press release we saw new revenue from tenant additions almost double in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012.
In fact an important component of these new tenant additions first time installs or co-locations are up 2.5x for the first half of 2013 compared to the first half of 2012 reflecting the shift in activity towards inflow sites.
This densification activity is the expected second wave of the LTE network deployment and provides us with a longer runway of expected future growth as carriers strive to improve network quality and to add capacity through cell splitting in the face of continued growth in mobile technology demand.
Given the urban concentration of our sites there's 74% of our sites in the top 100 markets where we expect the majority of network densification to occur.
We are very excited about our prospects as this next wave of leasing materializes.
From a macro perspective the trends underlying the phenomenal growth in wireless data continue unabated and carrier capital spending plans reflect that reality.
In the first quarter of 2013 U.S.
mobile data revenues grew 14% year-over-year to reach $21 billion and are expected to reach $90 billion for the full year 2013.
Recent carrier contract terms that bring forward the ability of consumers to switch handsets earlier is expected to result in even faster adoption of the newest smartphones and other connected devices which typically offer greater breadth of applications and faster connectivity leading to even more consumption of data.
Research from Google shows that smartphones continue to drive consumers' wireless purchases with 35% of respondents in a new survey saying that they purchased their phone to obtain the latest and greatest device up from 25% last year.
Smartphone adoption continues to fuel the growth in mobile data with mobile data consumption at some operators averaging over 1 gigabyte per month already bumping up against established data tiers with some devices averaging close to 2 to 3 gigabytes per month.
In fact in Verizon's recent results they noted that 33% of their postpaid subscriber base is on their LTE network and already consumes 59% of their total data traffic.
As CTIA recently reported for the last 6 months of 2012 data traffic was up 59% and for the full year 2012 data traffic was up 69% compared to 2011.
And Cisco continues to estimate that U.S.
mobile data traffic will grow nine-fold from 2012 to 2017.
Further the expanding LTE networks are expected to accelerate the growth of computing devices including smartphones and tablets over the next several years as well as countless machine-to-machine applications including connected automobiles.
Increasing wireless capacity and broadband speeds driving more data usage and applications built for a mobile environment is a continuing reality.
Before I turn the call over for questions I want to spend just a minute on LTE and where we think we are in the cycle.
To help provide a framework for LTE build-out and our expectations for the longer runway of growth that we see it is useful to compare how 4G LTE subscriptions are trending versus 3G subscriptions in the early days of that technology's rollout.
For the initial 8 quarters beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010 through the third quarter of 2012 LTE subscriptions significantly outpaced the initial 8 quarters of 3G which began in the first quarter of 2003 both in terms of growth rate and absolute numbers.
Estimates are that total LTE subscribers could exceed 180 million by the end of this year and 260 million by 200 -- 2017 with the total number of LTE customers representing 70% of all U.S.
mobile subscriptions by 2017.
Further as each of the carriers have discussed publicly the process of building LTE coverage and capacity is a multiyear commitment.
We are very pleased to be playing an integral part in each of the big 4 U.S.
carriers' LTE deployment plans and network densification needs for the long term.
We have a unique portfolio of sites and capabilities that we are bringing to bear every day to assist carriers in realizing their plans.
Further the network densification needs of the carriers will be accomplished by both macro cells and small cells.
Indeed small cells are an integral part of the LTE operators' network strategy.
As the leader in small-cell networks we are seeing tremendous growth in this part of our business with organic leasing growth on small cells tracking well above our expectations.
And we're excited to be investing for growth in this area.
While small cells represent a small percentage of our overall site rental revenue we expect and are seeing growth from small cells contribute significantly more than their relative size as we've talked about on previous calls.
So to wrap up our strategy remains unchanged.
We're the largest wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S.
with an urban-centric portfolio where leasing activity and demand for mobile technology is the highest.
We remain focused on the U.S.
market the largest and fastest-growing wireless market in the world where the ability of the wireless carriers to make profitable investments is most apparent and barriers to entry remain high.
As consistently demonstrated in our results we believe our well-located tower portfolio and the ability to execute for customers allows us to drive the opportunity in the U.S.
market.
Leveraging our experienced management team customer relationships and services offerings across our unrivaled tower footprint together with our leadership in small-cell networks positions us to be the provider of choice as carriers continue to enhance their network to meet ever-increasing wireless demand.
We believe providing carriers with access to our 30 000 sites extensive small cells and fiber resources through a shared infrastructure model remains the most efficient means of delivering mobile technology to consumers.
I'm excited about the significant growth we are experiencing in our business and how we are positioned for the runway of growth we anticipate in the future.
So in closing we had an excellent second quarter and look forward to the balance of the year and beyond.
And with that operator we're pleased to turn the call over for questions.
[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Mr.
Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> I was interested in the small cell aspect of the business.
And as you expand that platform how much of that is leveraging your existing fiber footprint versus requiring the additional expansion not just of fiber laterals but the fiber backbone itself? And then secondly I was interested in the T-Mobile Metro PCS integration and what you're seeing on that in your -- on your tower asset.
Sure Jon.
Thanks for the question.
On the small cell side we're seeing a significant uptake in co-location if you will on existing fiber plant and networks through systems that we have.
As we've talked about before it's a long runway to build new.
We are working on that and actively engaged in a very significant build effort to add additional capacity and additional networks.
But a very significant component of what we're seeing is as we would affectionately call it in the tower business co-location.
It's not quite that simple in small cells because it can either be in that same box or it can be next pullover [ph] as we've talked about and demonstrated with many of you in the past.
But the financial reality is the same.
And so we're seeing a very significant amount of co-locations on the small-cell networks and are very excited about what we see there.
Again having that plant if you will of embedded fiber in the networks up and running is very key to being able to deliver really any kind of speed to market to satisfy a need for a customer in an urban area so that's proving to be very valuable.
Next with respect to T-Mobile and Metro PCS I think they're just beginning to sort of get their heads around what they have.
We certainly anticipate on the small-cell side that's continuing upgrading for the different additional frequencies that are required there.
But we expect that's going to continue as it has in the past with additional opportunity on the T-Mobile side.
On the tower side I think we've disclosed -- Jay we've gone through sort of what the overlap is.
You might want to refresh everybody on that.
Total exposure to Metro is about 4% of our consolidated revenues and the overlap is somewhere in the neighborhood of about 3%.
And term remaining we still have several years on those leases.
So as Ben mentioned Jon it's probably too early for us to have any view as to do we see them renew the equipment in the overlap site.
We'll just -- we'll have to see how it goes.
But at least Jon you have the bookends then you can model it as you think appropriate.
And given the term of those remaining Metro leases and the pace at which we're adding equipment and additional RAD centers on occasion for carriers we'll just have to wait and see what that ultimately looks like when we get to the end of those leases.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay.
Finally as Sprint starts to wrap its arms around the 2.5 frequencies from Clearwire and then build that out can you remind us given the natural [indiscernible] that you have in place to what extent that triggers extra revenue for you? With the 2.5 it depends on what's up on the site.
But generally I would say it's a relatively minor revenue event given their Network Vision equipment and the compatibility of that spectrum built in.
Again we think it is some incremental but probably not of the magnitude you'd see on a typical amendment cycle because that equipment is compatible with that 2.5 already.
We do expect we'll see that the Clearwire sites that are built for LTE that there were some coordination there with Sprint as you would expect.
We anticipate that those sites continue.
And then again the overlap sites we'll have to see over time how that plays out when we reach the natural end of the Clearwire licenses.
I believe that's again about 1% of overlap in the company.
And your next question comes from the line of Mr.
Simon Flannery.
Research Division</strong> Just continuing on the Sprint situation I think you'd said in the past you expected about 3% of the impact from the iDEN decommissioning next year.
Have you had any sort of further color from Sprint as certainly the network is a big focus? Or are you -- they going to take those sites down might they repurpose them or might it be delayed? And secondly Jay on the REIT conversion.
You talked in the past about leverage.
Your leverage is down to 6x.
Do you still want to get that down to around 5x before you convert? Sure on the first question the exposure that we currently have to iDEN is -- makes up approximately 3% of revenues which we think is the bookend impact of the agreement that we struck with Sprint several years ago.
They have the ability over calendar years 2014 and 2015 to remove that on a ratable basis.
And we -- at this stage we don't really have perfect clarity on what they're going to do there.
They may decide ultimately to renew some of those installations or they may decide to remove the equipment as they have the contractual right to do.
And I think we'll have to get into those years to really understand where it's going to come out.
But that's -- that could be the impact over the next 2 years on a consolidated basis.
With regards to REIT conversion as we did note in the press release and I alluded to in my comments we certainly stepped up the amount of effort that we've made on that front and we're working diligently towards taking the steps that will be necessary for us to make the REIT conversion over the next couple of years.
And with regards to how we think about that relative to leverage I think we've been pretty clear in the past that we think there's value in being at the corporate level an investment-grade rated credit.
We think that gives us access to capital and ultimately has a positive benefit on the cost of equity.
So I wouldn't describe it as necessarily a bright line or something that we have to do or need to do prior to REIT conversion.
And I think longer term we think it's appropriate and helpful to the cost of equity to bring that down if we achieve that investment-grade credit rating.
So I think it could be something where we get there prior to REIT conversion.
It could be also something that as we're converting into a REIT we have a plan of deleveraging to get down to that level.
Now I -- whenever we talk about this subject about target level of leverage and how we deploy leverage it's always I think a bit of a relative measure against what are the opportunities in front of us and what is the cost of the debt.
We obviously went above -- our long-term targeted level of leverage has been 4 to 6x for a number of years.
We went above that level in order to acquire the T-Mobile assets but that was the right decision.
We were able to acquire another 7 000 towers and didn't issue any shares associated with that acquisition.
We're able to do it with a very low cost of debt and long-dated maturities on the debt.
And so I would say it's a target for us but it's always relative to what is the opportunity.
And historically we've used our leverage capacity to both buy assets and to buy stock based on what the prices of our stock and assets were as well as managing the balance sheet.
So it's -- I wouldn't draw any bright lines but I think the targeted range is where you have seen us operate and probably in the years forward as we convert to a REIT it moves us towards the lower end of the range so that we are able to accomplish getting an investment-grade credit rating.
Your next question comes from the line of Mr.
David Barden.
Research Division</strong> I guess 2.
So first Jay obviously I think that there's a lot of excitement about what's going on in the wireless industry.
There's a lot of energy going on into network builds.
And I think the stock price today is reacting a little bit to a sense that there's a lack of that energy being realized on Crown's part in the revenue -- at the site rental revenue numbers.
Kind of hitting the midpoint of the guidance is good but it doesn't seem to necessarily reflect how much activity there is going on in the market.
I guess taking out one-timers first quarter was $611.4 million 2Q was $614.8 million so that's only $3.5 million.
But then as I look at the end of the year you've got -- doing the math on your full year guidance you're looking at something like $11 million or $12 million of sequential revenue growth in 4Q.
So can you kind of map out a little bit for us what's happening in these numbers why the growth looks anemic now and kind of really ramps up in the back part of the year? And then the second part is kind of following up on the leverage and the capacity question.
There is a sense that there are several big deals to be done not just overseas but also domestically potentially AT&amp;T as well as maybe some large private companies.
What is your capacity to do a deal size-wise right now and your comfort level on leverage? Sure.
Dave thanks for the questions.
On the first question about sequential growth I think it's pretty typical in our industry to see activity during the course of the year ramp and that's certainly the case as we look at our 2013 expectations.
We are seeing more leasing activity in the second quarter than what we saw in the first quarter and expect more activity in the back half of the year than what we saw in the first half of the year.
So it's a term that's thrown around a lot in our industry that the year has become back-end loaded with regards to sequential growth.
And it's certainly a period as you've pointed out from the numbers that that's going to be the case again this year.
The GAAP numbers and you've adjusted them as you talked about them but certainly as you look at our sequential growth you have to adjust for the FX I think to get to normalized growth which you did in your comments.
And I think you can see in the back half of the year the growth that we've been talking about both in terms of leasing activity and applications and new installations that are going on the towers.
So I think you've correctly identified it and it's a function of how the carriers deploy their network in the early part of the year both their budgets and what they're planning on doing in the year and then you'd see more activity in the back half of the year than maybe in the first half of the year.
And so sequential growth in revenues and EBITDA follow that trend line.
Let me just -- before I get to your second question the -- also if you recall on the first quarter call we talked about new revenue leasing picking up dramatically over last year.
That is continuing to happen as we've mentioned in our comments but that really started from January.
And so really it's a ramping effect that you see throughout the year.
And based on our pipeline we put out the guidance that we did which implies significant growth.
David you mentioned about some acquisitions and basically what I would say on the acquisition front is just as we've always done we are constantly evaluating from a capital allocation perspective the ability to acquire assets and provide additional growth in AFFO per share against buying our own shares.
And so it's always a relative tradeoff.
And as you've seen over time as Jay mentioned in his comments we've taken 1/3 of the share count out of the company in the last few years.
At the same time we've tripled the size of the portfolio.
So we're very comfortable doing both.
But we will look very carefully at what maximizes long-term growth rates and act accordingly.
And that's how we've acted for a number of years and certainly would expect that's how we'll act going forward.
And your next question comes from the line of Mr.
Rick Prentiss from Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just one quick follow-up on the REIT topic.
You mentioned how in earnest it's been stepping up the pace.
As you think about paying a dividend and converting to a REIT any thoughts on when the accumulated earnings and profitability would have to be paid out or possibly paying a dividend before turning into a REIT? I would separate the REIT conversion from the capital allocation decision around whether we pay dividends or buy back stock.
And so I think as we talk about it you should view our comments as those are 2 separate decisions that we would make.
On the REIT conversion and how we think about it I would anticipate -- when we talk about converting about exhausting the net operating losses in late 2016 or early 2017 I would expect that we'll convert to a REIT prior to accumulating a significant amount of operating or taxable income that we would need to distribute upon conversion.
And so I don't think there will be a date upon which we're making a significant payout of accumulated earning in order to convert to a REIT.
On the second part of the question around capital allocation and paying a dividend we could certainly do that as a C Corp today.
We have -- as you know Rick had a lot of conversations about this and talked a lot about it.
When you look at the growth rates achieved in this business and I think no matter how you want to look at cash flow metric on a per-share basis our business is growing at about 30% year-over-year.
And we think buying back the shares is a phenomenal investment relative to the alternatives.
And so we have continued to stay on that and have done it for a number of years consistently.
And I think at this point we think that's the best path to go.
But there will come a day when we're paying a dividend and ultimately be in a REIT structure and we'll look forward to that day as well.
And between now and any time when we do pay a dividend the aim is to get cash flow per share as high as we possibly can to maximize what that dividend will be.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And the second question is on Slide 9 of the presentation where you showed kind of existing U.S.
tenant leases.
Your guidance I think for leasing revenue for this year is around $2.475 billion.
Looking at that slide the expected reported revenue from existing tenant leases obviously they're not full scale there looks to be noticeably lower than that.
Is that kind of tying back to David's question about are we expecting some ramp-up in the second half of the year? And then also looking into 2014 and '15 just trying to think through what that graph is showing us.
Sure.
We're showing you just our U.S.
business because the vast majority of prepaid rent comes from our U.S.
business.
And so the numbers that are shown there would be our U.S.
tenant leases.
If you were to include Australia then it would match up to our consolidated numbers and obviously be considerably higher.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> That makes sense.
And then one follow-up on Jonathan's question.
On the Sprint Softbank Clearwire item if Softbank does do the $8 billion spending a year at Sprint this year and does another $8 billion next year it's sounds like they want to deploy a lot more 2.5 gigahertz sites.
Then in your answer to the previous question are you assuming that you will not get much benefits to that? Or was that a different answer? No no that's a different answer.
I mean I'm talking about if they go back to the Network Vision overlay and add 2.5 many of those sites configured for that today so that would not be a significant revenue event.
I like you continue to expect that they are going to continue to add capacity and build that network to compete.
And so we would fully expect -- in our comments around network densification you're going to see Sprint right in there with everybody else adding additional sites that they're not previously on.
And so this runway we talked about extended future growth around co-location absolutely extends to Sprint and our expectations for what that brings in the future.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right.
That's beyond the terms of the existing MLA.
That's [indiscernible] nice revenue too.
So if they do start spending that significant CapEx the lag time is maybe late this year but more likely some nice benefit in '14? Yes.
In fact you mentioned our presold agreements.
If you -- as we look at this year versus last year and current run rates we were down by about half on the amount of new applications that are attributed to existing presold MLAs.
So that is tailing off as we would expect as we reach the end of those sort of initial LTE overlays.
And then the new revenue items whether it be a new co-lo or an amendment on a site that's outside the scope of those MLAs those are ramping dramatically and those are what we talked about doubling year-over-year.
So that mix is changing in a very material way in our company such that the overall activity is up as well.
But certainly from a revenue side the new revenue items both co-los and amendments outside the scope of the existing presold MLAs are ramping very significantly.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I think it's a key point for the market to understand as far as what you're seeing in your guidance revenue versus what could be coming shortly.
Right right.
And the next question comes from the line of Mr.
Brett Feldman from Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> I was hoping we can maybe just dial in a bit to where you see the highest potential returns on the use of your cash right now.
And there are 2 things I'm interested in getting a little more color on.
The first is you've talked a lot about network densification and so I'm wondering whether you're seeing a renewed opportunity to increase the rate at which you develop new towers to take advantage of that because historically you've generated your highest returns off of new tower development.
And then secondarily your stock obviously has underperformed in the market.
Are you thinking that maybe now is the time to step on the gas with buybacks? Yes Brett let me take a crack at that.
With the co-location activity in the market that we're talking about and the expected multiyear runway that we think that entails for all 4 major carriers in the U.S.
building towers is certainly something we are revisiting.
We have really come out of that business in a significant way over the last 3 years for obvious reasons because most of the activity borderlining on all of the activity has been around amendments around LTE.
I would tell you that it's certainly on the table.
It's something we're looking at.
I would not be surprised if we even see us building some sites in the U.S.
in the future again to capture that new co-location densification we see going forward.
Other than that high-returning activities we're quite pleased with our stock purchases over the years.
We think we've done extremely well on obviously evaluating the growth opportunity in the business discounting that against the market view and then acting accordingly.
But at the same time we are constantly looking at acquisitions and opportunities to grow the business because we are still very bullish on the long-term growth aspects of our current assets and many that we could potentially acquire.
That was true with NextG in the small-cell business.
And we have been very pleased with what we've seen to date tracking originally -- above our original business plan.
Co-location activity on an existing asset whether it be a small-cell network or the towers is obviously probably the highest-returning activity there is in the industry.
And we are very gratified to see that happening on the small-cell side as well as towers as we've talked about.
So it's really going to be more the same.
We are constantly running sort of a dynamic comparison around where are we currently valued based on our best estimates for our own future growth against other assets maybe in the marketplace.
And we expect to act accordingly and we expect to do that in size given the fact that we're generating as Jay alluded to about $700 million of excess cash flow beyond what I would call sort of normal CapEx that we're doing on land purchases and tower augmentations and small-cell builds as we mentioned.
So we've got a lot of money to put to work.
And as you can tell that's a very significant component of our overall growth over time.
And back to Rick's question I certainly don't want to trade that flexibility to be opportunistic for a dividend prematurely.
There's certainly a time coming when we'll pay a very significant dividend we expect based on the lack of tax shield because the depreciation will be exhausted.
And so that's just the reality.
But in this interim period as Jay was alluding to I think we have an opportunity to grow AFFO per share either through shrinking the denominator or adding to the numerator and we're going to continue to focus on that.
Your next question comes from the line of Amir of Barclays.
Research Division</strong> One of the topics that you folks have mentioned that you're benefiting from right now is this sort of network densification.
As you're building out sort of additional capacity to support traffic for carriers I was wondering if you could highlight sort of the tradeoff with the small-cell choice versus sort of cell splitting or augmenting the macro network.
It seems as though there's a bit of debate going on in the industry as to whether or not small-cell capacity would offset some of the macro cell capacity.
And I was wondering if you could give us some color with your experience on what you're seeing in the market today.
Yes the vast majority of what we're seeing around the small-cell augmentation or densification that's happening where small-cell networks are so co-location as we've referred to it on a small-cell basis is occurring in places where macro sites really are too large or unavailable.
So your -- the purpose is to repurpose the spectrum in a smaller cell if you will in an urban environment where the usage patterns are very very significant and capacity is continuing to be challenged.
Where there's an existing small-cell network available that's a very efficient way to add it and continue to get the maximum resource out of that spectrum because you're reusing it in very small cells if you will.
In many places though where that's the need there is not a small-cell network available.
And absolutely adding additional sites if it's an urban setting potentially a rooftop or adding to macro sites is a preferred approach.
It's the quickest approach.
But Amir it's really both.
I mean it really depends on what the availability of the infrastructure is in the locations there.
And small cells while we've got a nice business that's growing it's still very small relative to the overall geography that the carriers are trying to deal with.
And so the macro sites in terms of bang for the buck it's always more efficient to split a macro site.
But I appreciate that in an urban setting often that's not a choice or those sites are in fact too big and they need to reuse that spectrum in a smaller cell which is in fact what we ultimately do with a small-cell deployment.
So it's really both.
And I certainly wouldn't suggest one is cannibalizing the other.
It's frankly 2 separate issues and 2 tools that they're using to add capacity to the networks.
Research Division</strong> And so just a follow-up there.
I mean it does sound like based on what you're seeing in the marketplace that not only is one not cannibalizing the other but really this is much more of an incremental opportunity for both you folks and for the carriers to extend their capacity.
Exactly.
And again what's most important is having that existing asset available whether it be a tower portfolio well-located in markets where that growth is needed where that capacity enhancement is needed or having embedded fiber with an existing network where you can relatively easily add an additional tenant across that existing fiber plant.
So the major thing we bring is obviously the assets the portfolios where they need them and the ability to execute for customers on a timely basis.
And that's in fact what we're seeing this year significantly ramping.
You could -- and the last thing I'd say is you can certainly see that -- I know most of you listen to our carrier customers' earnings calls and you can certainly hear that in their tone as well.
And your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> I guess first maybe this was addressed but I don't think it was.
Can you talk about what the sort of gross prepaid rent was the last few years? Is 2013 really out of line? Or is this just a little bit bigger than normal? Sure.
It grew meaningfully in 2012 and it's grown to a lesser extent from '12 to '13 as the activity that we've been talking about both in terms of amendment activity for LTE and then as new leasing has begun to pick up.
It's been a part of the business as I mentioned in my comments since the beginning.
So if you go back and look well back into history and you were to adjust for the number of towers that we own and then the leasing activity what you would see is a graph that ebbs and flows.
In some years it's higher in some years it's lower related to what leasing activity is going on.
And so any period of time like what we've been in where there's an increase in activity you're going to see that prepaid rent number increase.
Research Division</strong> And as we think about the driver of that is it more just activity overall or do new tenants sort of drive a higher level of prepaid rents than amendments? Well it would be a combination of both.
Typically speaking if there's new leases going on the tower there is going to be more equipment and therefore the structure is going to need -- likely to have greater reinforcing.
So I think generally speaking you're going to have higher prepaid amounts on new leasing activities so that would certainly factor into it.
The other thing if you're doing a comparison to history that would also be true.
We talked about the fact that about 75% of the prepaid rent activity is related to towers and 25% is related to small cell.
So if we've been building the small-cell business that wouldn't have been there.
If you look back and look at it say you were trying to compare it to another high period of activity in the mid-2000s 2005 2006 that activity wouldn't have been there.
So that would have been another reason why it would be higher today than what it would have been if you're looking back 4 or 5 years ago.
Research Division</strong> And the tower activity was up from '11 to '12 as well as the addition of the small-cell business? Yes.
Activity increased on towers from -- going into calendar year 2012 and then again into calendar year 2013.
And then obviously given the timing of our 2 acquisitions into that space as well the things that we've built outside of those acquisitions our exposure to small cells and the size of that business has increased significantly since 2010.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then separately on the services business I think I ask this question every quarter.
But strong again a little less strong than last quarter.
Should we think about that as being indicative of activity overall? Or does that just sort of -- varies pretty widely? It does vary but it's mostly been varying on the upside for a number of quarters as you can see.
A lot of people working very hard on that.
Phil it's been growing.
We've been doing additional scope of work on a per-app basis such as preconstruction zoning work all the way through the installs.
We've done a very nice job of capturing more of that opportunity within the company as carriers are touching our sites.
There's obviously a revenue and margin opportunity that we're capturing.
There's also an asset control and sort of high-touch approach that we take to our assets that we think makes being in the service business important for us.
And so we are continuing to seek out and gain those opportunities and it's continuing to grow as it relates to the level of activity going on in the marketplace today.
And so we certainly expect that to continue as we see continued leasing.
And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen from Macquarie.
Tower improvement and construction CapEx has been elevated over the last few quarters versus historical absolute and relative to sales levels.
I know there's a number of projects including DAS.
How long is this going to last? And when should we start to see -- or is this your normalized sort of CapEx-to-sales ratio? And/or when will we return back to sort of 2011 and early 2012 levels? Function of leasing.
Yes.
Kevin I was going to say it's a function of leasing and it's a combination of 2 things.
If you look at our historical results and you go back to 2011 and look at the 6-year period of time from then we've tripled the number of towers that we own.
So even if activity were constant the level of improvement I would expect would be triple today what it would have been on a historical basis if you were to look back over time.
On top of that what we're seeing is a significant increase as we've talked about it it's in -- depending on how you want to measure it more than double of activity from 2012 to 2013 when we look at new leases that are going on on the asset.
So it's a combination of growth in assets and a significant increase in leasing activity.
As we look forward the answer has kind of stayed the same the level of assets stays constant we would assume at least for modeling purposes that you're looking for.
And then how much CapEx we spend is going to be a function of what's the leasing activity.
And today we're not here to provide guidance beyond calendar year 2013 but we'd expect that the level of spend would be matched with whatever the activity level is.
Obviously when you compare the whole of it we do fantastic investments.
If you look at -- an average tenant that goes on our tower is paying us in the neighborhood of $2 000 a month to go on an asset.
To the extent that we make a capital improvement to hold that asset and as we've shown we reinvest it through a significant portion of that capital expenditure.
This is a fantastic investment that we have in our business and we're happy to spend the money and make the sites ready for these additional tenants.
It's the highest investment of capital we have on the business.
And then your -- on the construction side that's dominated -- at least for now dominated by small-cell network builds that we've talked about.
And as I alluded to we even make it back in the tower-building business as well depending upon the opportunity we see there.
But for now that number is primarily around the small-cell business Kevin.
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.
Research Division</strong> So just a clarification.
Ben do you think -- the services revenue here is this kind of the new normal? I mean you used to be around $50 million per quarter.
Do you think you've built up the infrastructure and you have the customer base so this can kind of stay at this level or grow from here? And I just had another question on LTE also.
I can't represent to you that.
I honestly -- we're doing the best we can.
We're capturing a lot of opportunities and it's continuing to grow every quarter.
But it is completely dependent on application volume and leasing opportunities and so it's a function of that.
And so we see a long runway towards leasing.
We've come through a period where we've had all 4 major carriers building out LTE.
That mix is going to now shift to augmentation in terms of new cell splitting and new co-locations as some of the carriers finish their coverage build their initial coverage build on LTE.
So we'll just have to see.
We're continuing to look for ways successfully I should say to expand the scope of what we're doing with carriers.
And so maybe we can manage to see that stay relatively at these levels even if app volume were to taper off a little bit over time because we're doing more scope within each application.
But it's something we're looking at carefully.
And we're managing this and frankly going about as fast as we can go right now given the opportunity out there.
Research Division</strong> And so with the LTE build candidly [ph] I would say a lot of the equipment is going on existing leases that were modified.
Are we basically done with that process at the end of the year and the new LTE builds and cell splitting will be just absolutely incremental revenue for next year and beyond? I'd say substantially done this year with AT&amp;T and Verizon as they have confirmed.
And then we would -- and then we certainly anticipate as we're continuing to see the pipeline build for them in terms of cell splitting both on -- both for macro sites as well as opportunities on the small-cell networks to augment capacity around LTE as their sort of second wave.
And then as you look into Sprint and T-Mobile talk about their LTE build with Network Vision and their network modernization plan a little bit further behind but obviously very committed to delivering that same product for consumers.
And so you can just sort of follow down through the Big 4 and see this wave coming and that's exactly what we've seen.
Verizon announcing that they've basically hit $300 million tops their coverage build is initially complete and then they're going to come right back and add capacity for all the purposes and reasons that they stated.
We anticipate that times 4 because you're going to see that right behind what's happening with AT&amp;T Sprint and then T-Mobile.
And so that mix change over time back to your first question about what was augmentation on an existing site we think that -- we can see it in our numbers.
Absolutely that's tailing off.
A lot of that was pre-contracted if you remember presold.
That's tailing off and then the revenue-generating activity is more than making up for that tail-off.
Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore.
Research Division</strong> Two if I may.
First in terms of the prepaid you've given kind of detail already.
But one of the things you noted was that it was -- the breakdown was maybe 25% DAS and 75% towers.
And it doesn't seem like DAS is 25% of your revenues.
So just understanding if there is a larger component of upfront prepaids associated with DAS relative to the revenue stream versus towers? And then secondly in terms of activity again you've given us a lot of color on the new cell site activity.
And I'm wondering if you're seeing amendment spend the activity there slow or that activity has kind of been steady and the new cell site activity has been incremental? And then I guess if you could give us the breakdown of new cell sites versus amendment activity in the quarter it'd be helpful.
Sure on your prepaid rent question 25% of it is DAS related.
And while if you counted the number of assets that we have we obviously have a much larger portfolio of towers than DAS we're building and deploying a significant number of small cells.
And so we've talked about the fact that while it represents less than 5% of the business it could be in the neighborhood of about 20% of our growth in calendar year 2014.
And we're seeing a very similar thing in terms of the prepaid rent as it would match where the activity goes.
So it's -- while it's a smaller portion of the overall assets it's a meaningful amount and meaningful contribution to the growth rate that we're seeing in the business.
Jonathan the only thing that's tailing off on the leasing side is what I mentioned before which is amendments related to MLA terms that were presold which would have been the initial wave of LTE upgrades typically.
And so we're continuing to see applications around amendments that are outside the scope of that microwave dishes and new co-locations grow very significantly.
As I mentioned co-los standalone comparison up 2.5x year-over-year.
Total new revenue-generating activity up sort of double year-over-year.
And the only thing tailing off in our activity levels are what was presold if you will as we sort of reach -- again my guess is we're probably 60% or 70% through that presold commitment if you will as it tails off.
And your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS.
Research Division</strong> We saw another increase to expectations for gross margins in this quarter and also G&amp;A as a percent of sales improved.
Can we expect these trends to continue from here? And can you also talk a little bit about the drivers of that improvement? Sure.
The gross margin improvements are related to revenue growth and the cost structure is relatively stable particularly with regards to towers.
As we build and deploy additional small-cell networks the initial margins of those networks would be lower than our legacy portfolio so it has a bit of a drag effect.
But we've seen great growth there and the margins are increasing significantly and that obviously helped the overall margins.
On the G&amp;A side as we've ramped the services business and seen the additional activity we've certainly added additional people in the business to manage that activity.
And so I would point you to the fact that it's -- those 2 items are correlated and we'd expect the G&amp;A line will move to some degree in proportion with what we see from the services business over time.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And one other question on public safety.
We've been reading some news that there is some activity on a regional basis.
Have you had any discussions with public safety network builds? Yes would be the short answer.
As you can imagine we're in the middle of that dialogue wouldn't elaborate a whole lot yet.
And it's certainly not in our leasing existing or future.
But it's nice to see an opportunity out there like that where with our portfolio that we've assembled I think we can bring a lot to the table to help them there.
And you can assume that we're in the middle of those conversations.
The next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen from Pacific Crest.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to get back to Sprint a little bit.
By my numbers it looks like your revenue is the most exposed to Sprint and I wanted to find out if you're seeing any pickup of activity over there given the recent closures of their deals.
And I guess correlated with that did you see some slowdown in the first half and particularly in the second quarter? And then I guess the same thing could be said for T-Mobile and PCS.
If you could give us an update on build activity there.
Yes Michael we always -- we're a little careful about letting the carriers speak for themselves around specific activity.
But let me just say that for the last 2 years we have been going flat out with Sprint on their Network Vision upgrade and I would not say there's been any slowdown that we can perceive.
We've got a very significant amount of amendment activity work from Network Vision and we've done a lot of services work there as well.
I would anticipate with the Softbank closing -- obviously it's early days but with what they've said publicly we can anticipate a network build that looks a lot like what you're seeing from others.
And so as they get the initial coverage build done on LTE we'll see significant densification and additional sites added.
Again that sort of needs to finish the first path on coverage build first but we haven't seen a slowdown.
It's been very active.
And with T-Mobile with Metro PCS obviously they're going through an integration phase there.
We've seen a lot of activity around their network modernization program and we certainly expect that they're going to make the significant investment required.
And we'll see that same sort of movie all over again with T-Mobile.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And then one last question if I could.
Obviously there's been a lot of speculation out there with regard to the large portfolio towers at AT&amp;T probably less so at Verizon but I guess the question is the same for both.
If you could talk to us a little bit about what type of towers and whether those towers are attractive not just to you but to the tower industry in general? Can you talk about maybe some of the puts and takes there with regard to some of those towers in both their portfolios that they still own? Sure.
What's attractive -- and you can most recently see this in our T-Mobile example and the towers we acquired from T-Mobile.
What's attractive is having a portfolio that's available for co-location obviously in the locations where you need the assets where the densification is going to occur and that's urban sites that's top 100 cities and that's been our focus for the last 10 years.
And that's how we've ended up with a portfolio that looks like -- looks as it does.
And so our evaluation of really any opportunity whether -- you mentioned a couple would always center around the location of the assets and the opportunity that it represents to solve additional needs for other carriers through the occupancy of those sites.
And as equipment gets smaller and more creative and the lines even begin to blur between a full macro site and a small cell I think you'll see the industry getting more creative over time as to what you put on a tower that ultimately solves the carriers' needs all against the backdrop of the benefit of the shared economics and the sharing of the site which again we think is sort of the compelling thing that we bring to the market.
The ability to get carriers on the air and also give them the benefit of sharing the economics of the site we think is sort of what makes our industry.
And that's how we'll evaluate portfolios in the future.
And your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.
LLC Research Division</strong> Two if I may.
The first one a lot of talk about rising interest rates the last few months and just curious how you may have seen that impact your business.
And I guess more specifically as rates were rising did you see that impact deal valuation? And maybe did that actually impact how you are valuing potential tower acquisitions? And then the second question I know this had been talked about already but as it relates to cell splitting can you just remind us what the impact is of that on GAAP? And I guess with you calling out [Audio Gap] I'm just trying to understand the impact to the income statement.
Sure.
On the first question the direct impact to our interest expense is relatively minor from rises in interest rates.
The vast majority of our existing debt is financed for a long period of time and it's fixed rate.
We do have some exposure to floating-rate debt.
Most of that floating-rate debt already has the LIBOR floor and current LIBOR rates are well below the floor so we've not seen anything there.
Obviously as you think about buying assets or buying back stock the cost of the capital is a factor in how we think about that.
And so we would adjust as we go along how we think about the relative value of assets and stock and purchases of land or building towers.
On your second question around the impact of new leases we have not done any presell agreements related to -- in our GAAP revenue numbers related to brand-new leases.
So the activity that we presold which we talked about that we think we've gone through -- gotten through most of that activity thus far that we're going to see related to what was presold that activity was all amendment-related.
So to the extent that a tenant wants to go on a tower they're not currently located on that would be additive to our growth rate.
And my prior comments I think you could see this in the numbers the sequential growth in revenues if you adjust for the onetime items that we've noted for you and adjust for the FX headwind that we're facing in the back half of the year is meaningful in the back half of the year.
And if you look at our leasing as we look at the numbers there's significantly more leasing in the back half of the year on a net basis than what we saw in the first half of the year.
And so the sequential growth in steps will be -- we would expect to be larger in the back half of the year.
As is typically the case in the tower business that revenue growth is back-end loaded in the calendar year.
Okay great.
Listen I appreciate everybody hanging with us today.
We went a little bit long about 70 minutes.
We have a lot of runway a lot to get accomplished this year very much excited about the balance of the year.
And thanks for your attention this morning.
We'll talk to you on the next call.
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the conference call for today.
Thank you for participating.
Please disconnect your lines.
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Crown Castle International Q3 2013 Earnings Conference Call held on the 21st of October 2013.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Fiona McKone.
Please go ahead ma'am.
Thank you.
Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us as we review our third quarter 2013 results and discuss our agreement to acquire the exclusive rights to approximately 9 700 towers from AT&amp;T that we announced yesterday.
With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.
Ben is going to begin with a discussion of the AT&amp;T transaction and Jay will follow with a review of our third quarter 2013 results and our outlook for 2013 and 2014.
To aid the discussion we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website crowncastle.com which we will discuss throughout the call this morning.
This conference call will contain forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations.
Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable it can give no assurances that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions.
Information about the potential factors that could affect the company's financial results is available in the press release and in the Risk Factors sections of the company's filings with the SEC.
Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual results may vary significantly from those expected.
Our statements are made as of today October 21 2013 and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise.
In addition today's call may include discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA funds from operations funds from operations per share adjusted funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations per share.
Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures are available under the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.
With that I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Fiona and thank you to all of you for joining us on this rather short notice call this morning as we discuss this very exciting news that we announced yesterday as well as review our earnings release for the third quarter.
First let me start by saying this transaction we've announced is all about growth pure and simple and our belief in growth and accretion and AFFO per share relative to other potential investments we could have made over time.
In acquiring the rights to these 9 700 towers from AT&amp;T we're continuing to execute our principal strategic objective: positioning Crown Castle as the leader in the U.S.
market the largest wireless market in the world and one that we believe is the most continuable -- continuing profitable investment in wireless networks is most assured.
These towers are well positioned to accommodate the demand we're seeing as network intensification following the initial phase of LTE deployment is driving macro site co-location in the market.
This opportunity with this portfolio with AT&amp;T as the counter-party is generational in nature.
Post-closing AT&amp;T will be our largest customer at 26% of revenues and the Big 4 U.S.
wireless carriers will make up 84% of our consolidated site rental revenue a clear differentiator among our peers.
I want to take a moment here to acknowledge and thank our friends at AT&amp;T for the confidence they have placed in Crown Castle over the years and now as we extend our relationship to cover these new sites.
Turning to Slide 6.
Importantly as noted in our press release from a financial perspective we expect this transaction to be slightly accretive to AFFO per share in 2014 and expect that it is meaningfully accretive to our expected growth over time.
As is our practice we were disciplined and focused in our financial assessment of this transaction and believe it will be more accretive to our long-term growth rates in enhancing the shareholder value relative to other potential investments such as buying back our own stock.
In fact we expect the transaction to be approximately 5% accretive to our long-term expected AFFO per share.
While this transaction increases our tower portfolio by 33% in the U.S.
the consideration represents only 15% of our enterprise value illustrating the significant growth opportunity we have secured on these relatively young assets which currently have on average only 1.7 tenants per tower.
Further as is customary in tower transactions with carriers the rent we receive from AT&amp;T includes access to additional space on the towers for its future use subject to certain restrictions.
Additionally we have the right to lease space to additional tenants which is the essential element of the value creation in this transaction.
Further we believe the AT&amp;T towers have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least 1 additional tenant per tower without significant further investment.
We have a long track record of integrating assets and creating value from our customer relationships solutions and services.
Turning to Slide 7.
Let me run through some of the details of the transaction and some of the reasons why we believe this is a terrific transaction for Crown Castle.
Under our agreement with AT&amp;T we will have the right and responsibilities to operate the asset like any others that we own.
We will take $4.85 billion to AT&amp;T for the exclusive rights to lease and operate these towers for a weighted average life of approximately 28 years and we will have the right to purchase such towers thereafter.
As part of the transaction AT&amp;T is contracted to maintain its communications facilities on the towers for a minimum of 10 years across all of the sites.
We expect to fund the transaction with cash on hand and equity and debt financing including borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility.
And we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Turning to Slide 8.
At almost 40 000 towers pro forma with 71% or 28 000 sites in the top 100 markets this transaction furthers our strategic objective of being the leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
which we believe is the largest and fastest growing and most profitable wireless market in the world.
As you can see from the graph the U.S.
is the global leader in average revenue per user and yet there is still a considerable amount of expected growth in mobile data traffic still to come.
This transaction comes at an opportune time for co-locations as all 4 major wireless carriers are actively upgrading their networks for LTE 4G and these sites are well positioned to accommodate the cell splitting that we're already seeing as carriers focus on improving network quality.
At recent industry conference keynote addresses wireless carriers continue to voice their commitment to network upgrade as the price of admission to compete in the U.S.
market.
With networks already supply-constrained in the face of broadband data growth estimates of 6 to 8x over the next 4 years it's very clear to us that the U.S.
market is one where we will see significant growth in the years to come.
The top U.S.
markets are where wireless traffic is heaviest and where wireless carriers traditionally focus their efforts to deploy new technologies and upgrades to existing technologies such as the current LTE deployment and network densification.
Turning to Slide 9.
We believe that the U.S.
market represents the most compelling risk-adjusted returns for capital investment in wireless infrastructure.
These AT&amp;T towers represent a unique opportunity to acquire a large urban-centric portfolio and further our strategy.
On a pro forma basis we will have 71% of our towers listed in the top 100 markets and 96% of our total sites located in the U.S.
One of the areas that also bolsters our belief in the U.S.
market is the ability of infrastructure owners to control the ground beneath their assets for very long periods of time.
Our team has been focused on this for years and I believe we have the most secured ground profile in the industry as we control land under our sites for more than 20 years generating 72% of our site rental gross margin.
Turning to Slide 10 I also believe the quality of our tenant base is the best in the industry with 84% of our pro forma consolidated site rental revenues coming from the Big 4 wireless carriers.
As a result of the transaction we will have more than $21 billion of future contracted revenue from our existing customer leases which represents approximately 8 years of run rate site rental revenue.
Shown on Slide 11 our demonstrated track record of growing site rental revenue and allocating capital productively has enabled us to grow AFFO per share by a 20% compound annual growth rate dating back to 2007.
I would point out that we've been able to achieve our annual growth -- AFFO without increasing our risk profile by focusing our capital allocation on the U.S.
market.
As shown on Page 12 we have gotten over the short -- we've proven over the short and long term that we're able to transact integrate lease and operate carrier assets in ways that create significant value.
Our transaction with AT&amp;T is the sixth wireless carrier portfolio transaction that we have done in the U.S.
On the left-hand side of the page we've shown the growth in yield before these transactions that date back over a decade.
These assets continue to increase their cash flow and resulting yields.
I will also note that our T-Mobile transaction that we completed just under a year ago is fully integrated and tracking ahead of our original acquisition model.
We believe like the value we have created from the 5 other carrier tower transactions we've done we will continue to drive shareholder value through our operation of these towers.
Fundamentally this is a real estate business and our experience has been that carrier-built towers are in the best locations time and time again.
In addition to the carrier transactions we've seen tremendous growth in our NextG acquisition in the small cell business that we completed in April of 2012 where we have more than doubled the adjusted EBITDA since closing the transaction.
Leveraging our experienced management team customer relationships and services offerings across this unrivaled tower footprint together with our leadership in small cell networks positions us to be the provider of choice as carriers continue to enhance their networks to meet ever-increasing wireless demand.
So let me conclude on this topic of the transaction before I call -- turn the call over to Jay by offering the following observation.
Over the last 18 months including this transaction we've invested approximately $9 billion in the U.S.
market adding over 17 000 towers and 10 000 small cell nodes that we believe materially enhances our growth opportunity as these assets are essential to meeting carriers' network demands with the benefit of the shared infrastructure model that we deliver for carriers.
We are bullish on the U.S.
market to say the least and bring the execution capability to realize on our strategy.
We believe the premier location of the assets low existing tenant fees high operating leverage and minimal incremental costs together with the efficient capital structure we have in place strengthens our position as a leader in facilitating wireless network deployment in the U.S.
while enhancing our long-term growth rates and AFFO per share expectations.
With that I would like to turn the call over to Jay to walk through our results and outlook and thank you again for joining this call this morning.
Thanks Ben and good morning everyone.
As you've seen from our press release this morning we had an excellent third quarter delivering 38% growth in AFFO per share compared to the same quarter last year.
The strong leasing activity continued during the third quarter.
Further as you would expect this high level of leasing activity from all 4 major U.S.
carriers resulted in continued strong performance in our services business which outperformed our expectation for the third quarter.
On Slide 14 and 15 we highlight some of the results for our third quarter.
During the third quarter we generated site rental revenue of $621 million up 15% from the third quarter of 2012.
We have seen a significant shift towards higher revenue growth because of the composition of our leasing activity during 2013 compared to 2012.
As we've previously disclosed a portion of the leasing activity we have seen in recent years is the result of agreements we have made with certain carriers whereby they commit to pay us for the right to add equipment to their existing arrays on our towers and then utilize that predefined right over time.
As a result we recognized revenue beginning at the firm commitment dates of these agreements.
We have often described these arrangements as presold leasing agreements.
Notably during the third quarter of 2013 only 20% of our leasing activity was covered by these presold leasing agreements.
Conversely presold leasing agreements accounted for almost 70% of the leasing activity in the same quarter last year.
This change in the composition of our leasing activity reflects the carriers' focus on deploying their equipment on additional sites commonly referred to as site densification an amendment activity to their existing arrays that exceeds what was contemplated in the presold leasing arrangement.
I would also note that we are seeing tremendous leasing activity in our small cell networks as carriers look for ways to improve their networks in areas not served by traditional macro sites.
With regard to our other metrics for the quarter site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenues less the cost of operations was $439 million up 9% from the third quarter of 2012.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2013 was $441 million up 10% from the third quarter of 2012.
As shown AFFO for the third quarter of 2013 was $318 million up 38% from the third quarter of 2012 and AFFO per share was $1.09 up 38% from the third quarter of 2012.
Moving on to investments and liquidity.
During the third quarter as shown on Slide 16 we've spent $131 million on capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $18 million on our land lease purchase program $10 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $103 million on revenue-generating capital expenditure consisting of $74 million on existing sites and $29 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell networks.
Additionally during the third quarter we borrowed $800 million of incremental Term Loan B under the existing senior-secured credit agreement with terms substantially the same as our existing Term Loan B.
The proceeds were used to pay a portion of the outstanding revolving credit loan.
As of September 30 2013 we had approximately $219 million in cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash and approximately $1.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility.
We ended the third quarter of 2013 with total net debt the last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6x at the high end of our targeted level of leverage.
On Slide 17 and 18 we have reflected our updated outlook for 2013.
Importantly we have not included any impact from the AT&amp;T tower transaction in our 2013 outlook.
Our revised full year 2013 outlook suggests annual site rental revenue growth of 17% and AFFO growth of 39%.
Also shown on Slide 17 and 18 is our 2014 outlook.
Let me spend a minute walking through the key assumptions that we included in our 2014 outlook.
We anticipate the AT&amp;T towers will contribute approximately $245 million to $255 million to our 2014 AFFO before financing.
Further we expect approximately $175 million to $185 million of organic cash revenue growth in 2014 ignoring the impact from straight-line revenue adjustment.
We expect this $175 million to $185 million of organic cash revenue growth to be comprised equally of new tenant activity and cash escalators.
As we noted in the press release we expect 25% to 30% more revenue from new leases in 2014 than we saw in 2013.
Further we expect that only about 10% of our leasing activity will be covered by the presold leasing arrangement that I mentioned earlier in this call.
In addition our 2014 outlook for site rental revenue includes the negative impact of churn of approximately $50 million or 2% of our site rental revenue.
Approximately half of this amount is typical churn activity and half is from Sprint's decommissioning of their legacy Nextel iDEN network.
Based on Sprint's stated intention to decommission their iDEN network and our contractual terms with Sprint we expect approximately 3% of our run rate site rental revenue to be impacted by the iDEN decommissioning over time.
These iDEN leases have effective term end dates spread evenly throughout 2014 and 2015.
As a result we expect the reduction of site rental revenues from the iDEN decommissioning to be approximately 1% in 2014 with the remaining 2% impact coming after 2014.
In essence our expected impact from churn for 2014 is approximately 60% of the cash revenue growth from our contracted lease escalation during the calendar year 2014.
With respect to 2014 adjusted EBITDA we anticipate that site rental direct expenses and G&amp;A on our existing portfolio of sites will grow approximately 1% from 2013 and the contribution from services gross margin will be approximately $25 million lower than the contribution in 2013.
For 2014 AFFO we expect that the contribution from prepaid rent net of amortization will be approximately $20 million higher than that of 2013 reflecting the expected increase in leasing activity and the 33% larger asset base as a result of the AT&amp;T tower transaction.
Further our forecast for 2014 AFFO is negatively impacted by approximately $17 million in expected sustaining capital expenditures to remodel and expand certain of our office facilities which we would not expect to recur in the foreseeable future.
In summary we expect AFFO per share in 2014 pro forma for the AT&amp;T tower transaction including the impact of the related expected financing to be slightly accretive to what our expectation for AFFO per share would have been without this transaction.
Moving to Slide 19.
In September we announced our plans to elect real estate investment trust status commencing January 2014.
We are making good progress on the tasks necessary to make this happen.
Pursuant to our anticipated REIT conversion and subject to the successful completion and financing of the AT&amp;T tower transaction we're excited to announce this morning our intention to initiate a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2014.
Given the significant anticipated cash flow from our existing business and future cash flows from the AT&amp;T tower we expect to be able to continue to make significant investment with our cash flow after dividend in activities we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.
These activities include: investing in acquisition; the construction of new sites including small cell networks; land purchases; and the purchase of our own securities including common shares.
Based on our expectation for growth in our business we believe that we can grow our dividend over the next 5 years by at least 15% annually while consuming the vast majority of our net operating losses.
In summary we are excited about Crown Castle's leadership role in wireless infrastructure.
Our announced AT&amp;T tower transaction furthers our focus on the U.S.
market and expands our portfolio in the top 100 markets while increasing our expected growth rates of revenue and cash flow.
Given the significant pro forma cash flow we expect to generate we plan to be able to continue to make meaningful investments while providing investors with a regular dividend.
We believe we have positioned our company to benefit greatly from the tremendous consumer demand for mobile Internet and data services in the U.S.
and the Crown team is ready to deliver the high level of customer experience that the carriers have come to expect from us.
And with that operator we'll turn the call over for questions.
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Ric Prentiss from the company Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> In a week and the deal's finally official huh? A couple of questions on it.
First the assumptions on having it be slightly accretive after the financing.
Can you talk to us a little bit about how you're looking at cash and the debt the form of debt and the equity and timing for all those different offerings given that you want to close it by yearend? Sure Ric.
I think there's a wide range of options here in terms of what would make the transaction accretive in the short term and also in the long term.
For purposes of this call we're not going to get into any specificity about the portion of the consideration split among cash equity and debt.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And how about the timing as far as when you would -- the deal closes in fourth quarter which we're already a good bit through.
Would the equity operating be done as well within the fourth quarter? Ric we're not going to get again to allot specificity around timing or amount but obviously we'll need to raise the capital prior to closing the transaction.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then when you guys did the T-Mobile transaction you mentioned that there would be some G&amp;A impact but also some benefit on your services business.
Any need to ramp up G&amp;A given the size of this portfolio? There will be.
We would expect about $6 million of additional G&amp;A during calendar year 2014 related to staffing the business in order to handle these additional assets.
We would expect at least as we gave the guidance that to be completely covered by services.
We very well may be able to do better than that but our assumption was that services gross margin offset the G&amp;A when it gets the EBITDA impact.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And I'll try the defending question right away.
Any thoughts about how fast you would want to get back into your target zone of 4 to 6? You mentioned that you're at obviously the high end right now.
Yes.
I would describe our 4 to 6x as a long-term leverage target ratio and I think you've seen us operate in and around that level.
At times we've been above it.
At other times we've been slightly below it.
So I think it's exactly that.
It's not a bright line but it's a target level of leverage that we would expect to maintain over a long period of time.
And our next question comes from David Barden from the company Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> This is Stephen Douglas standing in for David.
One question on iDEN.
I think in the past you talked about 3% of revenue exposure coming down kind of ratably over the last 2 years.
But it looks like you're expecting that about 1/3 of that in 2014.
So I guess could you just talk about some of the moving pieces there and maybe just your conversation with Sprint? And then second just more of a housekeeping item.
What is the kind of maintenance CapEx assumptions that you're baking in for that $245 million to $255 million AFFO contribution from the AT&amp;T deal? Sure.
Stephen on the first question as we think about the iDEN exposure that we have Sprint has the right ratably as you stated correctly over 2014 and 2015 to not renew leases as they come to their effectual term end date.
We won't know ultimately how many of those get renewed or not until we reach those dates.
So purposes -- for our purposes what we've assumed -- when I speak to the 1% in calendar year 2014 we've assumed that none of the leases none of the iDEN leases that come to their effectual terms end date during 2014 are renewed.
Obviously any lease that is renewed in the latter half of -- that is not renewed in the latter half of 2014 we don't see a full year impact.
So there's a bit of a laddering of the impact to revenues during calendar year 2014 than 2015 and then we would see a tail of it in 2016.
It's the licenses that are canceled in the latter half of 2015.
If they are we would see the full impact of the site rental revenue line in 2016.
With regards to your second question we've assumed about $6 million roughly of maintenance CapEx related to the asset.
I mentioned in my prepared remarks the investment that we're making to expand some of our office facilities and remodel.
Those costs should be for -- only in calendar year 2014.
I wouldn't expect those to recur at least in the foreseeable future.
But $6 million increase that you can see in the forecast we would expect that to recur and that's related directly to these assets.
And our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Jay a quick one on the guidance.
Services gross margin you have that down $25 million in '14.
Are you just being conservative there? Obviously you had another strong services quarter.
How should we think about the visibility into that? And then Ben I know you talked a bit about densification.
We've heard a lot about this at the tower show the other day.
Can you get into a little bit more color on what you're seeing from some of the carriers? Verizon talked a lot about AWS just last week and Sprint's progress on Clearwire.
Sure Simon.
First of all it is October and our tradition is being conservative on services guidance and we've been wrong for a number of years on that I'm happy to report.
But I would remind everybody that that is a business that while has grown significantly is different than the recurring site rental business.
So we have necessarily taken a little bit of a haircut to 2013 levels.
And as we mentioned about $25 million year-over-year down would be our assumption in this guidance.
Your question I'll anticipate would be "Well gee with this additional portfolio wouldn't that augment probably your opportunity on the services side?" to which I would acknowledge.
But at the same time we do are seeing a significant mix change towards co-locations as Jay mentioned.
So we're a little conservative on that outlook right now and we'll continue to see how well we can do.
On the Verizon and AT&amp;T and other -- the Big 4 carriers in terms of the leasing mix this year and what we're seeing we have seen a dramatic shift this year in leasing.
And as Jay mentioned our outlook for 2014 is about 90% of our revenue going forward of our incremental revenue is occurring on either through co-locations or amendments that are falling outside of these presold agreements that we have with several of the carriers.
A significant portion of that is made up through co-location activity or network densification if you will as the initial path of LTE goes through these markets and as the carriers have eloquently explained these networks are supply-constrained if you will.
And so as soon as a site is essentially turned up very shortly thereafter they're looking at network densification or cell splitting which in many times is co-location on an existing tower where they have not previously been.
So we're continuing to see a significant and ramping component of that like we saw years ago as other generations of technologies rolled out and it's nice to see.
It has started principally with Verizon and AT&amp;T but we would expect over time as the Sprint LTE and T-Mobile LTE build go through the markets that they will see a similar experience where they'll need to densify these networks and come back and cell split.
And certainly the capital commitment that all 4 companies are making to the industry right now would suggest that we're going to see significant growth in that regard for some time in the future.
Research Division</strong> And any Clearwire activity? No.
No that's basically yet to come at the Clearwire's spectrum being re-purposed from the Sprint Network Vision upgrades if you will.
That's still in the planning stages but something that we anticipate is coming very soon through the upgrades on the Network Vision sites.
And the next question comes from Brett Feldman from Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> I'm going to take another stab at Ric's just for fun.
You put in place a $3.4 billion bridge loan that was disclosed in the 8-K this morning.
Should we be thinking about that as the upper end of how much debt you're thinking about for this deal? Because you also mentioned you still have cash in the revolver.
I'll start with that one and see how far I get.
Brett I think at that upper end from the disclosure in the 8-K I think that is the upper end which is basically our leverage ratio that we have in our existing debt agreement.
And you could run through that calculation.
I think that's the upper end.
I think beyond that well I'll -- as I did with Ric's question I think I'll pass on being any more specific around our financing plan.
Research Division</strong> That's fair enough.
Just a point of clarification the additional usage rights that AT&amp;T has in tower that's covered by the payment term it's 1 900 and 2% correct? They don't pay extra as long as they stay within that scope of usage? That's correct Brett.
We're not going to get into all the details but I would say that it's consistent with other transactions we've done where they have existing capacity on the site plus some reserve for future growth.
But at the same time they've requested and we've negotiated a rate card for equipment that they would contemplate potentially adding over time that would result in additional equipment beyond this reserve capacity and the additional rent to go with it.
So for planning purposes to be honest in the near term I wouldn't suggest to you that's going to be a significant revenue event for us but longer term we'll have to see what their needs actually are on the sites.
And most importantly in a transaction like this we have not encumbered the sites that we'd be leasing to prevent us from adding co-location to these sites whether on the tower or on the ground.
So we are very confident in our ability as we have with the other transactions we've completed over the years add additional tenants to these sites and that's obviously where the real value driver is in these types of transactions.
Research Division</strong> So one last one if you don't mind.
How did you settle on the 2% escalator? I think you've most recently been doing CTI in large deals.
And historically you've been more 3.5%.
I'm just wondering if that's something you're going to be looking to apply to more leases going forward.
I wouldn't anticipate it.
This was a competitive process and a requirement that AT&amp;T wanted to see in their MLA here with us on this transaction specifically.
And so we were -- we obviously priced that into how we thought about the economics of the transaction.
But I wouldn't anticipate that would be the case going forward.
And the next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Just a follow-up on Brett's prior questions.
On the reserve capacity I guess what I'm trying to understand is do you feel comfortable that there's additional upside potential longer term here based on the scope of the reserve that you've struck with AT&amp;T? Just trying to understand sort of what you've seen historically with these types of contracts and how we should think about further opportunities down the line.
Sure.
The short answer is yes we do see additional upside and that has been our experience over time when we have reserve capacity or presold agreements or however they've been structured over time is that there's certainly a period where they use the reserve capacity that they've negotiated and then over time depending upon what equipment requirements are and subsequent generations of technologies.
And that's the very reason why we have a preexisting rate card negotiated in this transaction.
Both parties know what the pricing on that would be to the extent they need capacity above their reserve capacity and that's been our experience over many years.
So that ultimately does come into play.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And if I may one more follow-up.
What type of investment may be required on these types of assets in order to drive additional co-location opportunities? It seemed like from some of the discussions at the recent tower trade show there have been some varied opinions in terms of the qualities of the towers.
So I'd love to hear sort of your viewpoint there.
Sure Amir the -- and thanks for that question.
That's -- our experience has been very positive on these carrier-located towers.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks fundamentally this is a real estate business in our view.
And location of the asset is the primary driver along with the ability to execute for customers and do all the other things that we work on very hard every day.
We've gotten pretty good at adding capacity to these towers.
As Jay mentioned our expectation on this transaction is there's at least one tenant of additional capacity on these sites without significantly more investment.
But even where there is additional investment required over time as there has been in others that we've acquired those turn out to be fantastic investments.
And as you can see depicted in our slides well I think for the first time in a long time we've broken out the yields that we've accomplished the growth in yields from the original transaction with carrier towers.
They're roughly quadrupled what we originally acquired the sites over a decade ago.
And so the experience has been one where we add yield.
We certainly add net -- structural capacity where required.
That takes additional investment.
Very often that is significantly shared with the carrier adding that tenant on the tower.
But over time we have a track record of adding significantly to the yield on these sites and we'd expect that to be the case here.
And the following question is from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore.
Research Division</strong> Two if I could.
First in terms of the AT&amp;T towers is it fair to assume that the rate that AT&amp;T is paying is equivalent or in the range of what the other 0.7 tenants per tower is paying? That is if we think about the 1 900 can we extrapolate out to figure out what the site leasing revenue from the entire portfolio would look like maybe somewhere in the $375 million range? And then a second question is there any iDEN or PCS exposure or different MLAs that applies to the AT&amp;T towers that we should be aware of? Sure Jonathan.
On your first question in terms of the other tenants that are on the tower their terms do look like market rates both in terms of the amounts they pay per month as well as their escalation provision.
There is approximately including AT&amp;T's the rent we would expect to collect from AT&amp;T next year there's approximately a little over $400 million of total revenue from the AT&amp;T towers portfolio.
And as I mentioned the terms of the other tenants are on market terms.
That would be true also for the iDEN exposure that is there.
There is a little bit but it's fairly minimal.
We think maybe over the next couple of years that would be about $5 million roughly would be our impact from that.
I would point out to you in the comments that I made earlier around our churn both in calendar year 2014 and beyond those numbers that I gave you in terms of the impact include any churn that we would expect from these AT&amp;T towers with regards to iDEN.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And maybe even one last shot at the financing.
Do these towers look like they are prepared for securitization? Certainly anytime that we negotiate these agreements we think about long-term financing capabilities of the assets.
And this structure is one that we are able to finance if we should choose to go down the path of doing a secured transaction like what we've done in the past.
And obviously we've done securitizations on assets that are in a similar structure as to what these are.
The next question comes from Kevin Smithen from Macquarie.
You've got into an initial 1.8% dividend yield and 15%-plus 5-year dividend growth.
I was wondering if you could elaborate on the impact of your remaining NOLs on that and how that will -- how we should think about the compounding of the dividend and the growth.
Is this going to be a hockey stick once the NOLs expire or are utilized can get to significantly greater than 15% based on a 70% payout on 2016 x NOLs AFFO? Yes Kevin.
This is Ben.
We had to start somewhere.
And this payout is a little bit less than 1/3 of AFFO guidance for 2014.
We think it's a meaningful start on the dividend path as you suggest but gives us plenty of flexibility to allocate capital for growth-enhancing investments over time.
We've put the 15% -- at least 15% growth out there as a target as an expectation.
But as you rightly point out over time as we consume the NOL as it's currently sheltering that income but as net income rises and we consume the NOL once that's close to exhausted we would have a much more significant payout over time.
And if you extrapolate that out you can pretty easily get to the 15% growth over time.
And that final payout ratio once we're a full dividend payer with no NOL shelter is probably in the 75% range of AFFO.
So a very significant payout coming.
It was just a lively debate that we had among ourselves and with some friendly shareholders who were not shy about giving us their opinion on where we should start this dividend and the path that it should take as we get to the inevitability of a very high payout ratio probably in the next 3 or 4 years.
So will you grow dividends 15% while you still have some NOLs let's call it 2015 maybe 2016? Or is that 15% a 5-year CAGR number? It's meant to be a 5-year CAGR so it would be compounding over time.
That's our anticipation as we start this process.
And the next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.
Research Division</strong> Jay a couple of questions.
It looks like you're guiding next year for organic cash revenue growth around 8% if you were to normalize the iDEN.
Am I thinking about that right? And maybe what was your organic cash revenue growth here this quarter? And then just a rough idea on that future option payment that -- how you're kind of thinking what the net present value of that is.
Sure.
On your first question Tim you've got it exactly right.
Our embedded organic growth -- if you think about it on a same tower sales basis was right at about 8% that's about 25% to 30% more than what we expect for our full year 2013 outlook and is a reflection of both an increase in absolute level of activity as well as the mix shift that I spoke about in terms of what percentage is covered by our presold leasing arrangement.
And as we expect in 2014 only 10% of that activity we think is going to be -- come from this presold leasing arrangement.
So there is a significant amount of additional growth in that 8% organic growth about 4% about roughly or a little over 4% 4% to 5% is coming from new leasing activity; and then the balance coming from cash escalations a little over 3% coming from cash escalations.
And then as I mentioned the offset to that the churn amounts are about 60% of the cash benefit from escalations.
So that should bridge the growth we expect in organic cash revenues in the next calendar year.
Research Division</strong> And the net present value how you're thinking about the future payment 28 years out or so.
Yes.
I think there's a bunch of different ways to think about it.
Depending on how you view the cost of capital whether you use a blended rate or if you assume we keep balance sheet appropriately levered over the term I think it will add about if you want to bring it back to present value about 1/2 the churn a little over 1 churn to be -- to the purchase price that was paid is probably the right way to think about it.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And lastly are you seeing much interest from REIT investors at this point given the announcement? Have you had an acceleration there? Certainly since September we've had a number of conversations with REIT investors as we put out our announcement that are -- we intended to convert -- we intend to convert in September.
It's a little early this morning to get any feedback on our dividend announcement but I would imagine that over the coming days we'll be having significant conversations over the coming month.
And the next question comes from Michael Bowen from Pacific Crest.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just a couple questions if I may.
With regard to the tower portfolio you acquired I think a press release said that nearly half are in the top 50 markets.
If I recall T-Mobile those towers that you had acquired 72% were in the top 50.
Can you help us in -- what is the significance of that from either a current or a future site leasing revenue opportunity and how did you guys think about that? And then secondly I think you said in the release that AT&amp;T has an average term commitment of 10 years for their monthly rent.
Can you give us an idea of what the average term is of the other tenants on the site? Sure Mike.
The concentration of the top 100 markets and the top 50 markets is sort of a fundamental driver in our business.
And it goes to the statement I made earlier about location being the primary driver of leasing.
And so as we look at our company pro forma we'll be about 72% in the top 100 or about 28 000 sites.
And a little over 50% of this portfolio was actually in the top 50 markets.
So it certainly met our criteria for concentration in urban markets where network enhancements are obviously most required where the population lives and where the consumption of network capacity is the greatest.
And so this certainly met all of those hurdles for us internally.
The -- their -- you're correct.
Their -- AT&amp;T's commitment on their communications facilities on these sites will be 10 years and the co-locations that exist today the 0.7 additional tenants per tower are on a variety of terms 5 to 10 years with typically multiple renewal options that would be customary in the industry.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And just as a quick follow-up.
Do you think that given this portfolio is in a lower percentage of the top 50 markets is there any difference do you think in the future growth of the site leasing revenue versus the T-Mobile portfolio? We don't think so.
We think at some level you get down to sort of splitting hairs and we think these are certainly well-located sites with an urban and suburban concentration that given our experience in our own portfolio it would certainly suggest that there's significant leasing opportunities still to come.
I think Michael you could also look at the 4 carriers transactions that we presented on the slides and that Ben was -- during his prepared remarks.
You could see on the slides the 4 carriers transactions that we did going back a decade ago.
The percentage in the top 100 markets is very similar to what we acquired here in this AT&amp;T tower transaction.
And so I think that would be a good comparison if you're trying to do it on an apples-to-apples basis.
And the next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.
Research Division</strong> A couple of follow-ups.
One on the 2% escalator can you provide what percent of your total revenues have a CPI or a lower fixed escalator at this point? And how does that compare to the ground lease increases you see every year? Sure.
On our tenant revenue side we have about 10% to 15% of our consolidated leases that have some types of CPI.
Either they may have an absolute outright CPI some of them may have a CPI with a cap or CPI with a floor.
On the ground lease side it's about 25% of the leases that have a CPI-type escalator.
Again many of those would have a cap or have a floor embedded in them.
Over the last several years just in terms of the cash component of that at the cash level with regards to revenue we've been averaging over 3.5% of benefit from the escalation and that would be total escalations including CPI.
And then on the ground lease side those have been right at about 3% over the last several years.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And one question on Clearwire.
You mentioned that Clearwire activity is yet to come.
Should we assume that you did not include much of that in your '14 guidance? We did not include that in our 2014 outlook.
The next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.
LLC Research Division</strong> For guidance for this year you had indicated that you're expecting prepaid rents of $167 million to $182 million.
I was wondering if there was a comparable number for 2014.
And then on that same topic I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations for augmentation for the AT&amp;T in towers in 2014 and I guess even beyond just recognizing that there's only availability for 1 tenant.
And then the just as a quick follow-up in terms of interest rates on debt I wonder if you can just give us an idea of what you would expect whether it was unsecured or secured debt the type of interest rate you would get so regardless of how much you ultimately end up raising since I know you don't want to talk about that right now maybe just what the interest rate you would assume would be.
Sure.
On the first question the prepaid rent component is a direct function of the leasing that we do on the assets and the need for investment of CapEx in order to improve the asset for additional co-location.
And so the increase which we've shown in the -- inside a press release the increase that you see there is a result of those 2 components including the AT&amp;T assets.
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks in 2014 we expect the benefit from that to be about $20 million roughly.
And that ties really to your second portion of your question around the augmentation CapEx that we would expect on the AT&amp;T assets.
It's very similar.
We've made an assumption that's very similar to what we had seen on our own portfolio.
And we would expect as Ben mentioned earlier in the conversation we would expect the vast majority of that to be reimbursed by the tenants let's say as they go on to the site a component of the leasing arrangement that we have with them is that they provide and reimburse us for any capital necessary to improve the site to hold their equipment.
On the last question I think you can see from our public filings where our cost is under our revolving credit facility today given where rates are the cost of that between 2.5% and 2.75%.
Our holding company bonds are trading just over 6% currently or around 6%.
So I'll leave it to you to make your own assumptions around the various components that we use but that's the range of where our debt instruments are.
And obviously depending on the type of structure and the duration the numbers could move but that at least should bound it some level of ranges.
There's one last question coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research.
Two quick questions if I may.
Firstly on the iDEN decommissioning is -- we're hearing from Sprint now talking about more openly about needing a lot more core Network Vision sites than the 38 000 that they had initially targeted.
Is there any benefit for them extending existing iDEN leases that they have with you maybe in different locations from where those initial leases were situated as opposed to letting those leases expire and striking brand-new leases with you? And then the second question is just on the sort of composition of revenues and the composition of the opportunity on the towers you've just acquired.
It seems like if we assume that the towers are capable of carrying 4 tenants that AT&amp;T has reserved -- either it has consumed or has reserved about half of the capacity on those towers for themselves.
I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly.
Yes.
Let me start with your second statement first just so we can clear that up.
No we wouldn't -- we didn't and haven't suggested that: Number one that these are 4-tenant towers; or number two they've consumed half the capacity.
So let's just start over with that.
I think it's important and we can even go back to Colby's question previous.
Our assumption for modeling purposes and planning in a medium-term accretion analysis is sort of what does it take to believe [ph] to get an additional tenant per tower over time.
But that by no means is the outside boundary.
And you look at what we've done on the sites we've owned over the last 12 years and they have significantly more than 1 additional tenant per tower in many many cases.
So it's -- as we affectionately refer to right here there's nothing that an additional capital investment won't cure typically at a very high return on investment when you have additional revenue coming on the sites.
And we would not suggest to you that the AT&amp;T reserve space is the equivalent of effectively half the tower over time.
But Jon let me go back to your first point because I think it's a good one and it's -- it would be -- it's a little bit speculative on our part because as you know Sprint right now with Network Vision and we as a counter-party are working very hard to get their Network Vision sites upgraded on their existing sites for their LTE launch that's ongoing.
And so that is really our focus and I think it's their focus for the time being.
As you move out through 2014 and potentially into 2015 it's logical to assume based on what we're seeing with other carriers that are further along in their LTE deployment that you'll see network densification requirements and they're talking about needing additional cell sites.
Are those typically -- would those happen to be some LTE I mean some iDEN installations that they currently have? Potentially.
I can't for the moment tell you what that would be or how many.
And for planning purposes we've given you the full amount of the scope of what we think that churn event could be over time.
That's 3% of revenue starting with 1% in 2014 and rolling forward as Jay mentioned.
But certainly as you think about it in the back of your mind and walking through the sequencing of events you could see some of the sites perhaps in the latter part of that 2 years be re-purposed.
And we'll just have to wait and see on that one.
But I think we need to wrap up this call.
We're right on an hour.
Again I really want to express my appreciation to those of you who jump on the call early with us this morning on very short notice.
It's not our custom as you know but we wanted to get the news out quickly over the weekend and then -- and follow it up with our earnings call and '14 guidance and the dividend.
And so we've got a lot for you to digest this morning and the merits of this very large and significant transaction that we've announced today.
We are thrilled to death to be going forward and expanding our relationship with AT&amp;T.
Again I want to extend my appreciation to the professionals on the AT&amp;T side that worked with us to get us to this announcement last night.
We've got a lot of work to do internally.
We're getting pretty good at integrating assets and we are really excited to move forward into this environment of expanded relationship with AT&amp;T and look towards closing in the fourth quarter.
So thanks again to everybody for joining us this morning and we'll talk to you soon.
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
That does conclude the Crown Castle International conference call.
Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by.

Thanks Fiona and good morning everyone.
We had an excellent 2013.
In addition to delivering very strong results throughout the year we achieved several significant accomplishments.
In December we completed our $4.85 billion tower transaction with AT&amp;T and have begun the integration process.
We believe that this transaction will be accretive to our long-term growth rates and enhancing shareholder value.
Further this transaction solidifies our strategic objective of being the leader in shared wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
which we believe is the largest fastest-growing and most profitable wireless market in the world.
Also during 2013 we completed the integration of the T-Mobile tower and NextG acquisitions that we closed in 2012.
These expansions of our asset portfolio position us as the preeminent supplier of wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
with the most towers and small cell networks.
Further the timing of these acquisitions provide us with a large portfolio of well-located assets just as the network densification part of the LTE deployment cycle is accelerating and the carriers are transitioning their focus from coverage to network quality.
Additionally in the past 2 years we have completed more than $9 billion in financing activity.
Also during 2013 we completed the necessary steps to convert to a REIT and announced our plan to initiate a quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2014.
On January 1 of this year we commenced operating at the REIT.
In addition to these meaningful events we consistently delivered strong results above our original expectations while maintaining financial flexibility to make opportunistic investments related to our core business that we believe will maximize long-term shareholder value.
For the full year as shown on Slide 3 we grew site rental revenue by 18% adjusted EBITDA by 16% and adjusted funds from operations per share by 40% compared to 2012.
These results were considerably above our expectations at the beginning of 2013.
Further our Services business continued to outperform our expectations delivering strong growth in 2013 as we continue to work very hard to meet customer deployment objectives and facilitate customers' installations on our sites.
With that let me turn to Slide 5 as I highlight some of the results for the fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter of 2013 we generated site rental revenue of $651 million up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2012.
This 14% growth included the benefit of 3% from the AT&amp;T tower transaction.
Further churn and Australia currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 1% each.
We saw a significant increase in U.S.
new leasing activity in the fourth quarter of 2013 representing a more than twofold increase compared to the same period in 2012.
This more than twofold increase includes both new licenses and amendment activity with new license activity representing 65% of new leasing activity.
We believe this activity reflects the carriers' focus on deploying their equipment on additional sites to help ease capacity related issues commonly referred to as site densification.
Further during the fourth quarter of 2013 only 19% of total installations were covered by pre-sold leasing agreements compared to over 70% of the installations in the same quarter of the prior year.
I would also note that we are seeing tremendous leasing activities on our small cell networks as carriers look for ways to improve their networks in areas not served by traditional macro sites.
With regard to our other metrics for the quarter site rental gross margin defined as site rental revenue plus cost of operations was $464 million up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2012.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $468 million up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2012.
AFFO was $359 million up 48% from the fourth quarter of 2012.
Turning to investments and liquidity as shown on Slide 6.
We completed a number of meaningful financings during the fourth quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 2013 we raised approximately $4 billion of net proceeds through the issuance of 41.4 million shares of common stock at $74 per share and 9.8 million shares of 4.5% mandatory convertible preferred stock at $100 per share.
In addition we borrowed $500 million of incremental Term Loan B and $200 million of incremental Term Loan A the proceeds of which together with cash on hand and drawings under our revolving credit facility were used to pay for the AT&amp;T tower transaction.
Further over the past 2 months we repriced our credit facility effectively reducing our per annum interest rate on our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A by 50 basis points.
Additionally we extended the maturities of our revolving credit facility and the vast majority of our term loans.
We currently have $374 million drawn under our revolving credit facility and undrawn capacity of approximately $1.1 billion.
After giving effect to the aforementioned amendments our current weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.3% and the weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6 years.
Pro forma for the AT&amp;T tower transaction and the recent financings we ended 2013 with total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA of 5.5x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense of 4.1x.
Further our balanced approach to financing the recent acquisitions allows us to maintain financial flexibility and to continue to operate within our stated leverage target of between 4x and 6x adjusted EBITDA.
I suspect we'll see our leverage ratio move towards the midpoint of our stated leverage target during 2014 as a result of the expected growth in adjusted EBITDA.
During the fourth quarter we invested $182 million in capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $24 million on our land lease purchase program which continues to perform very well as we work to extend the ground lease maturity and ground ownership of the land beneath our towers.
In total during 2013 we extended over 1 000 land leases and purchased the land beneath more than 800 of our towers.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years the land beneath towers representing approximately 72% of our site rental gross margin.
In fact today 34% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own.
Further the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 29 years.
Having completed over 15 000 land transactions we believe this activity has resulted in the most secure land position in the industry based on land ownership and final ground lease expiration.
Our team is doing a great job on this important endeavor as we remain focused on achieving the long-term benefits of protecting our margins and assets and controlling our largest operating expense.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we spent $21 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $138 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures the latter consisting of $79 million on existing sites and $58 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell construction activity.
Sustaining capital expenditures in the fourth quarter was higher than the third quarter by approximately $10 million primarily as a result of completing some tower maintenance work we had anticipated for 2014 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the purchase of some additional IT equipment.
For the full year 2013 as illustrated on Slide 7 of the presentation site rental revenues were approximately $2.5 billion up $379 million or 18% from 2012.
This 18% growth included the benefit of approximately 13% from acquisitions specifically T-Mobile and AT&amp;T towers as well as the NextG acquisition.
For the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry for the first quarter of 2014 as shown on Slide 8 the sequential growth in site rental revenue from Q4 2013 to Q1 2014 includes the benefit of approximately $85 million of additional site rental revenue from the AT&amp;T towers.
This sequential growth in organic site rental revenue is muted by approximately $2 million less benefit from nonrecurring items than we had in the fourth quarter of 2013 iDEN-related churn of approximately $2 million in the first quarter and approximately $1 million from a lower-assumed Australian dollar to U.S.
dollar exchange rate.
Further AFFO in the first quarter includes $11 million of dividends on preferred stock related to the AT&amp;T tower financing and lower contribution from net prepaid rent of approximately $27 million than we had in the previous quarter.
Let me spend a minute walking through the changes that we included in our revised 2014 outlook as shown on Slides 9 and 10.
Our previous outlook which was issued on October 21 2013 included the expected operating results from the AT&amp;T tower transaction but not the related financing costs as such financings had not yet been completed.
The impact from the financing activities related to the AT&amp;T tower transaction includes $44 million in dividends from the 4.5% mandatory convertible preferred shares and $25 million of incremental interest associated with borrowings under the senior credit facility.
As such we anticipate the AT&amp;T towers will contribute approximately $176 million to $186 million to our 2014 AFFO inclusive of the aforementioned financing costs.
Further we have increased the midpoint of our full year 2014 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $20 million primarily reflecting the higher expected service gross margin contribution.
And we adjusted our 2014 outlook for AFFO to reflect the aforementioned financing costs and increased expectation for services.
With regards to site rental revenue we expect approximately $175 million to $185 million of organic cash revenue growth in 2014 ignoring the impact from straight-line revenue adjustments.
We expect this $175 million to $185 million of organic cash revenue growth to be comprised equally of new tenant activity and cash escalation.
As we noted in the press release we expect a 30% increase on a same-tower basis in new leasing activity in 2014 when compared to 2013.
Further we expect that only about 10% of our activity will be covered by the pre-sold leasing arrangements that we have discussed previously.
In addition our 2014 outlook includes the negative impact of churn of approximately $50 million or 2% of our site rental revenue.
In essence the cash revenue growth from our contracted lease escalations during the calendar year 2014 exceeds the expected impact from total churn.
Approximately half of the expected churn is typical churn activity and half is from Sprint decommissioning of their legacy Nextel iDEN network.
Based on Sprint's stated intention to decommission their iDEN network and our contractual terms with Sprint we expect approximately 3% of our run rate site rental revenues to be impacted by the iDEN decommissioning over time.
These iDEN leases have effective term end dates spread evenly throughout 2014 and 2015.
As a result we expect the reduction of site rental revenues from the iDEN decommissioning to be approximately 1% in 2014 with the remaining 2% impact coming after calendar year 2014.
With respect to 2014 adjusted EBITDA we anticipate that site rental direct expenses and G&amp;A on our existing portfolio of sites will grow approximately 1% from 2013 and the contribution from services gross margin will be approximately $15 million lower than the contribution we benefited from in 2013.
Further our forecast for 2014 AFFO is negatively impacted by approximately $17 million in expected sustaining capital expenditures to remodel and expand certain of our office facilities which we would not expect to recur in the foreseeable future.
As we previously announced we commenced operating at the REIT on January 1 2014 and expect to initiate a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share beginning this quarter.
Based on our expectation for growth in our business we believe that we can grow our dividend over the next 5 years by at least 15% annually while consuming the vast majority of our taxable net operating losses before the year 2020.
We ended 2013 with approximately $2.3 billion in tax net operating losses.
As shown on Slide 10 during 2014 we expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion of AFFO.
Based on our expected dividend payments and forecasted growth we expect to be able to continue to make significant investments with our cash flow in activities including investing in acquisition; the construction of new sites including small cell networks; land purchases and the purchase of our own security that we believe will maximize long-term AFFO per share.
Our long-standing approach to capital allocation combined with strong operating results has driven significant growth in AFFO per share.
In fact based on our 2014 outlook the compounded annual growth rate of AFFO per share from 2007 through our expectations for 2014 is in excess of 17%.
Importantly we have been able to produce this growth while positioning ourselves for future growth without increasing the risk profile of our business.
We believe our results reflect the value of the disciplined investments we've made over a long period of time through share purchases and U.S.
acquisitions and the industry-leading customer service we provide.
In summary we are excited about our leadership role in the -- in wireless infrastructure.
Our announced AT&amp;T transaction furthers our focus on the U.S.
market and expands our portfolio in the top 100 markets while increasing our expected growth rates of revenue and cash flow.
And I'm very excited about 2014 as we continue to execute around our core business and integrate the AT&amp;T towers into our portfolio.
Wrapping up my comments I'd like to thank Fiona for her nearly 7 years of managing the IR function at Crown Castle.
She has done a terrific job.
She's taking on another leadership role inside the company that begins next week.
Son Nguyen who is a VP in our Corporate Finance Group and has been with the company for nearly 5 years is assuming the IR role in her place.
And with that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
We obviously have a lot to cover at year end.
And I want to add my thanks to Fiona for 7 years of great work in the IR role.
And honestly we'll miss that refined Irish accent on these calls.
I want to take a couple minutes to reflect on the tremendous year we had on a number of fronts.
We accomplished a number of milestones in 2013 exceeding our financial targets for the year while continuing to execute on our strategic objective of growing our leadership position in the U.S.
market.
I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the significant accomplishments of our Crown Castle professionals as we successfully integrated the T-Mobile acquisition expanded our Small Cell business processed record application volumes associated with LTE upgrades and co-locations and gear [ph] our Services business by successfully meeting customer demand for installation and upgrade activities on our sites.
Since April of 2012 we have invested approximately $9 billion in acquisitions that we believe significantly enhance our portfolio and our position as the premier shared wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S with 40% more towers in the U.S.
than our nearest competitor and the largest small cell operator in the U.S.
Today with approximately 40 000 towers and over 11 000 small cell nodes in the U.S.
and a presence in all of the top 100 markets we have unmatched capability to efficiently accommodate wireless carrier demands for more sites to improve and enhance wireless networks.
We have enjoyed considerable success with past acquisitions and believe the result of our recent acquisitions will be no different.
As shown on Slide 11 we have proven over the short and long term that we are able to transact integrate lease and operate carrier assets in ways that create significant value having roughly quadrupled the initial yield on our legacy carrier portfolio assets.
These assets continue to increase their cash flow and resulting yields to this day.
Our transaction with AT&amp;T is the sixth wireless carrier portfolio transaction we've completed in the U.S.
I would also note that our T-Mobile transaction that we completed just over a year ago is tracking ahead of our original acquisition model.
Simply stated our strategy is to replicate the growth in site rental revenue and margin we've achieved on past transactions on these most recent additions to our portfolio.
We remain focused on the U.S.
market the largest and fastest-growing wireless market in the world where the ability of the wireless carriers to make a profitable investments is most apparent and barriers to entry remain high.
The U.S.
market is unique in that network quality continues to be a differentiator.
The strong correlation between network investment and low consumer churn necessitates the carriers to continue upgrading their wireless networks to improve network quality increase capacity and add functionality in order to remain competitive and grow.
As a result we are enjoying unprecedented levels of network upgrade activity as each of the 4 major wireless carriers are adding LTE coverage and capacity at the present time.
Additionally as shown on Slide 12 the U.S.
market is uniquely attractive to us due to its relative size and robustness compared to other markets.
Considering the country geopolitical currency and other risks associated with operating in international markets I believe the U.S.
market offers the most compelling risk-adjusted returns for capital investment in wireless infrastructure.
Further we are -- we believe the timing of the NextG T-Mobile and AT&amp;T acquisitions is fortuitous as network densification activity accelerates and we are well positioned to capture additional leasing revenue across our extensive urban-centric portfolio.
We have completed the integration of the T-Mobile towers and are fully engaged in integrating the newly acquired AT&amp;T towers.
And I would like to extend my appreciation to the staff and our friends at AT&amp;T who are assisting us with this orderly transition.
In fact carriers are already asking us to prioritize applications on our new AT&amp;T sites which we are working diligently to accomplish.
Moving on to small cells.
We continue to exceed our expectations as carriers augment capacity.
Our small cell networks offer similar co-location opportunities to towers.
And as we have stated in the past the returns we are seeing from our investment in small cells are similar to if not better than the returns from macro towers.
We continue to believe that small cells play an integral role in solving capacity and coverage issues in areas not traditionally served by macro tower sites.
In fact we have seen tremendous growth in our small cell network activity where we have more than doubled adjusted EBITDA since April of 2012 when we closed on the NextG transaction.
Today we have an extensive network of small cells with over 11 000 nodes and a robust pipeline of additional nodes to come.
Further we have rights to over 6 000 miles of fiber.
These nodes and fiber are in the largest most densely populated and highly demand -- highest demand markets such as Manhattan San Francisco Southern California Philadelphia and Boston to name a few.
We continue to expand our small cell networks meaningfully and we expect our investment in this area to be higher in 2014 with expected similar returns to what we've achieved in the past.
In addition to a strong year of site leasing our U.S.
Services business performed exceptionally well as we continue to capture more of the revenue opportunities associated with assisting our customers and locating on or upgrading installations on our sites.
This increase in services activity reflects the unprecedented activity we are seeing from all 4 major carriers as they upgrade to LTE and is attributable to the confidence our customers have in Crown Castle.
As regularly expressed in our customer surveys they consistently rank us as delivering the highest customer satisfaction in the industry.
Before I turn the call over for questions I would like to reiterate some of the strong fundamental trends in wireless that are continuing to drive our business.
While we were all very familiar with the growth in demand for constant mobile connectivity premised by our own increasing dependence on a variety of mobile devices thanks to the continued rollout of 4G LTE networks by all 4 major carriers mobile users are able to consume more data than ever.
While in the past the transition that drove this data consumption was from feature phones to smartphones now it's the upgrade path from low-end to high-end smartphones with each generation adding approximately 40% more traffic by device.
iPhone users consume almost twice the data per session than an average Android phone user consumes and the iPhone 4 4s and 5 held the top 3 places on the list of most data-hungry devices.
Amazingly Cisco reports that data consumption on mobile devices should surpass data consumption on traditional wired PCs by 2016.
In fact Verizon has said that it expects data traffic to grow by a factor of 6x to 7x over the next few years.
Further they've also announced they expect to launch Voice over LTE service this year acquiring existing networks to be 20% to 30% more dense for data compared to data-only LTE.
Finally as we look to the future the expanding LTE networks are expected to accelerate the growth of countless machine-to-machine applications including connected automobiles and wearable devices which represent a huge catalyst for future data consumption.
While connected cars and other machine-to-machine applications such as alarm-monitoring systems vehicle tracking consumer electronics smart grid solutions medical device alerts and a host of other new products play a very small role in today's environment such applications built for a mobile environment are an emerging reality and will require significant investment in wireless networks to ensure that there is sufficient network depth and capacity to accommodate even higher usage.
Needless to say we look forward to the future.
So in wrapping up let me conclude by saying we had a very busy and successful year and I can assure you we are geared up for another one in 2014.
We are in the midst of a very robust environment for wireless network growth as has been well-documented.
I want to thank our team for their accomplishments and look forward to reporting more of their successes to you in the future.
With that operator would you please turn the call over for questions? [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Mr.
Ric Prentiss from Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple of quick questions.
One Jay on the SG&amp;A in the quarter it seemed to jump up quite a bit.
Wondering if that had anything to do with the AT&amp;T transaction either special charges legal fees et cetera or is that kind of the new run rate we should expect going forward? Yes.
I think the movements you see -- part of it is that we staffed up for the AT&amp;T tower transaction as well as the integration process.
Some of it also is related to the higher level of services that we're seeing and I would expect that to be kind of our new run rate.
I would point out as I did in my prepared remarks if you look at the total cost structure for 2014 over 2013 net of the direct expenses that we'll get from the AT&amp;T tower transaction that our total costs look like they're going up about 1% on a like-for-like basis and that would include the additional G&amp;A that we would expect it include.
And I'm doing that on a cash basis and ignoring any stock-based comp that would be included in the G&amp;A numbers.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> In the past you've mentioned that certain percent of your SG&amp;A is really related to the Services business.
If the Services business drops down in some way obviously it's great today with it being so strong remind us again how much of the SG&amp;A could come out as Services business maybe comes down in say 1 or 2 years? Yes.
Ric we think conservatively at least half.
It may be more than that.
As you can imagine in our business most of the activity that we all work on has to do with the incremental activity rather than continuing to operate the base of leases that we've already put on the tower.
So we think it's at least half and it may be -- it might be more than that.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And then on the M&amp;A front we noticed the transaction in January from CPS in Texas I think.
Is that included in your guidance? I think it was a $41 million transaction and what other M&amp;A opportunities might there be in the U.S.
or is Europe of interest to you? It was included in our outlook and I'll let Ben kind of speak to more broadly internationally.
It was included in our outlook and from time to time we do see some smaller opportunities.
I talked about the financial flexibility that we think we have related to cash flow.
We have about $1.5 billion of cash flow in 2014 that we would expect to have about 1/3 of that being allocated to dividend about 1/3 of it to CapEx activities that look similar to what we've done in past years and that remaining 1/3 is open for us to invest in what we think maximizes long-term AFFO per share which could include acquisitions maybe some more land purchases opportunities that we see around the small cell space or buying back our own stock.
Yes.
In the AT&amp;T transaction as you saw how we paid for it we were very deliberate in not taking ourselves out of the market going forward.
We're pretty good at integrating assets.
We feel like while it's a lot of work in 2014 we certainly wanted to be in the marketplace as other assets would present themselves that would meet our criteria of adding growth and cash flow against our fallback position always is buying our own securities.
So Ric to your question we will continue and have lots of balance sheet capacity to look at other opportunities wherever they are.
You mentioned Western Europe.
Certainly that's something we would be interested in.
As you've seen us over the years we always look at it on a price versus sort of risk-reward basis and what the lease-up opportunity is against what we think is available in the U.S.
market or even more simply in our own securities.
So we have the capacity.
That was sized that way on purpose so that we did not take ourselves out of play and we feel very comfortable with where we are today.
And your next question will come from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> Yes.
I've got 2 questions.
First on spectrum given some of the auctions that are upcoming this year and then T-Mobile's purchase of 700 megahertz licenses how does that affect you in terms of potential incremental revenues with those overlays or are a lot of those overlay activities already contemplated in -- under the terms of your various carrier agreement? And then on the topic of small cells I was maybe interested in getting a sense of the opportunities that you see.
Is it primarily outdoor? Is it venue? Is it indoor? Maybe just a little bit more color to where you're seeing the leasing interest and where your investments are going to be focused? Sure Jon.
I'll take that.
This is Ben.
For the most part the additional activities we would expect for deploying additional spectrum is going to be incremental amendment revenue to us.
As we go forward that will typically be the case as we've sort of run near the end of the scope of these presold agreements as Jay mentioned in his prepared remarks.
So we would expect over time that would be an incremental source of revenue.
It's hard to put too fine a point in that in terms of what's in the guidance and what's not because it's an imperfect science.
What I will tell you is as we sit here in the third week of January we can see in our pipeline about half of 2014's leasing expectation and that's already in the pipeline and I would say that's about normal.
So we feel good about where we are.
We're starting off the year very strong.
And again I had a comment in the press release that we reiterated on this call we expect 30% up on same-tower basis leasing '14 versus '13.
So obviously that's moving and there's a lot going on in the marketplace.
With small cells we continue to see opportunities both outdoor and in indoor venues.
The venues by definition are going to be probably over time a smaller source of new incremental business for us.
It's just a smaller addressable market and universe but it is something we're pursuing.
It's something we're having success with.
But I would say the more significant opportunity where we're spending more capital today is on outdoor which is in highly dense population bases urban centers where you're essentially doing an underlay build strategy where macro sites have sort of gotten to their capacity.
And we're seeing as we mentioned in our comments very very good take up there in the market as the reality becomes more and more clear that there's just a lot of these markets where the cell density has to get to a point where it's so small that these are basically street light and telephone pole-type installations just in very very small cells where they're reusing the spectrum because of the capacity requirement in these markets.
So we remain very bullish and I think there's certainly a market on both indoor and outdoor but over time it looks to us like the outdoor is going to be significantly bigger.
Your next question will come from the line of Mr.
Philip Cusick from JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> This is Richard for Phil.
Just wanted to follow up on the iDEN side of in terms of the churn if it doesn't materialize in the worst-case scenario how should we think about guidance? Would it be more the bottom end of leasing revenue guidance coming up or could we see both the bottom and top end increase? Now Richard I think in part that depends on the timing of when that were to occur.
As I mentioned in my comments these iDEN leases come to their contractual term end dates during 2014 and 2015 spread evenly and so it's possible that ultimately we don't get to a point where we see a full 3% churn.
But that may occur in calendar year 2015 at which point it would have no impact on the outlook that we've given here.
And during the first quarter we saw an amount of churn that we -- that's in line with the outlook that we gave.
And so I think at this point I would just kind of leave it at that and then we'll have to update you as we move through the course of the year and see where ultimately they come out because the timing is important in terms of how much impact it would have.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And in terms of the services revenue I mean that's a big number last year and I think we're expecting some sort of falloff for this year.
What kind of changed over the past few months that gives you confidence that it seems like it's a pretty flat number this year versus down in some significant way? Well we're just continuing to execute for customers frankly and we're continuing to increase our market share the addressable opportunities around construction and preconstruction services in virtually every market area of the country that we operate in.
And so we're continuing to capture more of what's out there.
And as you know for years we've been conservative in how we guide and how we forecast that number.
We've never seen ourselves generating $200 million of service margin which is what we did almost in 2013.
Jay mentioned in our guidance we've haircut that $15 million.
If we outperform we'll outperform.
But there's a big opportunity out there in the market and we're -- we think it makes great strategic sense.
Not only are we making money doing it which is obviously a pretty good outcome but it also gives us a very high-touch experience in interacting with customers and their vendors so that we're very engaged in what their deployment plans and needs are.
It also gives us great control over the asset and what's going on at the asset.
And since we're the permanent owner of these 40 000 sites we are pretty interested in what's happening on the site and that's the way we maximize the outcome and the opportunity of co-locations over time on these towers.
So there's lots of great reasons for us to continue to do this and we're very very pleased with the outcome.
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen from Macquarie.
Based on the midpoint of your guidance it appears that the net impact of prepaid rent increases by just $3.5 million in 2014.
Given the increase we saw in Q4 why do you expect this to stabilize in 2014? Is it the AT&amp;T MLA that's sort of phasing out? Or is it something else? And then what do you think this will look like in 2015? Yes Kevin I think as we've talked about in the past prepaid rent is a function of a couple of different things.
It's a function of activity that we see around the network and how much investment is being made by the carriers.
And secondly it's based on how those carriers ultimately would like to structure their arrangements with us.
We have been very successful over the last several years of passing nearly all of the CapEx that we incur as we upgrade sites to hold additional tenants we've been able to pass that on to the carrier.
And so there's a bit of a pricing question there and a bit of a question around activity.
I think similar to Ben's comments that he made around Services I think we will have been and will continue to be a bit conservative as we think about forecasting prepaid -- the prepaid rent that we receive.
But thus far we've done very well at that.
And I would point out we get a lot of questions and it seems like this topic has been a bit of a hot one over the last couple of years as people have tried to figure out components of cash and noncash revenue.
And when you look out total site rental revenue our guide for 2014 is nearly $3 billion of site rental revenue.
And the noncash component after you work through all the puts and takes is less than $10 million on a $3 billion revenue number.
And so I think we're happy to talk about it.
I think we've talked about it in great detail.
At a really high level the GAAP numbers our reported numbers are very similar to what we're seeing in terms of cash running through the income statement.
And our focus has been as we think about cash flow per share and the way that we operate the business we're really focused on what is the cash outcome? And so as we think about the relationships with the carriers as well as how we operate the business we drive it all the way down to the cash level.
And today as I look forward to 2014 the differences between sort of cash and noncash items and everything by the time they all wash out is basically the same.
And just a quick follow-up.
Your guidance assumes kind of based on historical quarter-over-quarter growth kind of a deceleration from Q1 to Q4.
Is this just the impact of the iDEN churn phasing in or are you just being conservative here? I think I mentioned a couple of the items that are impacting that sequential growth.
It is the iDEN a bit of it would be FX and then another portion of it would be as we talk about the onetime items moving from quarter to quarter.
And over the course of the year I'm assuming as you think about the rest of the quarters throughout 2014 you have a similar dynamic at play as you look forward [indiscernible].
What are you seeing on Clearwire the 2.5 build at this point from Sprint? We're seeing a bunch of applications service revenue opportunity not a real significant revenue in terms of site rental recurring revenue for the most part but very significant opportunity to facilitate their installation.
And again we're talking about on existing sites.
We expect over time to have capacity upgrades and infill sites coming from Sprint and T-Mobile for that matter.
Right now just to characterize the market for 2014 we're seeing a very significant amount of co-location activity with Verizon and AT&amp;T as they've announced their desire to add sites to their network.
Still in the process of the initial build if you will and finishing that up at the Sprint and T-Mobile level.
But we fully expect over time to see more infill sites from Sprint and T-Mobile as their network demands require but that's kind of [indiscernible].
So that's your upside case is revenue recognition from Sprint and T-Mobile in '14? I think so.
As they move into the site sort of infill process that seems to run through the marketplace that's likely where we see the next wave of demand coming.
But I don't want any way to diminish what we see this year already.
There's a big pipeline out there.
It's not insignificant.
To tell you guys in January we expect to do 30% more on a same-tower basis.
That's movement around here.
Your next question will come from Michael Rollins from Citi.
Research Division</strong> Was wondering the $180 million of new revenue that you're expecting for 2014 did that include the impact from the AT&amp;T tower acquisition? And whether it does or doesn't can you give us a sense of the contributions you're looking for in terms of growth from that portfolio during 2014? Sure Mike.
On the $180 million it includes the leasing that we would expect to happen on those AT&amp;T sites but it doesn't include any revenue that was on the sites when we acquired them.
So it would be all organic growth during calendar year 2014 and it would be a combination of the brand-new either leases that go on-site the amendment to existing leases as well as cash escalators.
So it's a cash number that would be done on anything that's added to a site it would not include anything that was acquired if you will.
In terms of our assumption on the AT&amp;T sites relative to the rest of the portfolio we assumed a similar level of leasing on those AT&amp;T sites.
Our assumption is that over time as we've talked about we think it will be growth enhancing to our site rental revenue growth rate these new assets because of the way they've been operated in the past.
And Ben spoke about some of the early indications that we have in terms of customer desire.
So we may do a little bit better than at a like level of leasing but that was basically our assumption going into calendar year 2014.
Obviously it will take us a bit of time to get those assets completely integrated to get them into all of our systems to get all of the documents necessary in order to facilitate customers co-locating on these sites at the same rate at which we can typically do that on legacy Crown sites.
I would tell you from past experiences it takes us probably 6 to 8 months to kind of get most of the sites up and running to where we're operating at that level.
And I'm sure there are a whole lot of our folks listening to this call this morning who are doing everything they can to make that happen faster than that but that's the typical reality.
Research Division</strong> And just a point of clarification on that.
I think in your guidance commentary you described the effect of or your expectation for $2 million of less nonrecurring revenue in 1Q '14 over 4Q '13.
Can you describe to us what the nonrecurring benefit was specifically in the fourth quarter of '13? Sure.
Typically when we go into any -- typically in any quarter we have about $4 million to $5 million of items that relate to -- that are nonrecurring items that flow through site rental revenue.
We have those in almost every quarter and they relate to all kinds of things.
A common example would be a tenant that had installed equipment on the site without notifying the tower operator and that happens from time to time.
So we end up collecting back rent that would be owed to us as a result of that.
And so the sort of $4 million to $5 million that we always put into the expectation moving from quarter to quarter.
And we had in the fourth quarter about $7 million.
So we had about $2 million of I would say above the run rate.
It's also something that we typically find after we do acquisitions.
And so we might find a bit of that but our working assumption for first quarter was we went back to kind of that normalized level.
If we normalize that for the fourth quarter maybe this is the follow-on question if we normalize that for the fourth quarter we kind of still came out at the high end or maybe slightly above the high end of our previously expected guide for the fourth quarter with regards to site rental revenue.
Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> Just 2 if I could guys.
From time to time you kind of give us a few mile markers on scoping out the size of the small cell opportunity.
We've been talking about it being a strong grower how the EBITDA has kind of doubled over the year.
But if you could give us some kind of numbers to get a sense of how big a contributor it is now and kind of we can do the math on what is contributing at the margin it would be super helpful.
And then second just Jay obviously we're starting the dividend program now.
There's obviously questions about how the NOLs are going to feather in through this process.
You've talked about 15% dividend growth.
But on the other hand of it I think earlier you also talked about how stock buybacks are also potentially a use of capital in your hierarchy of maximizing returns.
So could you kind of put dividends now somewhere in that hierarchy? Are dividends a better way to return capital to investors or are you considering it a less good way and stock buybacks are the preferred method now? Dave I'll take the first on small cell.
Today it's about 5% of adjusted EBITDA okay? Punching above its weight though.
It's growing more than its proportional 5% and that's what happens if you look at how did you grow double EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA since April of 2012.
So in less than 2 years we've doubled it.
We have a lot people working very hard on co-location and new builds on the small cell networks.
And as we mentioned the fiber is obviously the very valuable asset that we have there.
We spent about $180 million or so last year on that and we expect to spend somewhat more than that.
I can't tell you exactly it obviously depends on the pipeline and the pace at which it goes.
About 1/3 of our prepaid rent or if you will is related to those the construction activities around the small cell networks that's what we've said before and that continued in 2013.
But look we're very pleased.
This is -- it's absolutely the tower model in terms of a shared infrastructure.
There's benefit to the carriers for going on the existing systems.
It's a lot about speed and ease.
And I hate to say ease because these are complicated transactions to actually get constructed and built.
But to the extent you've already got the dedicated fiber in the hubs it's something where we can facilitate turning up capacity for a carrier much quicker than pretty much any other alternative in these major markets and that's becoming quite an accepted fact.
And so we're seeing the continued growth in that.
And we're going to continue.
We think this will continue for some time.
It's a great way to add capacity in these markets and we're very very pleased with the business we acquired and have now grown and with the team we have dedicated to it.
Dave on your second question around capital allocation as we've talked about there are merits of increasing the dividend at a rate faster than what we've talked about of increasing it by about 15% or at least 15% per annum as we go through the process of utilizing the full extent of our taxable -- our tax net operating losses.
At a pace of about 15% growth in our net operating losses growth in dividend and against the net operating losses that would as I mentioned in my comments earlier exhaust the net operating losses by 2020.
And I think we'll just have to see what opportunities are in front of us at the dates ahead.
And to the extent that we find opportunities either to invest in the stock or buy other assets we may stay on that pace of 15%.
To the extent that we don't see opportunities that meet our risk-adjusted returns then we might look to increase the dividend at a pace higher than that 15%.
But I think it's impossible as we sit here today to make the judgment about what that will look like in the future.
I think if we struck the -- thought about the various balances of beginning a dividend we thought it was an appropriate amount of a dividend about roughly $1.40 per share in the first year out of the gate of starting the dividend making up about 1/3 of the cash flow it gave us plenty of cash to continue to make opportunistic investments.
We were smart I think about the way we thought about the capital structure and overall leverage though as Ben mentioned earlier in his comments we're able to continue to be competitive and look for assets that we think fit in the portfolio nicely and drive long-term returns.
And at the same time start a process of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends which we believe gives us an opportunity to expand the investor base and start to build on a base of investors that ultimately will be a larger portion of our investor base in all likelihood.
Long term if we think about the cash flow in the business it's likely that we'll be distributing once the NOLs are completely exhausted we'll likely be distributing 75% to 80% of the cash flow in the business.
And obviously that's an exciting day for us once that comes about.
But in the short term we certainly have a lot of cash and a lot of flexibility.
And to the extent that there are investments there that meet the risk-adjusted returns we're happy to make those.
And if we don't see them then we'll come back and look to return a greater percentage of the cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividend.
Research Division</strong> If I could just follow up real quick on just one thing on the services revenue.
You guys have been very successful with that services revenue segment.
The market seems to put -- view it as a less high-quality business and I guess most businesses are less high quality than the tower business.
But I think the market struggles to figure out whether this is a bubble in this business and it's going to pop and this is something we need to model going back down to rates that were more reflective of the market 3 or 4 years ago or is this a business that has just simply grown? It's a bigger business today.
It's going to stay a bigger business.
Crown is a bigger player in this business.
How do we think about this business as a business on a go-forward basis? Yes.
Dave there's -- the business has certainly grown.
I mean obviously with 4 carriers actively engaged in adding LTE and then further capacity the business on the opportunity of the market has grown.
I would quickly add we have grown our capabilities dramatically in this area.
We've added a number of resources and we've frankly gotten a lot better at it and we've expanded the scope of what we do over time.
Everything from preconstruction work zoning permitting all the way through managing the construction process at the end.
I think each shareholder and analyst will need to come to their own conclusion about this.
As we look at it as management strategically it makes a lot of sense as I talked about earlier.
From a valuation perspective I think Ric's question at the beginning is very germane here.
And if you want to think about it it plateauing or even headed down over time that's certainly everybody's purview to take a haircut if they want to and say "Okay what's kind of the recurring base run rate of that activity in a more normalized market?" I think that's certainly a logical approach.
The only thing I would add to that is that it's important to then think about what's the sustaining level of G&amp;A we would have to have and that's somewhat of a mitigating factor as you go to start haircutting the gross margin contribution from that.
Where to tell you to take that I think I'm going to leave that for everybody to make their own best guess because obviously we're going 24/7 around here working on the services business.
We think it drives leasing and obviously control and protection of the asset.
So we're going to keep doing it and the market can do the best they can to put a value on it with these caveats I've mentioned around it's important to think about the G&amp;A component.
Your next question will come from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I was hoping you could touch on the AT&amp;T T-Mobile acquisitions in particular the reserve space on the towers.
If these towers are 1.6 1.7 tenants each and then there's reserve space how much upside is left there? And also is this driving some of the prepaid rent? And then the other question is with press reports talking about the market going from 4 to 3 carriers can you remind us some of the prior consolidations and the impact they had on your business? Sure.
I'll take the first part.
As we go through the various transactions with the most 2 recent you mentioned with T-Mobile and AT&amp;T and the reserve loading or reserve capacity that they have on those towers the way to think about that in simplistic terms is they've essentially got the reserve capacity with limitations at the current RAD center that they're operating at today.
And so the historical experience which we would expect it to play out again in the future is over a period of about 3 years we shouldn't expect any additional amendment revenue associated with adding equipment from those anchored carriers in the case of T-Mobile and AT&amp;T here that we're talking about on those existing RAD centers over a period of about 3 years.
After that it's been our experience and the carriers' experience that they exhaust that reserve capacity and they're back asking for additional capacity whether it be on the same RAD center or a different RAD center which is not covered by the reserve capacity which is obviously an additional revenue opportunity.
And in both of those transactions we provided as part of the transaction a rate card if you will pricing that additional capacity and what we would charge for that.
So that's part and parcel of those transactions.
And our historical experience is it's about 3 years before you see them come back -- that would result in additional revenue beyond that reserve capacity.
But the most important take away is it's basically limited to that existing RAD center at that level.
So it doesn't encumber our ability then to co-locate additional tenants on the site and we've been obviously very good at that over the last 14 years and we'd expect to continue to do that.
With regards to your second question and I'm assuming you're referencing the recent rumors around Sprint combination with T-Mobile.
We've released some of the statistics there.
The overlap of those sites represent if half of the equipment were to be removed that would represent about 10% of our consolidated revenues today.
Those leases have approximately 7 years remaining on them.
So from today through when we would actually begin to see that if the combination were to happen and if sites were to begin to be taken down we'd be about 7 years from now to that date.
I think our typical experience has been and you can certainly rewind the clock and look at the timing of when Sprint acquired the Nextel network and the iDEN network we're just now experiencing that many years later well beyond the 7-year timeline.
So a lot -- there's a lot of variables.
I think our experience has been a relatively small amount of churn that we ultimately see in consolidation.
And I think the broader point which we have talked extensively about over the years about the consolidations is that the best thing for us as a tower company is to have carriers that have spectrum and have significant cash flow and strong financial position.
And to the extent that they are able to deliver strong financial returns from incremental investment in capital and are not susceptible to changes in the market in order to raise that capital for investment we do very well as a tower business.
And Ben spoke to one of the earlier questions around spectrum and the long-term prospects of additional spectrum being in the hands of the operators and having carriers that are in a strong financial position I think net-net over the years consolidation has been a very good thing for our industry.
And while the churn conversation in the sites lost we certainly have reconciled that on the positive side in terms of what it meant around revenue growth and additional revenues that we receive on sites today that -- we believe that number far outweighs any of the downside that we've seen from the loss of some of the churn that has happened over time.
Your next question will come from the line of Michael Bowen from Pacific Crest.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
I wanted to get one point of clarification.
With T-Mobile and Sprint builds did you say you do have some of the 4G LTE builds for them built into the guidance or not? Second question around the EBITDA increase in '14 or the adjusted EBITDA increase in '14 sorry if I missed it wanted to see where that was coming from.
And then on small cells finally do you view this activity as sustainable over the years or do you think this is a near-term spike over the next couple of years as the carriers densify their networks? Yes.
I think in terms of your first question around T-Mobile and Sprint build our leasing activity assumes that we'll see good lease-up activity across the board from all of the carriers.
If I'm understanding your question correctly you're speaking to the lease-up and not necessarily the construction of new towers.
We're building very few brand-new towers across the portfolio but we are assuming that we'll see lease-up and additional leasing activity from T-Mobile Sprint Verizon and AT&amp;T.
And they make up the vast majority of our revenue growth expectation.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And real quickly with that does that include the -- any assumptions for the 700 MHz A Block that T-Mobile [indiscernible]? I think that to the extent something happens there that will likely be beyond calendar year 2014 in terms of what we would see impacting our results.
So I would say maybe you'd see some of that in terms of lease activity as we go towards the end of the year but I don't think that would be a meaningful contributor to the site rental revenues in the calendar year.
On the second question around adjusted EBITDA increase we did increase our assumption by approximately $20 million.
Most of that is coming from the services expectation increasing our services expectation for 2014 from where we had previously issued the guidance.
We did take up the low end of the range on site rental revenue and site rental gross margin.
So there is $2 million to $3 million of higher contribution from the site rental revenue and site rental gross margin in terms of that increase in that $20 million increase in adjusted EBITDA.
So it's about $17 million or so from services and then the balance coming from site rental.
Your last question on the sustainability of the small cell network we certainly believe it is sustainable.
We're signing long-term agreements just as we are in the tower -- on the tower side and we have a vast market out there of capacity challenged high sort of urban dense-type markets.
It's only continuing to get more and more challenged as we all put more devices on these networks.
So we certainly think this is a very long-term phenomenon and these are permanent installations.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And are those contract terms as long as the other contracts? Yes.
Yes.
Looks very similar.
We have time for one more I think.
Probably ran overtime a little bit today.
So your final question will come from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.
LLC Research Division</strong> Your guidance for site rental revenue implies about a $473 million increase off of the actuals in 2013.
And when I go through the different components I'm just having a little trouble figuring it out.
So you're assuming $175 million to $185 million.
I've got $180 million about half of that for escalators about half for new leases which includes amendments.
And then I think you've told us in the past that AT&amp;T is going to generate about $400 million of revenue.
So that's $580 million and then if I was to subtract out $50 million for the churn I get back down to $530 million.
So I'm just trying to figure out what the delta is between the $473 million and the $530 million.
I think it has to do with GAAP versus cash revenue but I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on that.
And then I have one other question after that.
Sure.
You have correctly identified the GAAP there.
It is related to the -- how we book and are required to book under the accounting terms our lease portfolio.
So most -- the vast majority of our tenant leases that are on our towers have fixed escalators.
The rate is stated in terms of 3% 4% et cetera and we straight line over the term of the lease the revenue.
So in a simple example if a lease had -- was $100 and had a 5% escalator for a 2-year period of time.
In the first year cash would be $100 in the second year cash would be $105.
So cash would have grown by 5 year-over-year.
But from a presentation in our financial statement it would look like site rental revenues of $102.5 for each of the 2 years.
In the first year...
LLC Research Division</strong> So of the $180 million roughly $90 million for escalators and the majority of the delta between the $470 million and the $530 million is in that aspect of the number? That's exactly right Colby.
Almost all of the $90 million almost all of the $90 million would already in essence already be straight-lined through the site rental revenue number.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then you mentioned 30% new lease revenue growth and you mentioned on the third quarter call and you called that out today.
Is that simply to take the $90 million of new leases and I guess that was $70 million roughly in '13 and now it's $90 million and that equates to roughly 30% growth.
Is that when you say 30% growth the absolute numbers that you're referencing? You're mostly there.
The one thing I would add is that we're doing this on a same-tower basis.
So you can't take the absolute nominal dollars which we're going to benefit by owning nearly another 10 000 assets as a result of our AT&amp;T tower transaction.
So we're looking at it on a site-by-site basis and basically saying the amount of additional revenue we'll add from adding additional tenants to towers on a same-store basis or same-tower basis that number is up 30% year-over-year.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just a quick follow-up -- my quick follow-up question was you noted $18 million of revenue for the AT&amp;T towers in the fourth quarter.
That's roughly 15 days.
And if I simply divide that out and then multiply that by 365 it actually implies on an annualized basis that for those 18 days the AT&amp;T towers generated $438 million of revenue versus your guidance of roughly $400 million.
Could you just explain to me why I might be off or why I shouldn't be assuming a much greater number for AT&amp;T revenue in 2014? Yes.
It does imply if you look at -- I would point you more towards the site rental gross margin because there will be some impact in terms of as we talked about it when we gave the guidance we were referring to what the cash flow cash benefit was from the AT&amp;T towers.
And it certainly appears based on our early review that we may have been a bit conservative as we underwrote the assets in terms of our assumption of what run rate cash flows coming off of those assets are.
So we may have some -- we may have gained some benefit on that given our conservative assumptions as we underwrote the asset.
LLC Research Division</strong> And does the guidance still assume that conservative assumption or if you have -- or have you adjusted that? We have not adjusted that.
All right.
I think we're going to wrap up.
I appreciate everybody hanging with us a little long today as we did a full year wrap up and acquisition and quarter discussions and look forward to having a great year in 2014 and reporting to you on more of our successes.
So thanks and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the conference call for today.
Thank you for participating and please disconnect your lines.
Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by.

Thanks Son and good morning everyone.
We executed another great quarter in Q1 2014 exceeding the high end of our previously issued outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
As you can see on Slide 3 the strong results from site rental and network services coupled with our recent financing activities allow us to increase our outlook for full year 2014.
In addition to achieving great results in Q1 we had a very productive quarter on many other fronts.
First at the beginning of the year we achieved a significant milestone as we began operating as a REIT and subsequently paid our first common stock dividend in March.
Further since the beginning of the year we have refinanced $2.6 billion of debt extending our average debt maturity and lowering our overall cost of debt.
Also during the quarter we made significant progress integrating the AT&amp;T towers the integration of which we expect to be substantially complete by the fall of this year.
Turning to Slide 4.
During the first quarter site rental revenue increased from $615 million to $747 million representing a year-over-year growth of 21%.
On an organic basis before nonrenewals and adjusting for the impact of acquisitions FX material onetime items and straight-line accounting site rental revenues increased by $47 million an increase of approximately 8% compared to the same period a year ago.
Excluded from the organic growth rate is the onetime benefit of $5 million from a customer contract termination payment from Revol Wireless during the quarter.
The contract related to site leases for Revol a regional carrier in Ohio that ceased operations earlier this year.
Revol previously generated annual site rental revenue of approximately $4 million.
Excluding the benefit of this onetime item we were at the high end of our Q1 outlook for site rental revenues.
Of our approximately 8% organic growth the cash escalations in our customer contracts contributed approximately 3% and new leasing activity contributed approximately 5%.
This new leasing activity was driven almost entirely by the Big 4 wireless carriers with 85% of the growth coming from new tenant installations and the remaining portion from amendments to existing tenants.
As a part of the new leasing activity we are continuing to see very strong demand for our small cell networks.
At the end of the first quarter we had nearly 12 000 small cell nodes and over 6 000 miles of fiber.
The contribution to site rental revenue from our small cell networks is up approximately 20% year-over-year.
For the quarter nonrenewal of tenant leases reaching their contractual term end dates inclusive of Sprint's iDEN decommissioning was in line with our expectations.
Moving on to Slide 5.
Site rental gross margin increased $81 million to $519 million up 19% from the first quarter of 2013.
Site rental gross margin percentage is lower by approximately 175 basis points year-over-year as we closed on the AT&amp;T tower transaction which had an average tenancy of 1.7 tenants and therefore lower margins when compared to our legacy assets with approximately 3 tenants.
However the organic incremental margins were in excess of 90% at the high end of our historical average and reflective of the high operating leverage of the tower business model.
In the absence of additional acquisitions we expect to see our site rental gross margins expand as carriers add equipment to our sites.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% driven by the inclusion of the AT&amp;T towers an increase in site rental gross margin and strong performance of our network services business and offset to a small degree by increased G&amp;A which was up about 8% year-over-year.
This increase in G&amp;A includes the effect of increased staffing to manage our T-Mobile and AT&amp;T tower transactions which increased our tower portfolio by nearly 75% and the significant growth of our small cell networks.
AFFO was $349 million compared to $263 million from a year ago an increase of 33%.
On a per share basis AFFO was up 17% increasing from $0.90 per share to $1.05 per share.
As mentioned in our press release last night we have updated our AFFO definition to reflect the benefit of prepaid rent from customers over the life of customer contracts rather than the period in which the prepaid rent was received.
We believe the change will enhance comparability between us and our tower peers as we highlight the significant and growing cash flow of our -- our business produces.
Obviously the change to the AFFO definition does not change our cash flow profile or our investment capacity.
Under the previous definition of AFFO we would have exceeded the midpoint of our Q1 outlook by approximately $25 million.
With respect to how the change in the definition is likely to affect our AFFO results our AFFO will be lower initially because the cash received from prepaid rent in the current period is significantly greater than the amortization of prepaid rent received in prior periods.
This is primarily due to the fact that we have increased our portfolio of towers and small cell networks significantly over the last several years.
Assuming no additional acquisitions and similar levels of leasing activity we would expect the amount of prepaid rent and amortization of prepaid rent to converge over time.
Turning to investments and financing activities as shown on Slide 6.
Since the beginning of the year we refinanced or extended the maturities on $2.6 billion of our debt.
In the first quarter of 2014 we extended the maturities on $1.8 billion of our Term Loan B by 2 years.
Further earlier this month we closed on an 8-year $850 million senior notes offering with a coupon of 4.875%.
Proceeds from the offering will be used to refinance $800 million of existing debt that has a weighted average coupon of approximately 6%.
After giving effect to the aforementioned notes offering our current weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.2% with a weighted average maturity of 6 years.
Our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.4x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense is 4.2x.
We expect to continue to de-lever through growth in adjusted EBITDA trending towards approximately 5x debt to adjusted EBITDA.
During the first quarter we invested $143 million in capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $20 million in our land lease purchase program.
During the quarter we extended 340 land leases on our sites by an average of approximately 26 years.
The extension activity impacted consolidated recurring cash ground lease expense by approximately 20 basis points.
Additionally we purchased land beneath approximately 130 of our towers during the quarter.
As of today we own or control for more than 20 years land under towers representing 72% of our site rental gross margin.
In fact today approximately 1/3 of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own.
Where we have ground leases the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years.
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we look to protect our assets and control our largest operating expense.
We have provided more information regarding our ground interest activity in our supplemental information package that we referenced last night in our press release.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we invested $11 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $111 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures the latter consisting of $75 million on existing sites and $36 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell construction activity.
We had no meaningful acquisitions of towers in the first quarter.
Further during the quarter we paid our first quarterly common stock dividend of $0.35 per share or $117 million in aggregate.
Also during the quarter we purchased $21 million of common shares at an average price of $74 per share.
Moving on to the 2014 outlook as shown on Slide 7.
Based on our first quarter results our expectations of continued strong activity from the carriers for the remainder of the year and our recent financing activities we've increased our full year 2014 outlook for site rental revenues site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $11 million $9 million $26 million and $28 million respectively at the midpoint.
As shown on Slide 8 the midpoint of our 2014 outlook for site rental revenues implies growth of 19% or approximately $480 million compared to full year 2013.
On an organic basis before nonrenewals our outlook implies revenue growth of approximately 9% year-over-year at the midpoint.
The 9% is comprised of approximately 5% from new leasing activity and approximately 4% from escalations on existing customer lease contracts.
Compared to the first quarter of 2014 our outlook assumes a 15% increase in quarterly new leasing activity for the remainder of 2014.
Our 2014 outlook for site rental revenues also includes the negative impact of nonrenewals of approximately 2% of site rental revenues.
Approximately half of the nonrenewal impact is expected to come from Sprint's decommissioning of their legacy iDEN network and the remainder is expected to come from typical nonrenewal activity.
Based on Sprint's stated intention to decommission their iDEN network and our contractual terms at Sprint we believe approximately 3% of our run rate site rental revenues will be impacted by the iDEN network decommissioning.
This iDEN leases have effective term end dates spread evenly throughout 2014 and 2015.
With respect to 2014 adjusted EBITDA our increased outlook implies 16% growth year-over-year and reflects the previously mentioned increase in site rental gross margin and higher expected services gross margin contribution.
While the increases in staffing cost are a headwind to this growth in the short term we believe the investment will allow us to maximize and execute on our leading portfolio of assets over the long run.
As presented on Slide 9 after adjusting our previously provided full year 2014 outlook for AFFO from January for the updated definition on an apples-to-apples basis our new outlook increases AFFO guidance by $28 million at the midpoint.
Our increased AFFO reflects the increase in our outlook for adjusted EBITDA and from interest savings from our recent financing activities offset by an increase in sustaining capital expenditures related to additional office facilities.
On a per share basis our 2014 outlook implies AFFO growth of 11% before considering the benefit of the investment of our cash flows and after the 1% drag from additional office facility CapEx.
For the full year 2014 we believe we will generate $425 million to $525 million in discretionary investment capacity.
I'd like to spend just a minute to describe the sequential impact to the second quarter of 2014 from certain onetime or seasonal items.
Our second quarter growth is impacted by the previously mentioned onetime $5 million benefit from Revol's termination payment in Q1.
Additionally as is typical when going from the first quarter to the second quarter and warmer weather repair and maintenance quarter-to-quarter is higher by $3 million.
Further on an AFFO basis sustaining capital expenditures for the second quarter is expected to be higher by $11 million which includes the additional office facilities I spoke to a moment ago versus the first quarter of 2014.
Moving back to the high level consistent with our full year outlook the positive industry backdrop which Ben will speak to really supports our belief that there is a long runway of site rental revenue growth as the wireless operators continue to expand and improve their networks.
Given the high operating leverage of the business we believe our organic site rental revenue growth can translate into meaningful organic AFFO growth before considering the benefit of investments that we can make from the significant and growing cash flows generated by our business.
These investments include acquisitions; construction of new sites including small cell networks; land purchases; and the purchases of our own security that we believe will further enhance long-term AFFO per share growth.
Our longstanding approach to capital allocation combined with strong execution has driven significant growth in AFFO per share which we believe is a good measure of our ability to pay and grow our dividends over a long -- over the long term.
Importantly we believe we will be able to produce this growth without increasing the risk profile of our business.
In summary we are focused on total shareholder returns comprised of growth in dividends and AFFO per share.
As we have said previously we expect to grow our dividends to common shareholders by at least 15% per year over the next 5 years and continue to see significant growth in AFFO per share.
Lastly before I turn the call over to Ben I'd like to point out that we have posted to our website along with our earnings release a new supplemental information package.
The supplemental information package is a part of our goal to continue to enhance our communication and disclosure practices.
Many of the metrics I spoke to today are reconciled or presented in further detail on the supplemental package.
We believe the supplemental information package will be a useful tool that will assist investors in understanding and evaluating our business model and overall performance.
And with that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on this call on this busy reporting morning.
As Jay just walked you through the first quarter was another great quarter exceeding the high end of outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
Given the level of activity that we are seeing we are excited about the balance of the year.
Our current application pipeline leads us to expect new leasing activity per quarter for the remainder of the year to be approximately 15% higher compared to the level we experienced in the first quarter 2014.
This level of activity combined with our excellent first quarter results allows us to raise our 2014 outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
As all 4 major wireless carriers continue to invest in their networks for LTE and capacity enhancement I'm excited about the prospects of sustainable long-term growth over the next several years.
This is particularly true given our position as the leading shared wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S.
nearly 40 000 towers and 12 000 small cell nodes in operation.
As shown on Slide 10 we have a long track record of execution and growth through various cycles whether it be macroeconomic or industry-specific cycles.
Through this period of 14 years we have delivered strong organic growth as well as growth through disciplined capital allocation.
As you can see from these results we are committed to a long-term focus that delivers significant value over time.
With our industry-leading portfolio of assets and capabilities in the U.S.
we expect to continue this track record in the most dynamic growth market for wireless.
Over the last 2 years we've invested approximately $9 billion in acquisitions executing on our strategic objectives to expand our U.S.
portfolio of towers and small cells.
Turning to Slide 11.
We believe that these recent acquisitions provide us with opportunities to grow shareholder value through execution similar to the acquisitions we have made in the past.
Quite simply our strategy is to replicate the performance of our legacy assets with our recent acquisitions.
Tower assets that we have owned and operated for more than 10 years currently yield 15% on total invested capital representing significant shareholder value creation when compared to the initial yields at the time of purchase of approximately 4% to 5% similar to our recent acquisitions.
I believe our strategy will continue to prove successful given our investment in our people processes and assets which are focused on enabling carriers to meet the demand for wireless services.
We believe our recent acquisitions of small cell networks and towers were well-timed as network investments by carriers continue unabated.
As carriers continue to invest in their networks consumers and businesses have quickly absorbed the capacity added by the carriers.
Consumers and businesses continue to innovate and develop new applications and devices that will take advantage of the mobile Internet.
This has led to a reinforcing cycle of investment by the carriers and increased usage by the end consumers.
During 2013 Cisco's annual report on mobile data traffic reported that U.S.
mobile data consumption grew 75% over 2012.
Cisco projects that between 2013 and 2018 mobile data traffic even after accounting for Wi-Fi offloading will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 50% or an 8x increase in the next 5 years.
This growth in usage can be seen in all of our everyday lives.
The convenience and accessibility of mobile devices made smartphones and tablets the dominant channel for Internet consumption and changing the way we live work and play.
For businesses mobile Internet is changing the way companies operate innovate and compete.
There are mountains of positive statistics and trends about mobile Internet usage and I'd like to highlight just a few.
From an entertainment perspective a majority of consumers believe mobile devices will replace traditional televisions as the most common way to consume television shows and movies in the next 8 years.
A separate survey confirms that this trend is well underway with smartphones' screen time already outpacing TV screen time today.
Further Cisco reports that video already represents 50% of mobile Internet traffic and is projected to continue to grow at a 55% compound annual growth rate over the next 5 years.
As it relates to health 95 million Americans are currently using mobile phones as health tools.
The mobile health industry or mHealth is projected to grow 15x by 2018 to reach $20 billion of value as wireless technology has proven to increase efficiency and improve results.
Remote patient monitoring is projected to save Americans $36 billion in health care cost by 2018.
And terms such as the Internet of Things or the Connected Life have been coined to describe the machine-to-machine connectivity that we're already seeing.
Today there are approximately 10 billion connected devices ranging from GPS location devices to thermostats to smart meters.
This number is projected to increase to 30 billion devices by 2020.
Cisco further projects that mobile data traffic created by these devices will increase 68-fold by 2018 driven by increased penetration of technologies such as connected cars and smart-wearable devices.
To meet this growing demand carriers are investing in their networks.
And to effectively build out their networks carriers need economic incentive spectrum and infrastructure like we provide.
When it comes to economic incentive we believe the U.S.
market has the largest and the fastest-growing wireless market in the world provides a landscape for the ability of the wireless carriers to make profitable investment its most apparent and barriers to entry remain high.
As shown on Slide 12 the U.S.
market is uniquely attractive due to its relative size and robustness compared to other markets.
Strong unit economics with average ARPUs greater than $50 a month combined with high correlation between network investment and low consumer churn has led carriers to continue to upgrade their networks to improve network quality increase capacity and add functionality in order to remain competitive and grow.
As a result we would expect current network upgrade and densification activity by the 4 major wireless carriers to continue for quite some time.
On the spectrum front there's approximately 600 megahertz of spectrum in the hands of carriers and potential entrants including LightSquared DISH and FirstNet.
Of this 600 megahertz approximately 350 megahertz is actually deployed and is currently being used by consumers.
That leaves another approximately 250 megahertz to be deployed depending upon the market.
Some of this spectrum including Sprint's 2.5 T-Mobile's 700 megahertz and Verizon's AWS represent near-term to intermediate-term opportunities for Crown Castle.
Other spectrum primarily held by LightSquared DISH and FirstNet represents longer-term opportunities.
Additionally the FCC has proposed freeing up another approximately 150 megahertz over the next several years.
It's possible that over the next decade the total amount of spectrum deployed could double a positive for Crown Castle as additional spectrum has historically led to additional equipment being deployed on our sites.
Before I turn the call over for questions I think it's instructive to compare the current 4G deployment cycle with the 3G deployment cycle that we're familiar with.
3G was initially deployed in 2002 and continued through 2009 to 2010 time frame when 4G deployments began.
Based on the 3G cycle we believe that we are still in the early innings of the 4G investment cycle.
Verizon and AT&amp;T initially led the way with 4G and currently they are focused on network densification having addressed coverage in the early part of their rollouts.
Sprint and T-Mobile are fast on their heels and soon will finish their initial coverage buildout.
If history and Verizon and AT&amp;T's experience holds we expect that Sprint and T-Mobile will soon be focusing on network densification and we are already seeing signs of those conversations happening -- that would be in the 2015 time frame.
Given the revolutionary nature of 4G we have reasons to believe that the 4G LTE deployment cycle will be even longer than the 3G cycle.
And in order to meet Cisco's projected 8x increase in mobile data demand we believe carriers will continue to invest over a multiyear period.
This multiyear deployment cycle gives us confidence in the long runway of sustained organic revenue growth.
Our team has a tremendous track record of execution giving me a lot of confidence it will be able to leverage this unprecedented level of activity.
With nearly 40 000 towers and 12 000 small cells in the U.S.
as I previously mentioned I believe we are well poised to continue to benefit greatly from these macro trends as we have in the past.
In the near term our team is working diligently to integrate the AT&amp;T towers into our portfolio so that we're able to deliver a Crown quality customer service experience across these assets as soon as possible.
We have made significant strides to that end in the first several months since closing.
And while it's early our operating results are off to a good start across these new assets.
So in wrapping up and moving towards questions our strategy remains unchanged.
We are focused on adding site rental revenue across our portfolio of assets and investing our capital to maximize our long-term total shareholder return which we measure as growth in AFFO per share plus the increasing dividend we anticipate in the years to come.
With that operator can you please turn the call over for questions? [Operator Instructions] And your first question today will come from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> First thanks for providing the supplemental information and making what was probably not an easy decision but going to a consistent comparable AFFO definition.
We appreciate that.
A couple of questions.
First on the organic growth side can you -- obviously services business had another good quarter.
It was big in 4Q continued to be big in 1Q.
Help us understand what your thoughts are now as far as how much that's going to contribute in '14? And then also in the organic side in the supplemental exhibits you gave there's some nice color on 1Q Page 13 talking about 8.5% growth and 1.4% churn for cash organic net growth.
But then for the year that organic growth goes up to 8.8% but churn jumps to 2.7%.
Help us understand is that the iDEN stuff? Or what's going on there? And what should we think as we look into '15 '16 what that looks like? Sure.
I think the -- as you look at the growth of the full year if you're looking at the outlook there's a couple of things that are happening.
Obviously we've folded in the AT&amp;T results; that is entirely in the first quarter and that will continue for the balance of the year.
On the cost side we're staffing up in the first quarter both in terms of direct expenses that would hit the gross margin site rental gross margin line and also some of G&amp;A and then the buildout of the facilities which would impact AFFO.
And that's -- most of that is starting to come in during Q2.
There may be a little bit of it that doesn't get all the way in Q2 and would impact Q3 but I think most of that will be in the Q2.
So I think that reconciles how to think about the addition of the AT&amp;T asset.
On the second part of the question we're expecting organic growth to accelerate over the back half of the year.
As I think Ben and I both mentioned in our comments the leasing that we're assuming in Qs 2 3 and 4 on average is about 15% higher than what we saw in Q1.
And that's coming from all of the items that Ben mentioned around the big 4 operators.
Most of that is new tenant installation on sites rather than amendments as we've seen over the last several years.
So it's site densification and them adding additional sites.
And we see that in the pipeline today given that we're sitting here in late April.
We can see most of that already in the pipeline.
And then on the churn side most of that is iDEN.
So that started to come into the revenue side in the first quarter although most of it really we only saw 1 month worth of churn in the first quarter from iDEN and then we'll see it for the balance of the year.
As we go into the calendar year next year I think we previously mentioned we thought during calendar year '14 we would see about 1% impact to revenues from churn from iDEN a little over 1%.
And then the balance of it we would expect to see in '15.
And then any licenses that are canceled in the back half of '15 obviously will have a little bit of fall-over into '16.
So probably 1/3 this year 2/3 next year as you're trying to time out when we'll see the impact from iDEN.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Makes sense.
And then on external growth it looks like you had $62 million worth of acquisitions in the quarter.
Was that for buying building towers? And then Ben you've hit pretty hard about how the U.S.
is the best market you feel for wireless.
What are your thoughts internationally? Is there anything that would be interesting to you in how you frame that? Sure you want to take the first part? Yes.
On the CapEx side those were all either CapEx we're adding on existing sites and then the construction of new sites the vast majority of which would be in small cells.
We didn't have any meaningful tower acquisitions in the first quarter.
Ric we -- obviously we're very proud of our track record and our business model around the economics of shareable infrastructure and that clearly translates really to many markets around the world as wireless is a growing business worldwide today and we see that in our international business in Australia today.
So we completely support the notion of shared infrastructure in other countries and we continue to look.
The challenge we've had thus far and the reason we haven't pulled the trigger on anything of any size has been the initial upfront price relative to the cost of capital in those other markets.
We've just not been able to get to a sort of risk-adjusted total return expectation on lease-up which you have to have when you impose the currency risk and inflation and other things that happen in some of those markets.
It comes at a premium.
And in our opinion we haven't been able to meet the price or expectations of sellers and therefore haven't pulled the trigger.
So it's merely a function of price.
It has really not a lot to do with -- at a price the shared model certainly works sense -- makes sense and works anywhere in the world.
We are extremely bullish as we talked about on what we see happening in the U.S.
market.
We would note that we're in pretty good company with Verizon's decision to acquire their Vodafone interest.
So we've got a lot on our plate here.
The small cell business is going well and as networks densify and add new cell sites to accommodate the capacity we've got a lot to do here.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And what is small cell -- I think you said it's grown significantly.
But what is it out of the total leasing revenue? It's a little over 5% almost 6%.
And as I mentioned in my comments it's up about 20% year-over-year Ric.
Your next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> So Jay maybe I think at the last couple of weeks of last year's fourth quarter we had about an $18 million contribution from the AT&amp;T portfolio.
And I think that you ended up guiding to about $400 million -- embedded in the guidance $400 million contribution for 2014.
Obviously the annualized run rate of last year's AT&amp;T portfolio growth would have been probably closer to $33 million higher than that.
So can you talk a little bit about realized performance in the AT&amp;T portfolio and how changes in expectations for the contribution of that portfolio to 2014 have influenced your guidance setting? And the last question is just on the 20% growth year-over-year in the small cell business could give us an update on how big that business is now today as a percentage of the total? Sure.
On the first question I would say so far the AT&amp;T assets are performing very well in terms of the run rate of both revenues and gross margin that we acquired relative to what we expected in the acquisition.
On a cash basis it's slightly ahead of what we had underwritten and expected to have coming out of the gate.
There's obviously whenever you -- if you're looking at the GAAP revenue numbers there's the impacts of straight-line both in terms of site rental revenues and site rental direct expenses related to ground leases.
So there's some movement there but on a cash basis it's slightly ahead.
And there is some benefit in our uplift of about $11 million in site rental revenue.
A portion of that would be related to higher run rate -- initial run rates out of the AT&amp;T portfolio as well as the activity that I spoke about earlier of about 15% higher in the second half of the year and second quarter -- and second third and fourth quarter of the year compared to the first quarter.
So it's a combination of those 2 things that's driving the increase in revenue.
On the 20% growth again it's about 6% of consolidated revenues today and it's up about 20% year-over-year.
Ben I don't know if you want to speak to any details on what we're seeing.
Well I would just say yes we're just -- we're seeing a very significant uptake in small cell architecture among -- amongst several of the carriers as they're using it as a way to add capacity in dense markets.
When we talk about small cell as you know we're in the indoor business and the outdoor business.
Certainly we're doing a number of venues and those are co-locatable networks and I'm very pleased with that.
We're also having great success and a growing building of a pipeline in the outdoor small cell architecture.
We're again serving higher density locations where macro sites are just unable to handle the traffic.
And so this is an underlay type of architecture across where they would certainly already be coverage.
And we're seeing a very significant uptake this year in that architecture and one that I think will ultimately be adopted in a robust way by all 4 of the major wireless carriers over time.
Research Division</strong> And Jay if I can just a quick follow-up.
The 20% growth in 6% of the business so that's obviously giving you a percentage point of incremental revenue tailwind.
Is that factored into the 8% organic same-store sales revenue growth before disconnects in the slide deck? It is both on the historical data as well as the look forward.
And the 9% forward.
Yes.
Your next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
LLC Research Division</strong> Yes I was interested in the nature of the staff increases that you've referenced maybe a little bit more color on both direct expenses and the G&amp;A-type staffing that you're doing.
Secondly on the DAS I -- you gave the year-on-year growth rates and the scale of the business.
Can you talk about whether your incremental investments in DAS is that going towards more nodes or more fiber mileage or can you give us a little bit of color about what's happening on the infrastructure side? And then my last question is on M2M Spectrum Networks in the press release that came out earlier in the month and kind of what your expectations are from that partnership and what they're doing.
Okay.
On the first question around the direct expenses in G&amp;A maybe the easiest way to do it Jon is to start from Q1 and then walk you to Q2.
And then after Q2 as I mentioned I think it will mostly be in the run rate.
Moving from Q1 to Q2 there's the warmer weather impacts that we always see as well as having more towers.
That steps up direct site rental expenses by approximately $3 million from Q1 to Q2.
The second item that's meaningful in site rental operating expenses would be around staffing and that number moves up about $2 million roughly from Q1 to Q2.
And that's a result -- as a result of us hiring folks throughout the first quarter to staff properly for the AT&amp;T transaction.
And then by the time we get to the second quarter it's fully in the run rate.
So I wouldn't expect meaningful steps in those expenses in Q3 and Q4.
If you go to the cash G&amp;A line and this would exclude stock-based comp because as you look at our G&amp;A line the G&amp;A line I think will look almost completely flat year-over-year.
So the impact to EBITDA and you can look at what is happening in -- around cash G&amp;A.
And there there's probably another $2 million to $3 million step-up that we're seeing inside the quarter from Q1 to Q2 for a similar reason as to what I was speaking about in direct expenses where we staffed up during the first quarter and then we have the full run rate in the second quarter.
And then from there I would expect we'll see both in terms of direct site rental expenses and G&amp;A those numbers to return to something in the neighborhood of about 3% growth on an annual basis from normal cost escalations.
Secondly Jon you asked about the incremental investment and activity we're seeing on the small cell side.
Primarily what we're doing is we're benefiting from the significant fiber plant that we acquired in the NextG acquisition back in 2012.
From that which we have significant fiber plant in many major cities we're co-locating across that existing fiber plant as well as adding additional laterals to that extending the capacity of that plant into other locations.
And so it gets sort of very blurry.
It's not quite as clear-cut as the tower model where you're adding a tenant on an existing tower.
Effectively you're adding an additional tenant or node on existing fiber and it may come with modifications or extensions to that fiber that we're doing on behalf of that tenant with an expectation for further tenancy over time.
So the term co-location is still alive and well in that business and working very well.
It often comes with additional fiber that we're building again shareable among many.
And then the last point.
I think you were asking Ric about the mobile-to-mobile M2M solutions press release that went out earlier in the month.
That was a transaction or partnership that we've done with somebody to continue to build out small cells and I think it's relatively small and won't be that impactful to site rental revenues or gross margins adjusted EBITDA in the near term.
I think there are as Ben was speaking to in his commentary there are a number of connected devices.
And we're going to see the impact of those or believe we'll see the impact of those both on our traditional towers as well as in the small cell space for a long period of time.
And so this was an early one that they wanted to put out their desire to engage us in a meaningful way from their perspective to get their solution rolled out.
I think Jay you mentioned in your comments that our -- the vast majority about 90% of our activity right now is from the Big 4 carriers.
And that's skewed a little high lately.
For years the -- what I would call the "other category" has been the equivalent of sort of one of the other Big 4.
So there's sort of a Big 5 out there.
And then of late that has been light in that there's -- most of the activity has been around the Big 4 carriers.
This M2M-type announcement highlights that there are always other people with access to spectrum as I mentioned longer-term thoughts around DISH LightSquared and FirstNet that certainly stand to contribute to our growth over time but not in the current outlook.
LLC Research Division</strong> So if I could follow up then the nature of the AT&amp;T integration CapEx what does that consist of? And then on the fiber footprint that you mentioned I did ask this several quarters ago are there opportunities to monetize that for non-mobile carriers or even enterprises given the metro nature of the fiber assets that you have? Sure.
I'll take the first one.
You can do the second one Ben.
On the AT&amp;T CapEx we would have the normal repair and maintenance CapEx that we would expect to have.
That will be on a recurring basis.
And we'll start that during calendar year 2014 and we expect that to continue annually.
Jon if you're trying to pencil that out for the model that generally works out to about $700 of CapEx per tower per annum.
And so we've adjusted our outlook for sustaining capital expenditures to include that roughly $700 per asset.
In addition to that in the calendar year 2014 we're building out some additional office facilities to house the additional employees that I mentioned in the -- in my answer to your first question and so there is some CapEx this year.
It's going to be in the neighborhood in total of about $17 million.
Obviously I don't expect that to recur in future years.
So that will be a cost we incur in calendar year 2014.
And then beyond that we would just have our normal repair and maintenance CapEx on a per asset basis.
It's a little spike this year.
And then on the monetization of the existing fiber plant obviously we're working hard every day to add small cell nodes to that fiber.
But to your point we have a small level of fiber-to-the-cell business already monetizing some of that fiber.
And we have some other opportunities that I wouldn't call material yet but are interesting.
And I think there's a number of ways over time we can monetize the fiber those that we already own and what we may construct over time.
But as yet Jon it's probably not material enough to really highlight.
Your next question will come from Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
Yes.
How much capacity do T-Mo and AT&amp;T have under their MLAs? And as these companies start to build out 700 megahertz Leap and then AWS3 could you see amendment revenue from these carriers later this year and especially 2015 or is this restricted by the MLAs? Yes.
Kevin we -- as we've talked about we're down to about 10% of our activity now as being covered by the so-called MLA contracts that were prepaid if you will presold.
And we expect that to continue to fall.
So really any future activities the most significant portion of that would be new revenue opportunities going forward.
Without getting real specific by carrier by market we expect that 10% level to sort of hold and trail off over time.
Is it fair to think of the 700 at T-Mo and the Leap spectrum and AWS at Verizon is that more of a '15 event? Yes I would characterize it as more of a '15 event exactly given that we're already 1/3 of the way through the year.
So there's not a -- the implied organic growth acceleration does not include a lot from these new spectrum bands? That's right.
Exactly.
Your next question on line will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> I would love to touch on the overall spending environment debate here.
You folks are once again raising your outlook for the year.
Thus far we've seen positive commentary from the carriers that have reported around their spending initiatives particularly noting that densification is fairly important.
I would welcome any additional color on how you think about the densification opportunity particularly the size of the opportunity relative to the initial coverage upgrades to LTE.
In other words when we think about all the equipment needed at the site to optimize LTE traffic be it fiber cabling remote radio heads multiband antennas or whatever the carriers are working with is this densification opportunity for 4G as large an opportunity as sort of initial network deployments? Yes.
Thanks Amir.
This is Ben.
I'll take a crack at that one.
Densification and the anticipation of adding additional cell sites after the initial coverage build is our entire business thesis.
We've spent $9 billion on buying 17 000 towers and 10 000 DAS nodes in the last few years just based on that exact view.
And that is now happening and playing out in spades.
As we talked about in our prepared remarks where in the case of Verizon and AT&amp;T they're actively moving into that cell site densification activity adding additional locations where they weren't previously present going on new towers as their LTE networks load up and they need to add capacity.
That's also what we're seeing on the small cell side.
We fully expect if history is any guide that you'll see the same occur out of Sprint and T-Mobile over time as they complete their initial coverage build on LTE.
And we're already having initial conversations with them around their build plans for 2015 in anticipation of that happening.
So our thesis which again played out quite well back from 1999 to today is that you have initial coverage build and then you have infill and that's exactly what we're seeing happening in the market today and what we expect will happen for many years to come as we lease up these new sites we've acquired with roughly 1.7 tenants per tower.
We have a lot of capacity and a lot of locations that can quickly and efficiently aid these carriers in adding capacity into their networks.
So that's what we're all about.
Research Division</strong> And if I may just a follow-up you folks are fairly uniquely positioned in sort of your focus on the DAS and some of the small cell technologies.
If I think about where we are today in transitioning towards more densification initiatives have you seen any switch in priorities on -- in terms of spending? In other words are carriers that you work with both on the DAS side and on the macro side reallocating capital? Or is it just more spend to everything? Well it really is carrier-specific again depending upon where they are in their deployment cycle with 4G.
But I would say that we have seen absolutely no evidence of switching as you used that term.
What we've seen is sort of more of everything.
And so of those that are now in the densification mode there's a very heightened sense of urgency to add capacity to deal with all of the requirements and demands that we as consumers are putting on these networks as we mentioned with mobile video connected machine-to-machine voice over LTE which is still coming.
So there is a lot of future demand that the carriers honestly are trying to build in anticipation of and keep up with our current needs.
But I haven't seen any evidence of switching per se.
It's just now we have an architecture that adds capacity very efficiently in high dense areas and reuses that frequency on a -- with very small cells and reuses that frequency frequently.
That's something that we're continuing to benefit from and working very hard to optimize.
We've got a lot of people working on building out the -- in the co-location on the fiber that we mentioned on the small cell side and a very robust pipeline there.
Your next question on the line will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> I guess first if I look at the acceleration going forward of activity in the business it seems like there could be upside to your services business as well.
Is that acceleration something that you can capitalize on in services? Well Phil we've got a pretty good track record of growing the services business as you all know.
We're also kind of reticent to guide up on services.
But I would say that with the addition of 10 000 towers this year we would naturally expect with the activity that we ought to be able to replicate last year.
As you sort of back into the guidance you can sort of figure out that the service activity for this year now is roughly the same as last year that's sort of what's implicit in the guidance.
Can we do better than that? We'll see as we go through the year.
We are extremely pleased with the take rates and the confidence that our carrier customers are placing in us in helping them meet these needs both on augmenting and amending cell sites as well as brand-new installations.
So we'll see but it's continuing to go in a very big way.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then second I guess on the small cell side.
Is it easier to build small cell infrastructure where Crown has towers or carriers consider reuse backhaul and you have some zoning and staff? Or does something else sort of drive the ability to build? Do you need local teams or do those teams move around? So we have a lot of local presence.
I mean we operate a national business since we have people in local markets.
And while I would say there has been some overlap and some benefit and I would suggest to you in the future there will be more benefit and more overlap where we have towers where you can even use some compounds at towers to build laterals off of tower sites into the small cell architecture that has not been a real material part of the activity so far.
I think it will over time.
What the most I guess determining factor is for us and what's the most efficient obviously is where we already have fiber.
Where we already have some of these 6 200 miles of fiber that we own in these major cities that becomes a very compelling proposition for carriers looking to add an architecture in those markets.
And then obviously we have to build more as we're serving additional locations with laterals off of that spectrum -- I mean off of that fiber.
But obviously the most important part of that is having that embedded fiber base already there and that's yielding this pipeline we've spoken about.
Probably the other synergy Phil I might just mention for you is really on the sales side and sales cycle this activity.
We've talked about for years that when we do our customer surveys that we have the highest rate of customer service in the industry.
And so as we broadened our service opportunity for small cells and demonstrated to the carriers in the early days that we're able to do these successfully to build them on time to make them work we've got a great track record of that.
And that helps us as the carriers are looking to expand their portfolio.
And I think our track record and our sales effort there has been really helpful and that obviously has benefited greatly from the synergies of how well we've done over a long period of time on the tower side and on the services side.
They trust us and they know we'll do what we say we're going to do.
So I think that has benefited us greatly since we did the large acquisition 2 years ago.
The next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> So Ben you talked about FirstNet a couple of times.
It seems like the funding is coming into view here with the H Block and the AWS auctions.
Have you been able to get more substantive conversations in terms of trying to feel like is that something that could start contributing in '15 or is it still sort of '16 '17? And then again thanks for the supplemental disclosure.
If I'm reading it right you're about 71% of the top 100 markets.
How does the growth trajectory look in your top 100 markets versus the other markets? Are we still seeing a superior growth trajectory there or is it more even now? No I would suggest the top 100 markets are probably even accelerating from what you see as the historical -- we provided in the supplement now the historical run rates of revenue both top 100 and otherwise on those towers.
So you can see the spread there.
I would suggest it's accelerating as the density of those markets is where all this capacity is required on top of the tower business and I would overlay the small cell business and say obviously that's happening primarily in the top 100 markets although not completely primarily in the top 100 markets.
So that's -- I think that's probably going to accelerate over time.
The FirstNet activity Simon I hate to put a timeline on it.
You can expect given our position in the market that we are very close to FirstNet and what's going on there.
And they've got the keys to our system and are profiling our sites and portfolios in various markets and know how we could assist them and we're in constant dialogue.
But I would really not want to sort of put a timeline on exactly when we would think that would turn into revenue.
As you know there's a lot of moving pieces there state by state and so let's hold that one out for now.
And obviously it's a nice opportunity that we think will yield something in the future but not in the current outlook.
Your next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
LLC Research Division</strong> Great.
I wanted to go back to the organic growth and I guess more specifically the churn.
So you reported in the supplemental it was 1.4% in the quarter and the guide was 2.7% for the year.
So obviously an expectation for a meaningful increase as we go through the year.
When we think about it collectively and we think of just total site rental revenue do you expect the fourth quarter to be the low point for total site rental revenue based on that rising churn or is it more going to happen in the second or third quarter and then we start to grow from there? I'm just trying to get a sense of what's the low point as it relates to site rental revenue as a result of the churn so we can get a better understanding what the jumpoff point might be as we go into 2015.
And then just kind of going through your supplementals related to small cell if I take the 6% of revenue that small cell represents as site rental revenue and just divide that by the node I get to about $1 300 which you are generating per small cell -- or excuse me per node right now.
Is that -- could you give us an idea of how many customers are averaging on a per node so we can get a better sense of what you're generating on a per customer basis? And just curious are you getting escalators for that call it $1 300 per month? And just getting a sense is that a good number to look at or does it vary widely so don't read too much into it? I'm just trying to get a bit of a sense of how we should start thinking about modeling out small cell.
Sure Colby.
On your first question the churn numbers looks -- I think it's important to draw a delineation between as you're thinking about the impact to site rental revenues in the full year 2014 versus full year 2015 as you asked that question.
There is as I mentioned in my comments an acceleration by virtue of the fact that the iDEN churn didn't start occurring until March of this year.
So as you go through the balance of the year you in essence start to have full quarter impacts from the prior quarter nonrenewals.
So really in the second third and fourth quarter we're expecting a similar level of nonrenewals as we go through each of those quarters.
The back half of the year the cumulative impact of that is higher and it will continue to grow all the way through calendar year 2015 which would have the highest cumulative amount of impact.
But on a steady state as you're thinking about sequential change quarter-to-quarter the biggest news there is really Q1 to Q2 as we go from 1 month of impact to a full quarter impact.
And then after that you kind of have full quarter impacts.
So the sequential change is most impacted then from Q1 to Q2.
As we look at the revenue outlook for the balance of the year given that we're expecting an increase in leasing of 10% at the organic growth line that number would accelerate over the course of the year.
So your sequential steps in net revenue quarter-to-quarter are going to be degraded by the time you get to the fourth quarter.
So hopefully that sort of helps you think through your model.
On the second question I think as you get into the pricing on a tenant basis with small cells it's a little different than traditional towers because the systems are priced based on what needs to occur at the local level in order to accomplish that buildout.
So these are priced much more on a return basis.
I would say generally speaking you kind of laid out the numbers you're in the general ballpark of what small cells revenue impact is on a per site basis.
Maybe a little high but there are certain systems that are going to be even higher than the number that you mentioned and other systems that are lower.
So we're pricing these on a return basis.
And as we've said historically we think the returns on small cells are similar to that of towers if you price them on a ticket system that has 3 tenants on them or 4 tenants on them.
And the returns on those would look very similar to a tower that would have 3 to 4 tenants.
The business is performing very well and the lease-up that we're seeing on the small cells that we've built thus far they're actually leasing faster than what we've historically seen from towers.
So the returns or the margins or how we want to think about yields on those assets they're achieving yields higher than -- over a shorter period of time from what we've traditionally seen in towers which is probably a better way to think about it rather than trying to price that out on a per node basis because we're pricing these based on the invested capital required in order to accomplish them.
Your next question will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
Research Division</strong> Just 2 clarifications.
Last year I think you talked about 8% of organic growth.
Was that net of churn? And then just on Colby's question did the small cells have escalators embedded in them? And then Ben I get asked the question a lot so I figured I'd ask you.
Any kind of current thoughts on potential technological cannibalization? I know the cable companies sound like they're going to be deploying Wi-Fi hotspots fairly aggressively.
I believe there was an article yesterday that -- of a pCell technology that DISH might be trialing.
I guess is that kind of maybe a risk or benefit to you guys? On the first question the 8% number we were talking about last year that was on a gross basis before nonrenewals.
So we're now -- we've moved that number from 8% to 9%.
That 1% move is all related to the new leasing activity.
Escalators are remaining the same as we've previously expected.
We do have escalators on the DAS.
Thank you for reasking the question.
I'm sorry I missed that in Colby's question.
There are embedded escalators in the DAS contracts.
The terms of those leases are very similar to towers as we noted in the supplement.
There's about 8 years remaining on the average term on those leases and so they look very similar to tower leases both in terms of term and escalation provisions.
Tim on the technology question as I think about technology what we've seen that's been most impactful so far aside from just spectral efficiencies we've gained in the equipment by putting our RUs [ph] up the tower and things like that it has been the emergence of Wi-Fi hotspots.
And I don't want to speak for my carrier customer friends but I suspect in certain places they're somewhat relieved that you're getting wireless -- somewhat a relief there through Wi-Fi hotspots.
And I believe by some estimates it's already offloading as much as 50% of the traffic when we're all using Wi-Fi when we can.
It's our expectation that as I've said in my prepared remarks net of that kind of offloading node in the mobile environment there's licensed spectrum and handoff from one cell to the other is sort of the dominant architecture.
We're going to continue to see very significant growth on the licensed spectrum side if for no other reason just because of the capacity requirements that's needed with as we mentioned with 350 megahertz out there and more to come.
That's a whole lot more than you could traditionally do a Wi-Fi node.
And then with respect to the pCell Artemis article the other day from time to time there are valuable new technologies that come up.
They don't -- they change the laws of physics and they do require light installations and some level of backhaul connectivity into whether it's a vertical height or it's an installation that looks a lot like a small cell.
And over time to the extent that's viable and I think it's very early days but to the extent that's viable I would think that would certainly be something we could benefit from over time.
Your last question will come from Batya Levi with UBS.
Research Division</strong> Just a couple of quick follow-ups.
Last quarter you had mentioned that you expected to be at the high end of 25% to 30% revenue increase for new leases.
Now you're looking for a 15% sequential increase off of 1Q.
So given the prior comments how should we think about the overall annual growth? And the new installment and amendment mix that you gave 85% 15% how does that compare to last year? And can you also provide some color on average rental revenue for amendments? Yes.
On the first question if you were to take the 25% to 30% that we said before and then factor in the 15% from Q2 to Q3 Q4 probably closer to about 35% maybe a little bit more than that year-over-year growth in terms of new activity and amendment activity.
Combine that and think about that in terms of organic revenue growth on the sites.
On the amendment activity 85% of the total revenue activity leasing activity that we're seeing is new licenses is 15%.
That probably compares last year to somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% new and 40% amendments.
In the year prior to that it was almost a complete inverse of '14 where we were seeing between 10% and 20% new licenses and about 80% almost of the activity was coming from amendments.
Most of that speaks to the commentary that Ben gave around the carriers' move from the coverage buildout for 4G to looking at site densification.
In terms of what we're seeing from both amendments and new leasing pricing it's up from past years and on a like-for-like basis if you look at the equipment being added it's -- the pricing has gone up probably 3% to 4% on an annual basis.
When you start to try to compare what's the average amendment or the average lease you really have to do that analysis on a carrier by carrier basis and look at what equipment are they actually putting up.
Otherwise the numbers are not necessarily comparable and we're not prepared to share pricing by carrier.
So I think I'll stop there on the explanation.
I was about to stop you.
I -- Listen I appreciate everybody by going along with us this morning.
I know it was a very busy morning for reporting.
I want to commend the team for putting out the supplemental package.
You can appreciate this was a lot of work to determine what we thought was most relevant to you the investor.
There's a lot of good information in here that I would encourage you to spend a little time with.
I think most importantly that I think is relevant is it will help all of us more easily toggle between the GAAP reported revenue numbers and the adjusted numbers adjusted for straight-line and acquisitions.
That's a challenging concept.
It sounds easy.
It's not.
I appreciate that and we -- it's challenging for us and we do it every day.
So hopefully some of this disclosure for example on Page 8 for one and others that really kind of gets this into very granular terms is helpful for your own modeling and to really understand what's going on in the business.
Again thanks to the team for doing that and thank you again for listening and staying along with us this morning.
We look forward to reporting to you on another very successful quarter next quarter.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference call for today.
We thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect your lines.

These reconciling -- such non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.
With that I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Thanks Son and good morning everyone.
We had another great quarter in Q2 2014 exceeding the high end of our previously issued outlook for site rental revenue adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
The excellent results achieved during the second quarter allow us to increase our outlook for full year 2014.
During the quarter we also made significant progress integrating the AT&amp;T towers and we expect to substantially complete integration by the fall of this year.
Turning to Slide 3.
In the second quarter site rental revenue grew 21% year-over-year from $617 million to $746 million.
Organic Site Rental Revenue before nonrenewals increased by $50 million an increase of approximately 9% compared to the same period in 2013.
The approximately 9% Organic Site Rental Revenue growth is comprised of approximately 4% growth from cash escalations in our customer lease contracts and approximately 5% growth from new leasing activity.
As a part of the new leasing activity we are continuing to see very strong demand for our small cell networks.
At the end of the second quarter we had nearly 13 000 small cell nodes on air or under construction and over 6 000 miles of fiber.
In addition we have executed contracts for over 3 500 new small cell nodes to build and we are at various stages of preconstruction work including design and permitting.
Site rental revenue from our cell -- small cell networks is up approximately 26% year-over-year and small cells generated 6% of consolidated site rental revenues.
For the quarter nonrenewal of tenant leases reaching their contractual term end date inclusive of Sprint's iDEN decommissioning was in line with our expectations of approximately 2% of site rental revenue.
As shown on Slide 4 site rental gross margin increased $72 million to $509 million up 16% from the second quarter of 2013.
In Q2 our site rental operating expenses of $237 million came in higher than our previously provided Q2 outlook range by $2 million.
Excluding a noncash purchase accounting adjustment related to our acquisition of AT&amp;T towers our site rental operating expenses would have been within our guidance range.
This noncash item doesn't impact adjusted EBITDA or AFFO.
For the full year 2014 this noncash item results in an increase to site rental operating expenses of approximately $3 million and is reflected in our revised outlook.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 increased 19% from the same quarter in 2013.
This growth is attributable to the increase in site rental gross margin inclusive of the AT&amp;T towers and the strong performance from network services and offset to a small degree by increased G&amp;A.
Compared to the same quarter last year site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin percentages were negatively impacted by the AT&amp;T tower transaction which have an average tenancy of 1.7 tenants and therefore lower margins when compared to our legacy assets with approximately 3 tenants per tower.
In addition site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA were impacted by the investment we have made in our people processes and assets over the last several quarters which shows up in our increased run rate of site rental and network services operating expenses as well as G&amp;A.
This increase in cost is being made to accommodate the high level of leasing activity we are experiencing on both towers and small cells.
I would also note that the increase in contribution from network services alone far exceeds the totality of the increase in run rate costs.
The increase in costs to manage an expanded portfolio is consistent with our past practice and our strategy to provide the highest level of customer service in the industry.
To provide some context in 2007 when we closed the Global Signal acquisition of approximately 11 000 towers site rental gross margin postacquisition was 64% compared to 70% prior to the acquisition.
In a period of 2 years margins returned to 70% reaching 75% within 4 years.
The investment we made in additional staffing during that time frame positioned us to meaningfully grow our business as site rental revenues increased from $1.3 billion in 2007 to $1.9 billion over the same 4-year period.
In the absence of additional acquisitions we expect to see our site rental gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin percentages expand as carriers add equipment to our sites reflecting the high operating leverage of our business and increasing the yield on our assets.
AFFO for the second quarter was $351 million compared to $273 million for the same period a year ago an increase of 28%.
On a per-share basis AFFO was up 13% increasing from $0.93 per share to $1.05 per share.
Moving on to investments and financing activities as shown on Slide 5.
During the quarter we closed on an 8-year $850 million senior notes offering with a coupon of 4.875%.
Proceeds from the offering were used to refinance $800 million of existing debt that had a weighted average coupon of approximately 6%.
Today our weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.2% with a weighted average maturity of 6 years.
Our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.3x and adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense is 4.3x.
We expect to continue to delever through growth and adjusted EBITDA with the goal of reducing debt to adjusted EBITDA below 5x which we believe should position us for an investment grade credit rating.
During the second quarter we invested $167 million in capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $25 million on our land lease purchase program.
During the quarter we extended 389 land leases on our sites by an average of approximately 26 years.
This extension activity impacted consolidated recurring cash ground lease expense by approximately 10 basis points.
Additionally we purchased land beneath 125 of our towers during the quarter.
Today approximately 1/3 of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own and approximately 70% on land we own or lease for more than 20 years.
Where we have ground leases the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 29 years.
Since we began this important effort we have completed over 16 000 individual land transactions.
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we look to control our largest operating expense.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we invested $129 million on revenue-generating capital expenditures consisting of $96 million on existing sites and $33 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell construction activity.
We also spent approximately $13 million on sustaining CapEx which was below our second quarter 2014 outlook.
However we've not adjusted our full year outlook for sustaining capital expenditures as we expect to perform the same sustaining CapEx activities within 2014 completing this expected work during the second half of the year.
Further during the quarter we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.35 per share or $117 million in aggregate.
On Slide 6 I'd like to spend a minute to discuss the sequential impact to the third quarter of 2014 as it relates to adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
Our Q3 2014 outlook for adjusted EBITDA assumes that network services margin contribution to be similar to Q2 2014 which is meaningfully higher than our previous outlook for second half of 2014.
And consistent with my prior comments regarding our investment in people processes and assets we expect to incur higher G&amp;A expenses in Q3 2014 as compared to Q2 2014.
In addition to the flow-through impact from adjusted EBITDA our Q3 2014 outlook for AFFO also reflects higher anticipated sustaining capital expenditures as compared to Q2 related to the buildout of additional office space and for the timing reason I previously mentioned.
Turning to 2014 outlook on Slide 7.
Based on our second quarter results and taking into account the change in our exchange rate assumption for Australia we have increased full year 2014 outlook for site rental revenues adjusted EBITDA and AFFO by $7 million $34 million and $30 million respectively at the midpoint.
As shown on Slide 8 the midpoint of our 2014 outlook for site rental revenues implies growth of 20% on an as-reported basis or approximately $491 million compared to full year 2013.
On an organic basis before nonrenewals our 2014 outlook implies revenue growth of approximately 9% year-over-year at the midpoint.
This 9% is comprised of approximately 5% from new leasing activity and approximately 4% from escalations on existing customer lease contracts.
Further based on Sprint's stated intention to decommission their iDEN network and our contractual terms with Sprint we expect approximately 3% of our run rate site rental revenues to be impacted by the iDEN network decommissioning.
These iDEN leases have effective term end dates spread throughout 2014 and 2015.
As such we expect our site rental revenues to be impacted by approximately $30 million in 2014 and $60 million to $70 million in 2015.
On an organic basis net of nonrenewals our 2014 outlook implies revenue growth of approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint.
Our increased 2014 outlook for adjusted EBITDA implies 17% growth year-over-year reflecting higher expected contribution from network services as well as our acquisition of the AT&amp;T towers.
Our team continues to do an outstanding job in executing for our customers.
While much of the growth in network services can be attributed to the increase in our asset portfolio over the last several years our team has captured more of the services opportunities related to our towers by working closely with our carrier customers.
With the demand for wireless infrastructure expected to continue we believe that the contribution from network services should be sustainable for some time.
Moving on to AFFO on Slide 9 our increased outlook for full year 2014 reflects the increase in our outlook for adjusted EBITDA offset somewhat by higher sustaining capital expenditures.
At the midpoint AFFO of $1.38 billion for 2014 implies per share growth of 13% over full year 2013.
Based on our 2014 outlook we expect to generate approximately $1.6 billion between AFFO and net prepaid rent.
Approximately 30% of this $1.6 billion is allocated to dividends; another 40% is allocated to planned but not -- but discretionary capital expenditures such as land purchases construction of towers and small cells and other capital expenditures associated with additional leasing activity; the remaining 30% is available to pursue share purchases and acquisitions in addition to increasing the amount we plan to spend on revenue-generating capital expenditures.
As we've discussed previously over the next 5 years we expect to increase our dividend per share by at least 15% annually.
We currently have a net operating loss balance or NOL of approximately $2 billion which we would expect to utilize prior to 2020.
We expect that once the NOLs are exhausted our dividend payout as a percentage of AFFO will increase from the approximately 30% today to something in the area of 70% to 80% which implies a compound annual growth rate of our dividend in excess of 20% over this period of time.
Currently we are utilizing the flexibility afforded by the NOLs to make accretive long-term discretionary investments.
These discretionary investments may include acquisitions; the construction of new sites including small cell networks; land purchases; and the purchase of our own securities.
When considering these investments we evaluate each opportunity based on our goal of maximizing our long-term dividends and AFFO per share.
This strategy is not new.
Over a very long period of time our approach to capital allocation combined with strong execution has driven significant growth in AFFO per share.
So in summary we had a great second quarter and I believe that our capital allocation strategy will enhance our long-term growth of AFFO per share and dividends.
And with that I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
As Jay just discussed the second quarter was another excellent quarter positioning us once again to raise our full year outlook.
As shown on Slide 10 we are continuing our track record of consistent execution over a long period of time.
Through strong execution and disciplined capital allocation we have delivered strong AFFO per share growth growing AFFO per share at a compound annual growth rate of 17% since 2007.
Importantly this growth transcended the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and continues today while we have taken decisive steps to position ourselves as the U.S.
market leader with unmatched scale and capabilities.
Today we have new opportunities in small cells and tower leasing unforeseen just a few years ago.
And we created this future runway of growth without materially altering the risk profile of the company.
For the full year of 2014 our midpoint of our outlook suggests AFFO per share growth of 13% compared to 2013 plus the dividends we initiated this year.
We are committed to extending this track record of growth over the long term and we believe that the growth in AFFO per share and dividends will deliver attractive long-term total shareholder returns.
Quite frankly the degree to which we accomplish this goal over the long term is heavily dependent on our ability to increase tenants on the approximately $9 billion in investments we have made over the last few years with the T-Mobile tower and AT&amp;T tower transactions and the NextG small cell acquisition.
In many ways our approach to capital allocation is a reflection of our corporate strategy; we think long term.
We have invested deeply in the U.S.
as we believe the U.S.
market offers the most compelling risk-adjusted returns.
Simply our goal with capital allocation is to maximize our long-term dividend paying capacity from growth and AFFO per share.
We believe that this growth -- this goal dovetails nicely with our recent commencement of operations as a REIT.
Going one step further in assessing our long-term dividend paying capacity we take into consideration many aspects including the quality of our underlying clash flows our long-term growth potential and the risks associated with our business.
When evaluating potential discretionary investments we seek to maximize AFFO per share relative to comparable investments such as share repurchases.
Since 2003 we've invested $2.9 billion in share purchases buying back over 100 million shares or share equivalents at an average price of approximately $28 per share.
As such we view our investment hurdle rate as the long-term total shareholder return we would expect from purchasing our shares as measured by the growth in dividend and AFFO over that same period of time.
Further when it comes to various alternative investments whether they are domestic or international assets or small cells or macro towers we adjust the comparative returns to take into account any perceived differences in the underlying risk of the investment.
Adjustments are made to account for such things as currency and political risks differences in business fundamentals and available financing sources.
For the T-Mobile and AT&amp;T transactions our investment thesis is that we should be able to replicate the performance of our legacy assets with these newly acquired assets over time.
As shown on Slide 11 we believe the T-Mobile and AT&amp;T tower assets with an average tenancy of 1.6 and 1.7 tenants respectively provide an opportunity to enhance our long-term AFFO per share growth by adding tenants.
Tower assets that we've owned and operated for more than 10 years have approximately 3 tenants per tower today and an excess of $90 000 in revenues per tower and currently yield 15% on total invested capital representing significant shareholder value creation when compared to the initial yield at the time of purchase of approximately 4% to 5% similar to the T-Mobile and AT&amp;T transactions.
With our history of acquiring and operating carrier portfolios we believe that these new assets will perform and achieve yields similar to our legacy assets.
Further as Jay stated we are currently investing in our people processes and assets to position us over the long term to realize the lease-up potential on these new towers which have significant available capacity.
These assets are well located as we've stated before with a significant concentration in the top 100 markets where the majority of carrier spending occurs.
And most importantly our investments were made based on our view that there will be continued and significant wireless network investment over the next decade to support the services that we have all come to depend on.
We believe the case for continuing investment in wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
is very compelling for the wireless carriers.
As shown on Slide 12 the U.S.
market with $189 billion in wireless service revenue supporting $34 billion in capital investments on behalf of the carriers is uniquely attractive due to its relative size and robustness compared to other markets.
Increasingly there is a high correlation between network investment and customer satisfaction leading carriers to continue to upgrade their wireless networks to improve network quality increase capacity and add functionality in order to remain competitive and grow.
This virtuous cycle was reinforced just this week as Verizon indicated on their earnings call their continuing commitment to network investment with wireless CapEx expected to be up significantly year-over-year.
They are not alone in this pursuit as Sprint AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are each aggressively investing in LTE upgrades adding capacity and broadband speed.
And our portfolio of sites and capabilities are fully engaged at this point helping them pursue this endeavor.
Further as can be seen on Slide 12 there is also a high correlation between unit economics and carrier capital investment.
With strong unit economics of $50-plus per subscriber per month or $600 annually U.S.
carriers are able to generate positive incremental returns on their capital investment on a scale that dwarfs other geographies.
The relatively high ARPU is supported by the staggering growth in mobile data consumption by U.S.
subscribers.
In CTIA's latest report during 2013 mobile data consumption was estimated to have more than doubled when compared to 2012.
Moreover consumers are increasingly becoming more reliant on mobile in their everyday lives.
According to CDC's National Center for Health Statistics at the end of last year approximately 41% of U.S.
households relied solely on wireless phones.
CTIA reports that this number jumps to over 55% when including households that have -- that do not rely on wireline services.
The average U.S.
consumer spends more than 50% of his or her Internet time on mobile devices currently.
In fact according to peer research 34% of mobile U.S.
subscribers use their mobile devices as their primary device to access the Internet.
Today it seems as though almost every aspects of our lives have gone mobile: mobile retail mobile banking mobile health and mobile security streaming entertainment cloud computing and connected devices are all driving increased network usage.
With these new applications and an introduction of the adoption of data-intensive mobile devices Cisco projects that mobile data traffic even after accounting for Wi-Fi offloading will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 50% or an eightfold increase over the next 5 years.
To meet the growing demand by consumers and drive incremental returns as the pie gets larger we believe U.S.
carriers will continue to find it attractive to invest in their networks.
And as carriers continue to invest consumers and businesses have quickly absorbed the network capacity added by the carriers leading to a reinforcing cycle of investment by the carriers and increased usage by the end consumer.
This recurring cycle of investment has led to continuous network improvements giving us confidence that we will benefit from a long runway of sustained organic revenue growth.
Before wrapping up I'd like to spend a minute on our small cell activity.
More and more carriers are turning to small cells to address capacity and coverage issues that cannot be solved by macro tower sites alone.
As a result we are seeing activity on the small cells front from all 4 major wireless carriers.
As Jay mentioned year-over-year site rental revenues from small cells is up 26% with a robust pipeline in front of us.
To date our yield on invested capital for small cells is already in excess of 6% including the $1 billion investment we made in the NextG acquisition which was acquired with an initial yield of approximately 4%.
Due to the high operating leverage and significant demand we expect that the lease-up for small cells will continue to drive meaningful increases in yield we believe the runway of opportunities in small cells is very similar to what we saw in towers back in the early 2000s.
As the largest provider of small cells with over 13 000 nodes and over 6 000 miles of fiber feeding them our scale and expertise position us to capitalize on this growing opportunity and we expect to continue to make investments in this area.
To wrap up our investments of the last few years have expanded our portfolio to nearly 40 000 towers and over 13 000 nodes positioning us as the U.S.
market leader in shared wireless infrastructure.
I am very pleased with the progress we've made on the integration of the AT&amp;T towers while handling very high levels of activity in the business on all fronts.
We are keenly focused on delivering for our carrier customers and extending our track record of growth in AFFO per share for many years to come.
With that operator I'd like to turn the call over for questions.
[Operator Instructions] And we will first go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Ben nice overview.
I wonder if you can square some of the headlines we're hearing about spending freezes at the carriers and other issues out of the equipment providers.
You've had strong services businesses.
You've got a good outlook for the second half of the year.
So what are you actually seeing in the field? Are you seeing any signs of this? Because clearly there is a little bit of a disconnect that people are trying to get their heads around.
And on the services I think you talked about it being strong into Q3.
Can you just give us a little bit of a longer-term outlook? Is this something as we go into '15 you see these levels being maintained as well? Sure Simon.
First of all on the capital spending side with the carriers we're seeing a lot of activity.
And I believe that AT&amp;T addressed this on their call any slowdown or deferment in the second half of the year that AT&amp;T may be pursuing is completely immaterial to what we're seeing.
And we have a tremendous amount of activity going on frankly with all 4 wireless carriers.
And application volume if you include new site installations as well as amendments for us sort of year-to-date are up materially from last year.
Now we do have a larger portfolio I would acknowledge but we got a lot going on on that front.
And as evidenced by 9% organic revenue growth in our outlook is -- that's moving and that's a lot of work going on.
So we are thrilled with what we see happening on -- by all 4 carriers as they're working on LTE.
Your second question around services is one we continue to spend a lot of time on as a management team.
Our group out there in the field and many of them are listening continue to amaze and are doing a fantastic job of capturing the opportunities and serving our customers in the field and assisting them on getting on our sites.
And the scope of that work has increased over time.
A lot of it has increased because the size of the portfolio has increased but we are increasingly becoming confident that there is certainly a run rate of opportunity out there in this business.
And we've gone back and looked at it since 2007 2008 and '09 where we've come to add capability and there's always a lot of stuff going on on our sites which is a recurring opportunity for us.
So you saw us raise guidance for the second half of the year such that it's going to look a lot like the first half of the year.
And as we look out into '15 I'm not going to give you guidance yet on '15 but we're pretty confident that that level of activity is going to be there for quite some time.
Next is David Barden with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> I think that the confusion a little bit around the quarter and looking at the third quarter outlook Jay is just trying to square the 9% organic revenue growth with site rental gross margin guidance that suggests we might have another sequential downtick in the business.
So -- and obviously the implied full year guidance says we're going to tick back up in the fourth quarter.
But if you could kind of help us waterfall the moving parts so we can see what's growing in the business and then where the headwinds are in more granular form down to the site rental gross margin level that would be super helpful.
And then I guess the second question I would have is relative to the full year 2014 AFFO of 13% growth outlook.
How much of that year-over-year is coming from the AT&amp;T portfolio acquisition? Sure on your first question.
The movements quarter-to-quarter and the way we move the outlook I think for the balance of the year we're certainly benefiting in terms of the outlook from FX and we raised -- slightly raised our expectation for FX based on actual levels that we saw during the second quarter.
So that's the majority of the reason why we raised site rental revenue.
The flow through of that I made several comments which are really driving that too.
One is that we had a purchased -- a noncash purchase adjustment related to our AT&amp;T acquisition.
That flows through those site rental gross margin numbers.
Once we get down to EBITDA we adjust that noncash item out both at an adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
So that's a part of the consideration.
And then the second part of the consideration which wasn't -- was planned when we did the acquisition is we're staffing up -- my comments around staffing and increase in people those were anticipated both in our outlook as well as in our underwriting model for the AT&amp;T towers.
And I think for the most part we've gotten those costs in or we'll have them in by the third quarter.
So I think you correctly point out the squeeze to the fourth quarter would suggest that there is movement upward in site rental gross margin.
And so once we get all the costs into the run rate which I think we'll have mostly done by the third quarter you'll start to see those upward trends that we're used to.
On the 13% we bought the AT&amp;T assets at basically a 5% yield going in.
And when you consider our combination of use of debt as well as stock the transaction was slightly accretive by a couple of pennies in the calendar year 2014 or on a run-rate basis if you want to think about it that way.
So the contribution at the AFFO per share line would be relatively minimal from the acquisition almost none.
If you look at the nominal numbers in terms of site rental revenue growth and margin EBITDA and the absolute dollars of AFFO obviously it contributed meaningfully.
But at the per-share line there's very little impact from the acquisition and the way we financed it.
And we'll go to Kevin Smithen with Macquarie Capital.
This is Will [ph] for Kevin.
If there are no more large deals in the U.S.
to do you're going to have significant excess free cash flow and borrowing capacity in '15.
Can you discuss a little more how you think about that capital allocation? And are you now open to deals in Brazil or other emerging markets? Yes Will [ph] this is Ben.
I'll take a crack at that.
We've got a lot going on as I talked about it in my comments.
And I don't think it's a big stretch to see that we may find the ability to spend virtually all of our discretionary free cash flow right here at home around our core business.
And in particular as the pipeline around small cells grows we're going to put a lot of money to work at very productive rates for carriers that we know and love.
So that's really where our primary focus is today.
We'll always look at something internationally but my working assumption today is that we'll be priced out of anything out there.
So I'm not assuming that we're going to do anything in Latin America or Brazil specifically to your question.
Just based almost solely on where I've seen assets trade I don't think we're a player at those levels.
So we've got a lot on our plate here going deeper in the U.S.
market.
As Jay mentioned we've got 3 500 sites in terms of nodes on the pipeline to be built and that's growing.
So we've got a lot to do with our capital right here at home.
And I have one follow-up.
Is there any number that you give as kind of the addressable remaining sites that you would potentially purchase in the U.S.? I wouldn't speculate on that.
I mean we sort of look at things as they come up.
And I think one of my sort of threshold comments that I think it's important to repeat -- and we'll always look at acquisitions as we have obviously over time.
But the real value creation for Crown Castle going forward is around organic growth.
And it all goes back to that slide in this deck today where we need to turn 17 000 towers from a 5% yield to a 15% yield over time.
And that's the value driver in this business.
Acquisitions obviously become the platform to do that.
You have to have the assets to do that.
But we have the assets today and we have our work cut out for us.
As so we've got a full plate of value creation opportunities right here.
And we'll go to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
Ben you mentioned the 3 500 nodes that are in the pipeline.
What kind of cost or CapEx should we be thinking about and timeline to kind of bring those online? Ric this is Jay.
There's -- the 3 500 I would assume rough math between $100 000 $120 000 per node to build those out.
And typically the timeline from the time of executing the contracts -- and those 3 500 just to be clear in my comments were all preconstruction phase.
So we're in the design and permitting phase of that 3 500.
That's probably an 18-month to 30-month timeline to get those on air.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And then the 13 000 that you have did you say some of those are under construction still? Some of them are at the final stages of construction correct.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then when you think about capital deployment stock buyback is there.
The stock has underperformed the other 2 public tower guys.
So when you look at your multiple where you're trading at and your growth rate how do you look at deploying small cell versus stock buyback? When does all of a sudden the acquisition of your own stock become more interesting possibly? Ric we always do this analysis on a relative basis.
So where we see the opportunity and the returns in our share purchases are always compared at that point in time against other opportunities that we have.
So in the case of -- specifically to your question is we would evaluate small cell opportunities and our appetite to invest in small cells.
They would be compared up against whatever the then multiple is on our equity and what we think the growth prospects are in our underlying business.
And we're -- we constantly update that analysis.
And the capital spend is discretionary.
So at a point in time where we think the return is higher and -- for project A over project B then we tend to move the capital around aiming towards the investment that we think delivers the highest return on AFFO per share as a proxy for ultimately what our dividend capacity is going to be.
So it's really a relative measure and we adjust it based on where we see the market opportunities.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Small cell obviously is a very important part of your story 6% of your business growing 26% a year.
Is there a time where that becomes a segment reported item also as far as revenue gross margins contribution et cetera? There may be a day for that.
I think as we operate the business today it falls underneath our site rental leasing business.
It all falls under our Chief Operating Officer and we operate the business very similar.
It has very similar characteristics to the tower site in terms of the margin the incremental margins that we see as we add additional tenants.
So there may be a day for that.
I won't preclude it from ever happening but I think at the moment it looks very similar to what towers does.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And one more quick one if I could.
A lot of people talking about Sprint Spark the high-frequency buildouts T-Mobile low band.
Is there anything in your guidance yet for those? Have you seen anything in the services business as a leading indicator from Sprint going to that new phase and T-Mobile going into the new phase? Specifically with T-Mobile that's more likely a 2015 event is what it's looking to us.
We're going to get pretty late in the year before we see a lot of that.
So the answer to that would be no until we give you the '15 guidance.
With respect to Sprint we are seeing a tremendous amount of service opportunity from Sprint related to the network vision upgrades and the 2.5 upgrades that you talked about.
And it is also coming through to some degree in site rental revenue growth that's implied without being able to be specific.
It's certainly implied and contributing to this overall 9% growth for the year.
And we'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> So can you talk about services a little bit more? I mean we've talked about services for a long time and usually you give guidance that "Yes this was a great quarter but we're pretty conservative going forward." Now it seems like you have a little bit better visibility.
I mean you talk about Sprint ramping up 2.5.
But is there also -- are you moving to longer contracts that give you more real visibility when giving guidance? Is that how we should think about it? And then second can you help us -- I'm sorry go ahead Jay.
No I'd -- no this is Ben.
Phil I'd say not so much longer contracts but a longer track record of success.
We're frankly -- our teams are teaching me really that this is a business that they are extremely good at and have the capacity to continue to grow.
And so maybe it's on my plate to say I have become more confident in our ability to continue to attract and win this business and execute for carriers.
And we also look at it -- I think it's helpful to parse through how much of the growth is because of the growth in portfolio versus actually growth in the sort of per-site metrics.
And that -- we're up about -- I guess over the last 4 years up about 50% at a per-site level in terms of penetration.
Even though the business is up much larger than that it's more than doubled over the -- that same period but a lot of that is because of the growth in the portfolio.
So maybe it's an education of the CEO that our guys are really good at this and this is going to remain a very key component of our story and what we do with carrier customers to provide that high touch experience and control our assets at the end of the day.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And can you give us an idea of how much of your AFFO is coming from the services side? I think what I would probably suggest that you would do Phil if you were going to try to estimate that is I would take about 40% of the G&amp;A roughly probably between 35% and 45% of the G&amp;A say 40% of the G&amp;A and allocate it to the services business.
So take your gross -- take our gross margin if you want to do historical or forward looking take the gross margin from services and subtract out the G&amp;A and just use that as a contribution.
I mean obviously if we think about leveraging the business we would typically think about leveraging the site rental portion of the business so you may have -- you may want to apply some portion of the debt or maybe not.
There would not be any sustaining capital expenditures of any significant amount associated with that.
So that's probably the best way to go about it.
And next up is Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to follow up on the questions around some of the trajectory of carrier spending here if I may.
Certainly it looks like if we look at the CapEx numbers for the carriers that have reported on a year-over-year basis they look fairly healthy.
But clearly there seems to be a bit of front-end loading with respect to their spending.
Wanted to just touch base there because I understand there's various nuances when it comes to the very specific buckets in terms of where they're spending.
But it seems as though you folks feel very comfortable in raising your outlook for the year in terms of the spending trajectory that you're seeing.
Is that largely coming from densification initiatives that they're spending on? And what gives you that comfort that that carries forward into 2015? Yes Amir this is Ben.
That's a critical question and obviously the driver -- the main driver in our business and confidence in the future.
Without getting into specifically what each carrier is doing because we typically don't do that we let you speak to them as you can see from the Verizon call this week and AT&amp;T that they're spending a whole lot of money: AT&amp;T reconfirming their capital budget for the whole year at around $21 billion; Verizon being up significantly year-over-year through the first 6 months.
And we're seeing a significant amount of activity from both of those carriers as well as Sprint and T-Mobile but they're in different phases.
And so this is where we gain a lot of confidence in the runway of growth that we're going to see.
So as with -- starting with Verizon and AT&amp;T we're seeing them complete their -- really their first sort of initial phase of LTE build and really approaching 300 million covered POPs.
And then immediately following on and we're well into it this year with both of those carriers on adding additional installations brand-new macro-site installations co-los if you will which adds densification to their networks.
And that is happening in a very material way throughout the country.
It is not a stretch then to walk down the lines of Sprint and T-Mobile as they are also working very aggressively on completing their LTE rollout.
And we are -- we would expect then that to follow on with densification on both of those networks over time as the capacity gets consumed on these LTE networks as is currently happening and the need for additional sites becomes more and more acute.
That is beginning to happen.
We're seeing -- we're getting some search rings out of Sprint.
We'd certainly expect to see that out of T-Mobile over time.
And what we're seeing over -- many of us have been in this industry 15 years plus.
We're seeing now a more continuous spend not so much a cycle anymore but just sort of a continuous spend level against ever-increasing ARPUs really driven by data from us as consumers.
And the pie is actually getting bigger.
As we all find more uses for tablets and smartphones the pie is getting bigger.
And as we talked about in the prepared remarks the incremental return on that incremental dollar of investment is alive and well.
And so we sort of see it as sort of a continuous spend as opposed to these sort of fits and starts that we had sort of over the last decade.
Research Division</strong> And then if I may I'll follow up.
You folks are sort of uniquely positioned particularly when it comes to the exposure on the small cell side.
We've had a lot of discussions with the carriers in talking about the value between the macro and the small cell.
But I think the general tone at least right now from what we're hearing is that from a macro site perspective it still provides sort of the best bang for the buck and continued investment on the macro site is necessary to deliver the types of speeds that they're promising over the next couple of years.
Is that something that you folks agree with or -- would love to hear your thoughts on that front.
Absolutely.
I agree with that.
We own 40 000 towers.
It's 94% of our revenue stream and you’ve got to believe we agree with that.
So the macro site is still the most efficient way to add capacity and the most expeditious way to add capacity in a market.
What we're seeing on the small cell business though is an augmentation or a compliment to that where there's areas where the density of the urban footprint is such that a macro site really won't suffice and they're needing to reuse that spectrum in a much smaller cell environment.
And therefore we're seeing an additional architecture emerge as we've talked about for years and it's emerging in a very big way now around distributed antenna systems or small cell euphemistically.
Again we use those sort of interchangeably.
But essentially small antenna's driven by fiber-fed electronics on light poles and street lamps and other things like that to augment where a macro cell is not sufficient or otherwise they need to reuse the spectrum in a much smaller environment in terms of a much smaller cell.
But we absolutely endorse your first view which is macro sites are the first solution and that's why we own 40 000 of them.
Research Division</strong> And if I may just one last quick question.
When we go back to the PCIA trade show last fall and also this past spring I think one of the themes that emerged was that we're seeing a resurgence in actually new tower builds in the U.S.
Clearly off of a base of very minimal incremental tower build are you folks still experiencing that? Is it -- are you still seeing that in the marketplace? We're seeing a few opportunities.
I will tell you it goes back to Jay's capital allocation discussion.
We'll do them where we think we can make money.
It's usually the place where new entrants enter the market at initial yields on the asset that frankly we've been uninterested in pursuing.
So we may let others build some of those if those economics are not enticing to us.
We're going to do some this year.
Probably over the next 12 months I would guess 100 or maybe 150 but not material to really -- to our results.
Next we'll go to Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.
Research Division</strong> Two questions please.
The first is Ben I'd love to get a breakdown of sort of the drivers of growth in the quarter.
Historically you've kind of given us some perspective of amendments versus new cell sites and then what percent of that is falling under the MLA umbrellas that you have? And then my second question has to do with sort of the dividend growth story that Jay laid out which I think is very compelling.
And I was wondering if we might get a little perspective because you talked about the NOL roll off but maybe we get a little perspective on what's happening with the DNA.
By my records you guys bought 7 000 towers or I don't know 17% 18% of your portfolio in 1998 1999.
And I'm wondering how we might think about the DNA associated with that original sort of portfolio as we look at our projections and also try to understand some of the dividend distribution capabilities.
Sure on the first question around where we are with leasing it's very similar to what we expected for the full year.
There was about 10% of the activity that we're seeing that's following under the presold MLAs that we negotiated several years ago.
So there's very little of the activity that's falling under that -- those presold agreements.
In terms of the activity that we're seeing across all of the assets we're seeing in the neighborhood of about 3/4 to 80% of the activity coming from new tenant installations and the balance of it coming from amendments to existing sites.
We've seen that activity I would point out across all of the carriers and all of the portfolios including the 2 most recent purchases that we've had where we're already seeing some amendment activity that's driving site rental revenue growth across the portfolio.
So I know we've talked about that some in the past and that's -- it's coming about in about the same magnitude as we had expected going into the balance of the year.
Your question about the net operating losses and the depreciation that we see from a tax standpoint the tax depreciation is faster on an asset purchase than what it is for the GAAP statement.
And so as we have gone through the process and you rolled back all the way to our original acquisitions and then as you think about the impact to us from the more recent acquisitions the 2 recent acquisitions that we've done were in the form of prepaid leases.
So our payments out from a tax standpoint those are reflected against the cost to the asset or if you want to think about it as DNA costs.
Those are reflected across the term of those leases over 20-plus years.
So there's minimal impact to our NOLs as a result of those 2 acquisitions.
A simple way of thinking about it is we bought the assets on a 5% yield which if the cost is over 20 years then basically day 1 there's no NOL that's building and so each dollar of revenue and therefore margin that we add is going to effectively go against our net operating loss and reduce the amount of NOL that we've built over a period of time.
So as I look out over the next 5 years I certainly believe by 2020 given the pace that we're on with growth I think we will exhaust that NOL by then.
It may be -- depending on how the dynamics work out it may be a year to 2 years prior to that 2020 date just depending upon the flow of things like prepaid rent and other things that may affect that net operating loss.
But I think for modeling purposes without getting into much more detail than what I just walked through I think probably the best way to think about it is us exhausting it somewhere in that 2019 2020 time frame if the growth rate continues at the current pace.
And then if it accelerates our decelerates we'll kind of update that with you.
And we'll now go to Imari Love with Morningstar.
Research Division</strong> Just quickly back on small nodes you said it was a 6% of site rental rev.
Can we get a gauge of how the returns on invested capital compare relative to returns you're seeing on the macro sites? So you mentioned that the macro sites over 10 years it's around 15%; around 5% on the early end of that.
Can you give us a gauge of where small nodes fit on that spectrum? Sure happy to do that.
And that's really part of the enthusiasm that we share for that business.
As I mentioned if you think about the original acquisition of size where we spent $1 billion on the NextG acquisition at about a 4% yield we have borrowed through that to the point today where the entire sort of run rate of business is about a 6% yield on invested capital.
So you can then infer that the incremental business we've gotten past the acquisition is substantially above that.
As we go forward our expectation and what we're seeing is that the returns on this business we expect will exceed over 10 years what we've seen in the tower business.
And we are obviously very pleased with the results we've posted on the legacy assets as we talked about in the earlier part of this call.
But we're on a trajectory today with small cells and the anticipated co-location that'll happen in these very dense and attractive markets where we're building these systems that we think we'll frankly exceed by a significant margin what we've accomplished on the tower sites.
We'll now go to Batya Levi with UBS.
Research Division</strong> A couple of follow-ups.
Looking out to your estimates for revenue from existing customers it looks like you increased your projections for the next 4 years of about 2.5% to 2%.
Can you help us reconcile why we didn't see a similar increase in the site rental outlook for 2014 and how we can think about that versus the nonpercent organic growth that you're seeing today? Does that suggest that we should be expecting a similar organic growth for 2015? And the second question I had is as you go through the expected churn from iDEN what's your experience with Sprint's renewal activity for these towers? I also noticed that you slightly lowered your expectations for rental revenue from Sprint at time of renewals for future periods.
Can you talk about what drove that? Sure.
On the first question you will see those tables over the long period of time the increases we have leasing.
So those tables reflect actual leases under contract and we're not going to forecast that table for the forecasted growth during the calendar year.
So as quarters pass we would assume that the next 12-month forward or 2 years forward the revenue numbers in that table will increase commensurate with the growth that we actually achieved during the previous quarter.
So that table is not -- it's intended to be forward looking in terms of the contracts that we have on the books today but we don't adjust those contracts based on our expectation for growth over the subsequent period or multiple periods.
With regards to Sprint some of that is going to be the impact of the leasing they did in the quarter as well as the decommissionings that actually happened in the quarter as well as any extensions that we saw on those leases.
And those can come from simple things like if they amend a site and this would be true for all of the carriers.
There may be an amendment on a site and they may take out a lease over a longer period of time and it may adjust that table.
So in all likelihood as you're poring into kind of that detail it's a combination of the leases that happened in the quarter any nonrenewals that happened in the quarter as well as there could be extensions most likely related to things like an amendment on an individual site.
And we'll now go to Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to touch on -- back on Slide 11 I noticed that the yield increase for the T-Mobile and AT&amp;T assets it looks like you're basically targeting tenant additions but I also wanted to know if there's anything assumed in there with regard to amendment or escalation activity.
And then with regard to that can you also -- I apologize if I missed this but can you give us any idea of how long you may think it will take from a time standpoint to possibly move from that 5% to the 15% levels? As soon as we possibly can would be about all I can answer to the second one.
But in terms of -- if you look at the historical legacy sites that $90 000 of revenue per tower obviously includes amendments over time as well as escalations over time which all goes into that roll-up of that number.
We've elected to give you a simple metric not the only metric but a simple metric around tenancy because that seems to be helpful for people to be able to quantify to kind of get it around their -- in their head about how many tenants per tower and then what the opportunity is.
But over time obviously existing tenants and new tenants amend as well as escalate and that all contributes into that overall 15% yield on invested capital on those legacy sites.
And again to your timing question as soon as we possibly can.
That's about all I can tell you.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Well yes.
And with regard to that I noticed that the left-hand column obviously you owned and operated for greater than 10 years.
Getting the 15% has that been somewhat linear or more parabolic? It's over -- the average term that we've owned those assets is about 14 years.
It's been fairly linear over that period of time.
And I think one of the dynamics Michael when we talk about the business and there was an earlier question about do we see activity flowing in the first half or the second half of the year.
I think our observation would be that while it is common for people to look at our business and try to find inflection points where maybe the carriers are going to spend a lot more capital or spend a lot less capital as we look at our business over a long period of time the capital spend on our sites has been relatively consistent within a relatively small band of up or down.
And so as we look at our business we are left prone to try to find the inflection point and look more for themes.
And the theme to us is that the carriers are seeing tremendous growth from data and that is a long-term runway that we think is going to continue to drive site rental revenue and ultimately AFFO per share and that's how we've made the bulk of these investments over the last couple of years.
The only thing I'd add to that is while it may be tempting to think that those legacy assets are "full and done." As we continue to parse through our portfolio and look at it every quarter those legacy assets continue to lease at a very attractive rate and add additional revenue and obviously escalation off of a bigger number.
So they continue to grow and more than pay for their -- pay their way around here and that continues.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And one other thing I think you mentioned today as far as back at PCIA in the spring that there were some portfolios I believe you said at that time in Europe where some infrastructure funds had been outbidding yourself and perhaps some of the others.
When you look at these portfolios of assets can you help us understand where the disconnect or maybe not the disconnect but where the sticking point is where the difference in methodology when you value those portfolios versus some of the others who are obviously paying more? Yes.
Obviously I don't know what's behind other's view.
We can only speak for ourselves.
We come at it and look at what is the co-location opportunity in those markets.
How much capital will the carriers actually spend in those market.
That was our attempt in that one page today to talk about the relative scale opportunity in the U.S.
versus emerging markets or either -- even some other developed countries.
The U.S.
continues to just be enormous by comparison.
And so we look at the opportunity around lease up.
We also -- we look at the sort of inherent cost of capital and risk-adjusted return that you need to apply to an asset when you send a wire transfer into a different currency on that one day.
That's not dollar cost averaging in you're long that day but with very little variable input into the cost structure of our business.
So it's -- I liken it sometimes to find power plants in foreign countries you're sort of long that day.
So you have to put up a cost of capital differential into the currency at just sheerly from difference in currency risk and local borrowing rates in local countries are pretty good proxy to start.
So we put all that in the pot and walk through it.
And our result at the end of the day is we have found that either buying your own stock or buying assets in the U.S.
market tend to we think provide a higher risk-adjusted return on invested capital.
Others differ and disagree but that's our view.
And from time to time that causes us the pass on what would initially be a very accretive acquisition but we don't think that's the right sort of barometer for whether the acquisition is a long-term value creating for the company.
Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
LLC Research Division</strong> Two questions if I may.
The first one as you ramp up integrating the AT&amp;T portfolio and then obviously you've had the T-Mobile portfolio for now just over 1.5 years is it fair for us to assume as we go into the back of this year and then increasingly into 2015 -- and I'm not asking for explicit guidance by any means.
But is it fair to assume that we should start to see new leasing activity accelerate from this aspect alone? Just curious with that.
And then the second question is just on MLAs.
It seems like the logic for setting up those MLAs a few years ago seems to have now kind of run its course at least for some of the carriers.
What's the likelihood of renewing MLAs perhaps with different terms both on your end as well as on the carriers' end and when could we potentially see that happen? Okay on the first question Colby when you say -- when you ask a question about accelerating new leasing activity certainly on a consolidated basis we would expect that as a result of integrating these assets we will have more nominal dollars of new leasing activity coming in.
As you look at our supplement and the comments that I made around Organic Site Rental Revenue growth we have a base that is consistent.
So maybe a common term might be something like same-tower sales would be the closest thing to have our Organic Site Rental Revenue number.
As the AT&amp;T towers get into a 1-year vintage if you will they will go into that math.
And I'm not sure I would suggest to you that our organic growth rates will be higher as a result of that because you'll have a then larger base upon which we'll be growing.
But I think certainly on a nominal basis we would expect that the leasing activity will pick up at a consolidated level as we have those assets online and we're performing off the full suite of Crown services and leasing activities across the larger portfolio.
LLC Research Division</strong> On the MLAs? I mean just to punctuate that the 9% organic growth if that opportunity exists in the market as we certainly believe it does and that continues from -- on a multiyear track we'll be just fine.
In terms of your second question on MLAs Colby we'll look at it as facts and circumstances dictate as things come up as we always do.
And we try to be economically rational and make the right decision on what's going to result in the best outcome for us and the most expedient way to handle the amendment activity or desire of the carrier to get on the site.
So that goes together but it's -- we'll look at it facts dependent and I really wouldn't have any prediction today as to where that will take us in the future.
I think we would look at the ones that we've done today and feel like we cut very good deals and think we did better than the we otherwise would have in most cases so...
We do back check that and so far so good.
We're very pleased with the outcome there.
We're all living with today the flip side of the arrangement that we made with Sprint years ago related to the iDEN decommissioning that they indicated was coming to us.
And we saw benefit on the upside from the early days of network vision and today we look at that run rate and its about 6% roughly above where we were going into the process.
So we're feeling in the results today and will next year the downside of it the decommissioning side.
But on a net basis the result of that agreement was up about 6% from where it would have been otherwise.
So we do backward look at each of these that we've made and feel like in each case we've done really well.
And I think also from a carrier perspective their goal in doing those was to accelerate and speed up the process in which they've gotten on our towers and I think if you were to ask them I think they would indicate to you it certainly accomplished their goal as well.
And we'll take the next question from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.
So it seems like the cash -- tower cash flow margins have been declining sort of steadily over the course for last year or so.
Is the pressure all been a function of the investments you're making for the T-Mobile and AT&amp;T towers or are there other factors depressing margins there as well? And can you give us a sense for how quickly you expect margins to reinflate now that you're sort of at the end of the integration process with AT&amp;T? Yes Jonathan.
Yes the decrease that you've seen in our tower cash flow margins have all been a result of the acquisitions that we've made.
We've acquired 2 portfolios that had respectively 1.6 and 1.7 tenants per tower with T-Mobile and AT&amp;T so the margins on those assets were significantly lower than the legacy towers that we had that had margins in the high 70% range and 3 tenants per tower.
So as we put those lower-leased assets into the portfolio it lowered our overall margins.
I think most of that is basically in the run rate as I mentioned in my comments both on the expense side and the revenue side at this point.
And so absent any other acquisitions I think we'll go back on a pace where you see expanding margins on the go forward all driven by the amount of top line revenue growth that we have.
And that question will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
Research Division</strong> Ben do you think the networks are keeping up with the demand or is utilization increasing or decreasing? And is there much variability between the different carriers at this point? And then secondly maybe can you talk about it is there much shift in CapEx going on at this point? Like are we basically done with the fiber buildouts and a lot of the incremental CapEx is going to be more success-based antennas or lawn carts? Any thoughts there would be great.
Sure in terms of keeping up with demand just as a casual observer and listening to carriers' calls I would say no.
And from watching their behavior where they're going very very aggressively towards adding capacity you have to conclude no they're not keeping up.
And that's a good thing for us.
It's a good thing for them as a matter of fact because there's more ARPU out there to -- as the pie grows to argue over.
And so that's a good dynamic as the entire industry grows but just given the behavior and the speed and the pace in activity that we see I honestly don't remember it being any busier than it is right now for us.
So -- and that goes to really everything that we see whether it be services activity leasing activity.
Obviously we have this little integration going on which adds a little level of complexity for what we see.
And then the growing and building small cell side of the house we are as busy as we've ever been.
So I would have to conclude that that's going to continue for some time and is fundamentally a result of all of us as consumers continuing to eat a lot of bandwidth.
In terms of it being level smooth between all the different carriers I talked about that a little earlier.
It is a little bit different depending upon where the carrier is in their LTE deployment cycle and with Verizon and AT&amp;T being further ahead than Sprint and T-Mobile.
But that doesn't give us really any pause because I think the dynamic of the spend to capture that incremental dollar is true with all of the carriers and we fully expect them to come back and add density to their networks over time.
We're already seeing that just very beginnings with Sprint; we expect to see that with T-Mobile.
We're seeing some of those early conversations.
And then as I mentioned earlier in my comments that's very aggressively happening with Verizon and AT&amp;T right now.
Research Division</strong> And then on -- any shifts in CapEx spending? No.
I mean I think we see this as sort of a continuous program from -- for the foreseeable future; less sort of cycles and swings up and down and more of a steady pursuit of more and more bandwidth and capacity in these networks as -- whether you're talking machine-to-machine or tablet growth.
All these things that are expanding the usage of the network and expanding the revenue opportunity is a very good dynamic for our business and for the carriers and that's what's happening right now.
Research Division</strong> And I guess lastly you've been doing 17% AFFO growth per year.
This year's a little bit below too many acquisitions.
Do you think you can get back to the 17% level on a sustainable basis? Well I don't know about that.
But you'd have to at least give me credit for the dividend this year.
So the 13% would really be 15% if you added the dividend.
So we think that's pretty good given the acquisitions we've done and everything we're working on and the Sprint churn headwind that we had this year.
So if you were to adjust for the sort of the odd nature of the iDEN churn that number would be actually be 16% this year plus the dividend of 2%.
So look you can tell from the gross activity that we're pretty excited about what we see and we got a lot going on.
With that I think we'll wrap up the call.
I know there's a -- it's a very busy earnings week for everybody.
I appreciate you jumping on the call with us now for 70 minutes and look forward to seeing you at some conferences in the fall and on the third quarter call.
Thank you.
And thank you very much.
That does conclude our conference for today.
I'd like to thank everyone for your participation and have a great day.
Good day and welcome to the Crown Castle International Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.
Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Mr.
Son Nguyen.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you Devona and good morning everyone.
Thank you for joining us today as we review our third quarter 2014 results.
With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.
To aid the discussion we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.
This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions and actual results may vary materially from those expected.
Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the risk factors section of the company's SEC filings.
Our statements are made as of today October 31 2014 and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
And in addition today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.
With that I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Son and good morning everyone.
Thank you for joining us.
As we indicated in our earnings release last night I am pleased to announce that we have meaningfully raised our annual dividend from $1.40 a share to $3.28 per share starting in December of this year.
I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the reasons that led to this increased payout.
First we wanted to align the shareholder return with how the fundamentals of the business actually function.
We expect the recurring cash flow that our business generates will largely be distributed going forward in the current dividend.
Future dividends will benefit from the growth expected to come from a combination of contracted escalators leasing on our existing portfolios and external acquisitions that exceed the initial cost of capital and increase the dividend over time.
We expect that our AFFO organic growth rate over the next 5 years to be in the range of 6% to 7% 1/2 of which is currently contracted via escalators on our tenant lease contracts.
In any given year over 95% of our site rental revenues are typically under contract in the prior year thus creating a certainty we enjoy around dividend capacity of the company.
Second we believe this payout highlights and differentiates the $22 billion of high quality future revenues under long-term contract primarily with the 4 major U.S.
wireless carriers and our confidence in the sustainability of these cash flows as evidenced by this unprecedented commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.
Third we have retained sufficient liquidity to achieve the embedded growth opportunities that are in front of us.
As we've said on previous calls the primary driver of incremental value for us at this point resides in the lease up potential of the portfolio we already own most particularly the new 17 000 towers and small cell business that we have added in recent years.
Further this organic growth opportunity does not require a lot of capital to pursue.
We have sized the dividend to retain 25% of AFFO which we believe is necessary to pursue all of our organic growth plans and sustain the business appropriately.
We will continue to seek external growth through further acquisition opportunities when such acquisitions cover the cost of the new capital and allow us to increase the dividend over time.
Fourth we acknowledge that our organic growth rate in the future is likely to be lower than in the past partly because of the law of large numbers and the headwinds associated with the carrier consolidation on nonrenewals we expect over the next 3 to 4 years.
Thus we believe a larger component of our shareholders' total return appropriately should come from the current distribution of our very high-quality contracted revenues primarily serving the 4 national U.S.
carriers and our industry-leading position on mission-critical wireless infrastructure.
Essentially the way we think about our business is like a growing annuity of contracted bond-like recurring cash flows and shareholders will be receiving a current distribution that can be considered interest on the bond if you will backed by the $22 billion of contracted revenues I mentioned we have on the books plus growth from the embedded escalators in those contracts and increased utilization of our assets as carriers continue to invest in their networks to support the secular growth we are all familiar with in wireless broadband services.
The quality of this cash flow is represented by nearly 90% of our revenues coming from the 4 largest U.S.
carriers.
For context these carriers have a combined market capitalization of approximately $430 billion and annualized operating cash flows of $70 billion and a composite average cost of borrowing of about 4.5%.
As a pastor entity of these cash flows supporting the mission-critical wireless infrastructure of the 4 largest U.S.
carriers we believe the composite bond yield of our tenants is an interesting benchmark for evaluating Crown Castle's total return prospects.
Based on last night's closing share price the combination of a dividend yield of approximately 4% and expected long-term organic growth in the 6% to 7% range delivers total returns of 10% to 11%.
Of this expected total return approximately 2/3 is achieved via the current dividend and the contracted escalators under our tenant leases.
Fifth it has long been my belief that an eventual high payout of the recurring cash flow from arguably what is one of the best business models combined with expected growth in wireless would yield a lower cost of capital over time.
Further to this we are maintaining a balance sheet profile that is consistent with our investment-grade ratings objectives.
As has been our long-standing practice we have a very active ongoing dialogue about capital allocation and how we maximize long-term value for Crown Castle's shareholders.
Recently we spoke with and received feedback from many shareholders and several investment banks.
Opinions among shareholders and the investment banks were split between support for distributing a high percentage of our AFFO in the form of dividends and desire for us to maintain a lower payout and continue to retain more flexibility to purchase shares opportunistically.
We believe both camps have reasoned and thoughtful positions and we spent a considerable amount of time and analysis among ourselves and with our Board considering the appropriate approach for our business.
As managers of the business we find the perspectives of our owners on matters such as capital allocation incredibly advantageous.
We don't believe we have a monopoly on good ideas and therefore we welcome the conversation.
For those of our shareholders who would've preferred that we not raise the dividend so significantly in the short term we appreciate the effort and feedback that you provided and would hope that you would consider the rationale that we have articulated and why we believe that a greatly increased payout is the best approach.
Turning to our results.
I want to reflect for a moment on the year we're having as we head for the finish of 2014.
We have increased our 2014 outlook for AFFO to $4.20 a share representing 14% growth compared to 2013.
This growth has been achieved roughly from equal contributions from growth in our network services business and our growth in organic site rental margins.
I am very pleased with our results.
They've been accomplished even in the face of the initial headwind from the impact of the Sprint decommissioning of its iDEN network that impacted 200 basis points of AFFO growth in 2014.
We have provided 2015 outlook today that includes AFFO per share growth of 4% for the full year.
As previously disclosed impacting our growth outlook is approximately $65 million of nonrenewals from the final year of the Sprint iDEN decommissioning as well as approximately $40 million from network rationalization of Metro PCS Leap and Clearwire legacy networks.
Clearly this is a meaningful headwind but we were pleased to be able to forecast continued gross leasing activity that is driving double-digit organic growth before the impact of these network rationalizations.
Unfortunately based on our most recent conversations with T-Mobile Sprint and AT&amp;T we expect that the rationalization of Metro PCS Clearwire and Leap networks will continue to be a headwind to our organic growth beyond 2015.
Thus with this AFFO headwind beyond 2015 we would expect it to impact our long-term outlook resulting in organic growth expectations of 6% to 7% annually over the next 5 years.
We will keep you updated quarterly as we receive more details on the network rationalization plans.
Our growth expectations are driven by long-term industry fundamentals and 2014 is proving to be a year of continued healthy gross leasing activity.
Looking ahead to 2015 we expect leasing activity from new tenant installations and amendments to existing leases to remain robust and similar to our expectations for 2014 as all 4 major wireless carriers continue to upgrade their networks to meet consumer demand.
Towards that end we have deliberately focused our energy and capital in the U.S.
as we believe the U.S.
market offers the most compelling risk-adjusted returns where carriers have the most apparent economic incentive to invest in the world.
As you can see on Slide 6 the U.S.
market is uniquely attractive due to its relative size and robustness compared to other markets.
Further U.S.
carriers are able to generate incremental returns on their capital investment on a scale significantly larger than other geographies.
This can be seen by the approximately $600 in average annual revenues per subscribers that carriers earned compared to approximately $100 in annual investment per subscriber.
This relatively high ARPU is supported by the staggering growth in mobile data consumption by U.S.
subscribers.
As confirmation of the need to continue to invest in order to improve network quality and increase capacity and add functionality U.S.
carriers are projected to invest billions of dollars in the upcoming AWS and broadcast spectrum auctions.
These spectrum auctions in addition to spectrum that currently resides with wireless carriers that has not yet been deployed require wireless infrastructure to be deployed and thus provide a long runway of future demand.
Recent comments from wireless carriers who seek to continue to differentiate themselves based on network quality reinforce our belief in the long-term growth prospects of our business.
The reality is that there are really no limits to the opportunity wireless broadband holds for how we live our lives and benefit from connectivity never before imagined.
In the 1999 and 2000 era we purchased our initial portfolio of sites from carriers on an unproven co-location thesis with an initial yield of around 4%.
As you can see on Slide 7 today those sites have a yield of over 15%.
Today we are fielding familiar questions about the near-term results of our 2 large carrier tower acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 from T-Mobile and AT&amp;T which have initial yields of around 5% on these 17 000 towers.
It's early but we are very pleased with the early results that we've seen.
We are experiencing lease-up that we expected and are driving yields on these portfolios up as we had anticipated.
Jay will take you through some additional details on the growth of our recent acquisitions which are tracking with our underwriting models at the time of acquisition.
As the U.S.
market leader with nearly 40 000 towers and a very active and growing small cell opportunity currently at 14 000 nodes we are well positioned to benefit from these growing macro trends.
We believe the long-term prospects of the business have never been stronger with 4 national U.S.
carriers actively investing for growth in their business.
We have a long track record of creating value for shareholders and with the high-quality assets that we have assembled we believe we are poised to continue this record.
We maintain a long-term focus on the decisions we make and welcome the opportunity to differentiate our company with our significant commitment to return capital to shareholders while retaining all growth opportunities that are inherent in our long-term business plan and providing share wireless infrastructure to the wireless industry.
And with that I'd be pleased to turn the call over to Jay for some more comments.
Thanks Ben good morning everyone.
Turning to the financial results we had a terrific third quarter exceeding the high end of our previously issued outlook for site rental revenue adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
The robust leasing activity continued during the quarter and we look forward to closing out the year strong.
The results achieved during the third quarter allow us to once again increase our outlook for full year 2014.
Turning to Slide 8.
In the third quarter site rental revenue grew 21% year-over-year from $621 million to $752 million.
Organic site rental revenue grew approximately 7% compared to the same period in 2013.
The approximately 7% organic site rental revenue growth is comprised of approximately 4% growth from cash escalation in our tenant lease contracts approximately 6% growth from new leasing activity net of approximately 3% from nonrenewals.
On Slide 9 I want to spend a minute to break down the composition of year-over-year growth and organic site rental revenue and the leasing activity among our various asset portfolios we have owned for at least 1 year.
Our legacy U.S.
assets excluding the T-Mobile and AT&amp;T portfolios generated year-over-year organic site rental revenue growth of approximately 5% inclusive of the nonrenewal headwinds.
The 5% on our legacy assets compares to approximately 7% for the T-Mobile portfolio.
Given the lower tenancy a significant portion of this growth is driven by new tenant installations.
We completed the integration of the T-Mobile assets about a year ago and the assets continue to perform in line with our underwriting acquisition model.
We've substantially completed the integration of the AT&amp;T assets during this past quarter and we are encouraged by the leasing activity we are seeing on that portfolio.
The AT&amp;T portfolio's performance is comparable to the T-Mobile assets at this stage and is consistent with our underwriting acquisition model which assumes one tenant added over 10 years similar to our assumption on the T-Mobile assets.
While it is still early days on both the T-Mobile and the AT&amp;T assets we are confident in our thesis that we can create value by leasing these assets over time.
On the small cell front we continue to see strong adoption and growth.
Site rental revenue growth from our small cell networks is up approximately 30% year-over-year contributing approximately 7% to consolidated site rental revenues.
At the end of the third quarter we had over 6 000 miles of fiber serving over 14 000 small cell nodes on air under construction with 21 000 tenants residing on these nodes.
Currently we have over 3 tenant leases per mile of fiber we own or approximately 1.5 tenants per node.
In total these nodes are generating approximately a 7% yield on the total invested capital we have deployed to build or acquire fiber for our small cell networks.
The vast majority of the current small cell activity is being driven by Verizon.
However we believe the other carriers will follow over time adding small cell nodes across our fiber assets driving our expectations for returns on the investments we're making.
We continue to make investments in fiber to deploy small cell because we believe the investment will deliver attractive returns and increase our long-term dividend capacity.
On a unit economic basis we are generally seeing initial yields from the fiber we deploy for small cells of approximately 6% to 8% on the -- with the anchor tenant.
Similar to towers we see yields on our fiber assets being driven up into the low to mid-teens from additional lease-up and amendment.
Returning to Q3 financial results on Slide 10 adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter increased 21% from the same quarter in 2013.
This growth is attributable to the increase in site rental gross margin inclusive of the AT&amp;T towers and strong performance from network services.
AFFO for the third quarter was $350 million compared to $271 million for the same period a year ago an increase of 29%.
On a per share basis AFFO was up 13% increasing from $0.93 per share to $1.05 per share.
Turning to investments and financing activities as shown on Slide 11.
During the third quarter we invested $204 million in capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $17 million on our land purchase program.
We are on pace to complete nearly 2 200 land transactions during 2014 of which approximately 25% are purchases but the remainder being lease extensions.
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we look to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time.
Having completed more than 16 000 land transactions we believe we have the most secure portfolio of ground interest in the industry.
Today approximately 1/3 of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own and approximately 70% on land we own or lease for more than 20 years.
Where we have ground leases the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years.
We have provided more detailed information regarding the ground interest beneath our towers in our quarterly supplement.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we invested $167 million in revenue generating capital expenditures consisting of $99 million on existing sites and $68 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell construction activity.
We also spent approximately $20 million on sustaining CapEx which was below our third quarter 2014 outlook.
However we've not adjusted our full year outlook for sustaining capital expenditures as we expect to perform the same sustaining CapEx activities within '14 completing this work during the fourth quarter of this year.
During the quarter we also invested approximately $90 million in acquisitions primarily related to the acquisitions of ground interest underneath towers.
Further during the quarter we paid a quarterly stock dividend of $0.35 per share or $117 million in aggregate.
As of September 30 our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.3x.
Our weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.2% with a weighted average maturity of 6 years.
As Ben mentioned our decision to increase the dividend has further reinforced our views regarding maintaining appropriate leverage on the balance sheet.
We remain committed to staying on a path to an investment-grade credit rating and maintaining a target level of leverage of -- range of 4x to 6x.
Moving on to the 2014 outlook on Slide 12.
We have increased full year 2014 outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
The increase in the outlook is primarily driven by third quarter results an extension of the tenant leases with one of our major wireless carrier customers in Australia during the fourth quarter and expected higher network services gross margin contribution offset by a decrease in the assumed exchange rate from our previous outlook.
For 2015 as shown on Slide 13 we expect new leasing activity to be similar to 2014 offset by an elevated level of tenant nonrenewals.
Moving from left to right on the slide at the midpoint of our outlook new leasing activity or incremental revenue from new tenant installations and amendments to existing leases is expected to be approximately $145 million during 2015 as compared to $125 million for 2014.
Of the approximately $145 million in new leasing activity expected contributions from tower leasing and small cell leasing are $100 million and $45 million respectively.
The approximately $100 million in new leasing contribution from tower leasing represents over 4 000 lease equivalents on over 40 000 towers or approximately 0.1 tenants per tower.
As we've stated on numerous occasions our long-term view of this is that we can add approximately one tenant per tower over the next 10 years and we're right on track.
This 2015 growth is offset by the expected headwind from nonrenewals.
Nonrenewals for 2015 are expected to be between $110 million and $120 million.
Of this $110 million to $120 million we expect approximately $60 million to $70 million to come from Sprint's decommissioning of its iDEN network as previously announced.
In addition we would've expected 1% to 2% impact to site rental revenues from normal nonrenewals or approximately $45 million at the midpoint.
For 2015 we expect the normal nonrenewal bucket to be largely consumed by the beginning of the carrier consolidation nonrenewals as Ben mentioned.
Beyond 2015 we expect potential nonrenewals from the decommissioning of a portion of the Leap Metro PCS and Clearwire networks to be approximately $160 million of current run rate site rental revenues.
Based on our current understanding and the communication we've received from our customers we expect the impact from these nonrenewals related to these 3 networks in 2016 to be between approximately $60 million and $70 million and approximately $100 million in 2017 and beyond.
Our expectations for the potential impact from nonrenewals represent approximately 60% of the site rental revenues generated by Leap Metro PCS and Clearwire.
We do not expect any of the nonrenewals to come from our small cell networks.
We have provided additional details in our quarterly supplement.
Continuing with organic site rental revenue growth escalations on the existing tenant lease contracts is expected to be approximately $90 million in 2015.
New leasing escalations and nonrenewals combine to arrive at organic site rental revenue growth of approximately 4% or $120 million.
The $120 million in organic site rental revenue growth for 2015 translates to approximately $55 million in expected GAAP site rental revenue growth after making $65 million in adjustments for straight line accounting and exchange rates and other items.
The adjustment for straight line accounting removes the benefit of approximately $90 million in contracted escalators on the existing tenant leases and adds approximately $30 million in straight line revenues related to the new leasing activity including the tenant lease renewals that I mentioned before.
Moving to Slide 14.
Our 2015 outlook for site rental gross margins and adjusted EBITDA assumes an increase of approximately 6% or $60 million in cost of operations in general and administrative costs as compared to 2014.
All of the increase in expenses is reflected in the run rate expenses for Q3 2014 after accounting for the typical 3% annual increase as we have increased staffing during 2014 to accommodate an increase in small cell activity growth in network services and the expansion in the size of the asset portfolio.
Given the strong level of leasing activity and the agreements we have in place with our tenants we see continued strength in our network services business and expect it to replicate the operating performance of 2014.
We expect 2015 AFFO to increase to 100 -- $1.45 billion.
Of this $1.45 billion in AFFO we expect to distribute approximately $1.1 billion in dividends and use the remaining portion to fund the activities that drive our organic growth.
Let me summarize the year-over-year changes as it relates to AFFO.
As shown on Slide 15 beginning with the net leasing of approximately $30 million after nonrenewals plus the $90 million benefit from tenant escalations offset by the cost increases of approximately $60 million and other adjustments of approximately $10 million results in our year-over-year growth in AFFO of $50 million.
This simple layout is a good model for AFFO growth for future years beyond 2015 for our business.
As you consider 2016 for instance based on the information we have provided for nonrenewals and assuming leasing activity remains at current levels we would expect AFFO growth in 2016 to be approximately 6% or 200 basis points higher than that of '15.
As Ben mentioned over the next 5 years we target AFFO growth to be 6% to 7% organically.
To complete the picture this underlying growth in our existing assets frames our expectation for future dividends per share as we expect to increase the dividend commensurate with AFFO per share growth over time.
With respect to our dividend policy we believe the acceleration to a higher payout today appropriately balances providing shareholders with increased certainty for a significant portion of shareholder returns without compromising our ability to deliver long-term organic growth.
Since the early days of Crown Castle our long-term capital allocation goal was to distribute a meaningful portion of our cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends and we are pleased to realize that goal today.
With that operator be happy to open the call to questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
I understand some of the pressures on 2015 insurance and site revenue growth but I wanted to focus on the 6% 7% long-term growth and your comments on 6% AFFO growth in 2016.
You talked about the AT&amp;T lease-ups beginning to kick in in small cells I guess when you add up all of that I'm a little surprised that you're not thinking about new business picking up in 2016 and AFFO growth accelerating next year.
So I wanted to know if you just walk through the puts and takes of that.
Specifically your organic growth at 4% not picking up and I think that the dividend growth component is a big determinant of where the yield should be and obviously if there's a big difference between 6% and say 9% or 10% in a good year.
So just walk us through the puts and takes of '16 and beyond on sort of what -- you've talked about the churn I want to talk about the organic growth opportunities in some of the lease-up on the MLAs picks up and you have some capacity.
Sure Kevin this is Ben.
I'll start and Jay may jump in here in a minute.
As we think about 2016 Jay mentioned we could likely see a couple hundred basis points or so of improvement.
I'd break that down for you.
First on the expense line we certainly wouldn't expect to increase expenses again scaling as we have done in 2014.
So as that returns to a more normal sort of 3% growth rate even allowing for new systems coming on board on the small cell side I would think we'd pick up probably 100 to 150 basis points there of improvement to AFFO.
And then similarly as we've given guidance on churn our best estimate for 2016 at this point would be that we would see maybe 100 basis points or so less impact in 2016.
So that's the nature of the 200 or so basis points of pickup in '16 over '15 pro forma.
As you think longer term it goes to really -- to revenue and I want to talk about this real clearly for everyone.
Today at the current levels and our forecast for 2015 we're adding about $100 million of new revenue from new leasing on the tower portfolio that we have today and as Jay indicated in his comments that's equivalent to about 1/10 of 1 tenant on all 40 000 towers that we currently own.
We're quite comfortable with that.
That was sort of our underwriting model and I might add that's even continuing on some of the legacy -- many of the legacy towers we've had that are over 90 000 in revenue today per tower.
So the new assets are punching above their weight on a percentage growth basis because they're coming off of a smaller base but they are a smaller base and it's a smaller contributor to our overall revenue than the enormous base we have on the legacy portfolio today.
So in the vicinity of $100 million or so and even if that were to increase by let's just say 10% just to make up a number for you that's $10 million and that's not even 1% growth on AFFO.
So the numbers and as I mentioned in my comment not -- didn't take them lightly the law of large numbers here is definitely in play.
And so while the churn and the nonrenewals we've talked about is a short- to medium-term obstacle that we will get over.
The law of large numbers where we're adding call it $100 million to $150 million of AFFO a year going forward on a similar asset base obviously that's a diminishing growth rate every year and that's something to be appreciated and went into our thinking around how we structured the dividend and how we think about the long-term growth expectations.
Now clearly -- add 2 other points to that.
As the churn continues to lessen in outer years as we roll through this consolidation churn you would expect then to have more contribution to AFFO growth even on this $100 million or so on the tower side and maybe $40 million to $50 million on the small cell side.
And I would mention again we're getting very attractive initial yield from that investment in the small cells and significant co-location occurring across those nodes today as Jay mentioned.
So if you just assume that continues that's how you get to sort of the 6% to 7% over 5 years.
You certainly can appreciate if you start off at 4% and the second year might be 6% and we're suggesting to everybody that over 5 years it's sort of 6% to 7% obviously the back half of those years has to be better and that's our expectation.
But I do think it's important to ground everybody in the -- in sort of the law of large numbers around the organic growth opportunity or capability of the business.
It shouldn't be lost on anyone that the guidance we've given today of 4% AFFO growth which is inclusive of this outsized investment we've made in resources to accommodate the opportunity we see about 100 basis points of headwind there also has 700 basis points of churn in it.
So the organic engine if you will is in the vicinity of 11% or so and we're very very pleased with that but that's subject to this law of large numbers diminishment over time.
Finally last point.
No one should leave this call with any diminished view about our goal to continue to add assets through external acquisitions where it can cover the initial cost of capital obviously a dividend and interest expense to the extent it requires equity capital and new debt and then would be accretive to our ability to grow the dividend over time.
It'll be a very simple formula from this day forward because it's going to be very easy to figure out what the dividend component is and what the interest component is.
And anything we would pursue certainly would need to be -- would need to cover its initial cost of capital and be accretive to that growth rate over time or it would make no sense to do it.
So we believe that there will be opportunities to continue to grow the business and compound the growth against that new capital but for purposes of discussion on our 5-year plan as always we don't forecast those acquisitions until they're on the table and that's the guidance we've given you today.
Just a quick follow-up on the churn.
Is this -- your -- so on the acquired company churn in the out years have you gotten a request already from the carriers to -- for this plan? Or is this sort of your kind of worst-case scenario exposure aggregate exposure for those acquired companies? No Kevin.
This is based on very real-time significant conversations we've had with all 3 of those parent companies around their decommissioning plans over time and as it would impact our business.
I think in the disclosure we indicated that about $260 million of revenue resides on our tower sites today another 90 or so on the small cells.
Small cells are unaffected.
So it's upwards of close to 80% of our revenue on the tower side that we expect to be rationalized over time and that's coming directly from conversations we've had more than one with ongoing conversations we've had over this last quarter and subsequent to the quarter where we feel like in good faith we had an obligation to sort of bring those forward and -- as real-time information and put that in our forward outlook.
That could change.
Sometimes it does change but these are serious conversations and the carriers have actually spoken publicly on numerous occasions about their opportunity to realize synergies around these networks and you're seeing that here reflected in these numbers.
And we'll go next to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> I guess I have related questions.
The first one is Ben you set out a kind of 5-year game plan here it seems based on a series of kind of conversations that seem to be somewhat casual that have happened over maybe the last several weeks or a couple of months.
And it feels like this is a pretty significant reduction in the expectations for the future for a very long time based on a few conversations.
I guess the real question is do you see downside to what you're presenting here? Or are you presenting a pretty downside case? And as the world evolves as the world of wireless does there could conceivably be upside here? And then the second question is -- you mentioned obviously we're all wondering about the Verizon deal.
We were expecting that they're if you were to come to terms with Verizon there would have to be an equity component.
With your stock down and now the dividend cost of your stock being higher is the hurdle rate to do a deal any deal now greater if the stock were to stay where it is right now? Or in your own mind has your cost of capital not changed and you look at deals now the same way you would've looked at them yesterday? Sure.
On the nonrenewal discussion Dave we don't take this casually.
This is a material fact that we felt compelled to share with all of our shareholders and we realize it is a material change in our long-term sort of growth outlook and it was for us too as shareholders I can assure you.
We don't take it lightly and these are based on -- more than conversations these are based on significant sort of indicated plans and planning that they have shared with us including site-specific information and that's the nature of the conversations we've had and the seriousness with which we take it.
I don't think it could be much worse than this candidly and it could be better certainly it could be as carrier rationalization plans develop over time.
But the point I would make on the "it could be better." I would caution everybody on that because I would remind you that we continue to maintain a robust gross leasing outlook.
So we are continuing to expect that we'll add upwards of $100 million or so across the tower footprint every year which is a robust leasing environment that would encompass certainly these 3 parent companies continuing to invest aggressively in their networks going forward post rationalization or while they're rationalizing the legacy acquired networks.
So I'd say the -- on the -- the ad [ph] side of that on the gross side we've got a very robust expectation for leasing that we're going to work very hard to accommodate and accomplish.
On the Verizon tower transaction prospectively I don't have anything specific to announce about that.
Obviously Verizon would speak for themselves about their desire to divest their towers should that occur.
As we would think about a need to raise equity going forward on an acquisition in general we would as I mentioned in my notes we would look at any opportunity out there and view it as certainly the need to cover its initial dividend and interest expense and then certainly have a very significant and disciplined expectation that it adds to our ability to grow the dividend over time or there's really no reason to pursue it because we understand that the valuation of the firm going forward will be very much around the current dividend yield that the market will shake out and the expectation for future growth.
We've given you a view today that the organic ability of the company is in the vicinity of 6% to 7% over the next 5 years.
I would be quick to add that about 1/2 of that growth is already on the books today in the form of the contracted escalators we have across our company today.
So approximately 2/3 of the total return profile that we're suggesting to people is available on the existing asset portfolio today that we own.
Approximately 2/3 of that total return profile is already on the books and I think that's pretty compelling.
And we have every opportunity to continue our legacy of growing assets and creating additional value and we'll continue to pursue it that way.
Research Division</strong> If I could just ask one quick follow-up which is when you talk about the incremental $100 million of leasing revenue growth you gave us kind of a -- that's kind of a macro picture.
Is the -- can you talk about the small cell site outlet that you're baking into this 6% to 7% growth rate? Sure.
That would suggest a continued level of growth in and about the $140 million to $150 million total so an incremental $40 million to $50 million on the small cell side as well.
That's a mixture of co-locations on existing systems as well as investment at about this current level that we're seeing today with the retained AFFO as Jay mentioned in his discussion around our logic on what we are in fact retaining where we're able to continue to invest in the small cell side which are coming at attractive initial yields and provide great promise around total returns from co-location over time.
So that suggests that that would stay at about the current level.
And we'll go next to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> One easy question I think and on to the harder question.
Give you the easy one first.
The -- with the dividend thought process how did the NOLs fit into it? What happens to the value? Did you see value in the NOLs and what happens to it? That's the easy one.
The NOLs continue to have value for the company and there's -- the remaining to be I think maybe just shy of $2 billion by the end of this year Jay is that kind of where we think? We're burning them now obviously with the federal income tax net income so just shy of $2 billion.
When you work out Ric that math over the next sort of 5 years it's not a huge driver of value for the firm but it is interesting optionality that we will retain now by not essentially consuming very much of those NOLs going forward.
And so we will continue to have that.
It provides some flexibility for us on potentially an asset sale one day where we would shelter a gain but it's not a significant driver to the overall value of the stock and it was one that we were willing to sort of move to the back burner in terms of order of priority based on what we thought was the appropriate need or desire to have shareholders participate in this recurring and growing cash flow stream as we've outlined.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Makes sense.
We'd always held that on our model as like if you ever sold Australia that might be a nice asset to have around the NOLs.
It will be in our pocket.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> The more difficult question is I understand the law of large numbers I would say you guys have done a lot of portfolio additions but little bit back to the earlier question if you think about when you bought the AT&amp;T towers and the T-Mobile towers ballpark 1.6 1.7 tenants per tower versus much higher tenancy at your base portfolio or your legacy portfolio.
Remember here in the past that buying those carrier towers was like a big bet on co-location densification.
We've seen a lot of amendment activity heavy amendment activity lately versus co-lo.
Is this update to your guidance a way of saying also that that maybe the new co-los don't happen or it takes a much longer period of time.
So just trying to reconcile the big bet on carrier portfolios of low tenancy betting on densification hitting co-location and then this new kind of view.
What are your thoughts on that? I haven't changed my view and that's a great question.
We have as we mentioned when we acquired those portfolios we had underwritten approximately 1 additional tenant per tower over 10 years and we're tracking at that level.
But you're right to point out that that's based because there's not a lot of existing tenancy a lot of that has to be based on future co-location.
We expect that'll happen.
In fact we think there's a very strong thesis in the -- that we should have ultimately based on network demands have essentially every -- all 4 tenants on every one of our sites over time.
We don't underwrite it that way.
We don't put that in our guidance.
That's not in the 6% to 7% but if you think about the legacy portfolio how do you get to $95 000 of revenue per tower on the legacy sites after 12 to 14 years of marketing them? You get there by continuing to add tenancy and subsequent amendment activity over time well beyond maybe your initial underwriting.
That sort of falls in the category of the upside will take care of itself and so we don't put that into the model or into the discussion very often but we don't have any diminished view of that lease-up over time.
Jay did you want to...
Ric you can see in the numbers when I was talking in my comments about how the T-Mobile portfolio and the follow on to that is AT&amp;T how they've performed adding about 0.1 tenants is right about 7% which is right where the portfolio is performing.
So as you get into the law of large numbers obviously on a percentage basis that'll come down but it's tracking right in line with what we expected.
And on the T-Mobile and AT&amp;T assets we continue to believe that co-locations are going to be the biggest driver of that revenue growth.
I think for the quarter we were in the ballpark of about 65% of our leasing activity were co-locations from new leases and about 35% were from amendments to existing leases.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> But if we were to see a significant shift in the carriers being -- from amendment spending of their CapEx being new co-location that could lead to the upside of your numbers back to the sent [ph] the previous questions? Yes it could and right now -- as we've said on prior calls the most active co-locator in the industry today by a large margin is Verizon and I think that's been well documented.
Other carriers the other 3 are very aggressively still building LTE capacity into their network as well as beginning to show signs of hope happily from our perspective of adding new sites.
We're seeing that occur in all 3 of the carriers where they're coming back and looking at capacity infill sites which would be new co-locations and they talked about it in public settings recently.
Verizon for 2014 is the most active but we would expect over time the other 3 to return to co-location in a very aggressive way as they're adding capacity density in these networks which are required over time as they continue to add data services.
Ric I think one other way to speak about the portfolio and certainly it went into our thinking as we looked at the T-Mobile and the AT&amp;T assets was the diversity that we thought it brought to the company in addition to the growth.
So the legacy assets 24 000 assets obviously those are heavily more heavily weighted towards amendments to existing leases.
The new assets that we bought are more heavily weighted towards a belief around co-locations of new tenants.
So our experiences have been over a long period of time that there are ebbs and flows where carriers allocate capital towards one activity or another whether it's new leases or amendments and we feel great about the portfolio that we have.
And as we talk about our longer-term forecast we might see that move one way or another and maybe that means for some period of time either the legacy portfolios or the more recently acquired portfolios benefit from the whatever stage in the cycle the carriers are in but we like the diversity that we have in the mix so that we think we'll do well in both cycles.
And we'll go next to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> I just want to go back to the discussion around establishing what the payout was going to be.
How did you get comfortable that 75% was the right starting point? And then as you think about going forward what do you have to believe to believe that you could pay out a higher portion of your cash? And then lastly based on the redistribution requirements will you reach a point where you have to? You want to start with that Jay and I'll pick up the second part? Yes the second part of that of where would we reach from an NOL standpoint we have long believed that where we would end up is somewhere between 70% and 80%.
So basically our starting point is paying out effectively all of the taxable income.
I don't believe from an NOL standpoint we're going to get ourselves in a place where the dividend payout would be driven based on a need to pay out a higher percentage.
I think it's more likely that Ben probably wants -- may speak more to the rationality laid out in his prepared remarks.
But it's more likely we have a strategic conversation about that rather than being driven by taxable income In terms of the -- where we establish the payout Brett we really started with the notion of what do we need to retain to accomplish the organic growth expectations that we have on the existing assets that we currently own and that includes the current level of spend on the very productive investment we're making in small cells.
So we really started with that as an opening premise and we didn't put ourselves in a lot of risk on requiring us to raise outside capital to accomplish those growth expectations on an organic basis.
I think that's a very prudent and thoughtful approach and the rest 75% will now be in the current dividend.
Going forward there's a couple of things that we can think about in the future that could impact or make us reevaluate that payout and this is pure speculation because we're just starting out.
But as we achieve an investment grade rating and by definition you would have more access to capital through good markets and bad at even less cost than we're currently paying I think that would heighten our confidence level in reliance on the capital markets to fund some of these activities.
So over time we could consider and evaluate whether or not it made sense to raise the payout.
No commitment here on my part but that's something that would be reasonable to assume that we could evaluate once we have more -- once we have more certainty around access to capital.
We were certainly not willing to put ourselves in a position where we thought we were risking the growth opportunity accomplishing the growth opportunity in the company by needing to access outside capital to make the assets perform.
I think that would be irresponsible on our part here Day 1.
Over time as the market becomes -- as the shareholder base becomes I think more accustomed and more used to underwriting the sustainability of the dividend in this wonderful business we're in I think that will -- it'll be something that we'll continue to evaluate along with the investment-grade rating.
And we'll go to Colby Synesael with Cowan and Company.
LLC Research Division</strong> Great two questions if I may.
First off just as it relates to the timing of the terminations I'm just curious if the Metro PCS the Leaps and Clearwire if this is happening early in other words if they're going to be paying you some form of payment to end the contracts earlier than they otherwise would similar to what we're seeing with iDEN where I think they're paying you call it $12 000 a tower to do so or if they're actually waiting for their contracts to expire and that's why we're seeing it roll off I guess over the next 4 years.
And then my second question had to do with just your guidance specific to 2015.
When I look at new leasing activity in escalators specifically in both situations for 2015 when compared to what your guidance currently is for 2014 you're assuming slower growth and I'm just trying to understand what might be the reason for that.
That last statement real quick it's more growth.
LLC Research Division</strong> Yes well just specifically you're looking for 5.1% new leasing activity versus 5.5% in 2014 and for escalators you're assuming escalators are 3.3% versus this year 3.6%.
Colby on the second question I would point you to Slide 13 of the presentation that we showed.
We're showing that -- on a new leasing activity basis we're assuming in 2014 approximately $125 million of new leasing activity and for 2015 we're assuming $145 million.
So there's an actual pickup there of 15 to -- about 15% or so higher leasing activity in '15 than there is in 2014.
That obviously on a percentage basis though off of a larger base is going to be a lower percentage.
So if you're looking at percentages it's going to be lower.
On the escalator provision the primary driver for that is in the legacy portfolio as you're aware we signed a number of MLAs that had higher escalation provision.
It's how we accounted for the opportunity for these tenants to make additional amendments on the sites and so the escalators on those would be higher than the 2 acquired portfolios.
And as we roll in the AT&amp;T portfolio into the organic year-over-year comparison that escalator on a percentage basis is going to come down by just a touch there.
So that's the primary thing there but I think on an activity basis we're expecting slightly slightly more.
On the first question around the timing of terminations we're not embedding into this into our guidance any expectation that the tenants are going to be paying us early termination fees.
We're assuming that they live by the contractual obligations that they have and that the terms of the agreement hold up.
If as we go along you've heard us talk about the pay and walk fees that we had associated with Sprint as they were decommissioning their iDEN networks there may be some of that over time.
They'll have an obligation either to make the site back to the condition that it was prior to the equipment was installed or we would be happy to perform that service for them.
We're not forecasting that in our outlook but that would end up running through our services business and not through site rental revenues.
We typically think of that as one-time work and put that in site rental revenue -- and put that in services instead of in site rental revenue so.
But we haven't embedded any of that in our forecast over time.
LLC Research Division</strong> So right now the turndown of the sites is actually aligned with when the contracts [indiscernible].
Based on their contractual rights that's how we've done it.
So they're -- it's their -- let me just roll the clock back and make sure I give you a wholesome answer and one way to think about this.
When Sprint was looking at decommissioning their iDEN network years ago they ended up coming back and doing short-term lease extensions on some of their sites in order to -- because they weren't quite ready to decommission sites at a particular date and time.
What we have provided for you is what we believe based on what those 3 carriers have told us about when they're going to decommission sites and the amounts of those we provided that information to you.
That's our expectation of the $200 million.
That aligns with their contractual rights under the tenant leases that they have with us.
If they were to come back and extend that timeline or facts change then I think we would be open to having a conversation and we'll update you as those conversations proceed but what we've given you is a combination of their contractual rights and obligations against what they've told us about the decommissioning of the site.
And we'll go next with Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> This goes a little bit to a question a couple ago but can you help us think about the potential for CapEx and an expansion in 2015 under the 75% payout ratio? On our math and admittedly it's a little preliminary but it looks like you'd have to take CapEx down somewhat year-over-year or go out and borrow money which you said you don't want to put yourself in a position to.
Does it seem like there are fewer opportunities? Or am I just totally off-base? Yes go ahead Jay.
So we sized it as Ben mentioned.
If you look at what we spent in the third quarter for land purchases and the construction of new sites that's effectively 25% of AFFO.
The balance of the CapEx that we have is basically reimbursed by the tenants as they go on the site.
It's spending on CapEx on existing sites and that's basically reimbursed.
So at the current spending level using Q3 as the measure of that.
At the current spending level we can cover that CapEx with the 25% of AFFO.
Frankly that's one of the primary ways that we size the dividend at 75%.
Research Division</strong> Any more spending would probably be offset by preliminary or pre-fees that you don't count on AFFO anymore? Yes well I think it's -- to the extent that we grew the business and we started to say we wanted to invest more in small cells well that's a discrete investment similar to the way we would think about an acquisition and we'd need to go through that math.
I think the other as we think about a more normal CapEx that we would spend in the business as we add additional tenants for the sites that CapEx is absolutely reimbursed by the tenant.
Research Division</strong> And just to make sure I'm on the same page when you say that small cell is similar to an acquisition does that mean that you would borrow to fund that small cell business? You may need to borrow to fund that small cell business? Yes.
If we grow past the run rate of Q3 we would need to yes.
And be happy to do that to the extent there's opportunities that just like an acquisition as Jay said just like -- assuming the opportunity covered the cost we're not going to be too hard on that the whole point of not borrowing.
We've got balance sheet capacity and we'd be prepared to use it.
What I wanted to do in sizing the dividend is not put ourselves in a position where we had to do that just to capture the existing opportunity on our current sites.
And so that's what Jay was saying at the current spend level we're covered.
But to the extent the opportunity was there and warranted it we'd be happy to continue to access capital and borrow some just to cover that over time.
Research Division</strong> Great.
Okay I thought you were ruling that out a few minutes ago.
No no.
Glad for the clarification.
We'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Just wanted to clarify some of the comments you made early -- in some of the earlier questions.
We talked about this sort of $100 million sort of growth on the tower portfolio side and it does seem as though that if we do see an increase in co-location activity that could provide some further tailwinds for sort of an expanded opportunity there.
Is that the right interpretation of how we should think about things? Amir I would say about that as I was making a comment about the ebbs and flows that we'd see in the business typically and I would encourage you to look at this relative to the comments that the carriers are making around the CapEx and their spend in the networks there is a natural ebb and flow that happens between the spending they make for amendments and the spending they do for new leases.
Our experience has been the dollars and the spend on the networks is relatively similar year-over-year.
The allocation of where those dollars goes tends to change.
And so to the extent that you were to assume there was meaningfully more new co-locations being put out is there a possibility that that could mean more revenue to us? Absolutely.
It could also mean that the 35% of our current activity that is amendments that number may go down and may offset some of the increase that we see with new co-location.
So as we think about the business we tend to think about it more on a -- over a long period of time how much revenue per tower can we add and that 0.1 is adding about $2 400 per tower of new revenues.
And we have a belief that over time that will be a mix of new leases and amendments.
And our experience has been that that will change from year to year but sort of results in something that looks similar to that 0.1 tenants per tower.
Research Division</strong> If I may one other quick question on the small cell side.
If we hear what the carriers are saying particularly when it comes to allocation of capital more towards densification and capacity type initiatives it does feel as though we should start to see potentially increased momentum around that front.
You had mentioned there's been -- largely Verizon has been focused on that but clearly it does seem like all the carriers at some point in time are going to embrace this type of network architecture.
How should we think about the opportunity set for accelerating growth on the small cell side given your footprint within that arena? Amir this is Ben.
We think that's a tremendous opportunity and one that we are actively working on capturing for Crown Castle.
We have a very large and growing pipeline of network opportunities to be built as well as co-location and I do agree with you and it's certainly our investment thesis that we will see the other 3 carriers adopt that architecture in a very meaningful way over time based upon the capacity requirements of their systems and the locations of where we're building these networks.
That has happened over time various carriers and we still have -- we have a significant amount of exposure and revenue.
As we said earlier Metro PCS for example now under T-Mobile all of those leases are -- have been affirmed and don't expect those to churn which is I think an interesting indication of the value of the small cell networks going forward in that these are very vital to adding capacity and densification and are not subject at least thus far to the rationalization that we've seen on the tower side.
And we'll go next to Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
Research Division</strong> Two quick ones and then a longer one sorry.
The AT&amp;T transaction would that have met your interest in dividend requirements as you currently define them with the new dividend? Secondly your investment bankers really had weeks to look into transaction and we just had couple of hours.
Did they kind of tell you what they thought the dividend yield would settle out at when the market kind of really absorbs all this? And then third the longer question here really investors had been really nervous about shutdowns of cell sites and consolidation and it didn't seem like the management suits [ph] in the industry were as nervous about it.
What has really changed that from your thinking kind of things 6 months ago 3 months ago or what we've seen historically? Historically we've never really seen shutdowns like this.
Yes on the first question the AT&amp;T transaction would have met that and we believe that would be accretive to the dividend over time.
We wouldn't have done the transaction if we didn't believe the dividend was going to be higher.
As Ben mentioned on the investment banker views that we got we engaged and asked several firms to give us their views those views were ranging in terms of what they -- how they thought the market would react to the news as well as their opinion on what the best approach was.
I think that there was a whole variety of views there and as we looked at the information and consider both the feedback from shareholders as well as the information that we generated and analysis we did on our own our belief was that increasing the dividend to about 75% of AFFO was the best outcome for us over a long period of time.
And so there were a number of views there as Ben mentioned in his comments but we thought it was the best approach.
Tim in terms of specific yield we'll let the market sort that out and tell us over time.
I would offer the following observation though.
We're currently trading this initial yield as of last night and that's about a 4% yield.
That would put us above the REIT composite by a significant margin and I like my new REIT colleagues but I wouldn't trade places with their business models.
And so when I look at our opportunity for stability and growth as the mission-critical infrastructure provider in the U.S.
market I think that's a fabulous business model and as we've said a couple of times on this call and I'll repeat the fact that we got built-in growth on top of that dividend I think is clearly unique and the market will sort out what the appropriate dividend yield is over time and the total return expectation but we'll certainly be out working to help them understand the resiliency and the sustainability of this business through lots of different macroeconomic cycles where back since we went public initially we've outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by sort of 4x and that's right through all of the different cycles that we've experienced since that time.
In terms of your last question on the churn what's different this time I think it is a little bit different this time.
As you go forward there is rationalization that can occur in these networks particularly around overlap sites plus a little more which is what we're forecasting.
And yet at the same time we're seeing continued new cell site density added which is forecasted in our revenue growth as we've talked about.
So I think we've probably accurately captured it.
You could say well leasing may be a little lower if they're actually just repurposing some of the cell sites that's true.
But on a net basis I think it probably comes out about where we've said.
So we'll have to wait and see how that develops over time but I think it is a little bit different particularly in that we have 3 happening here in fairly -- much on top of each other.
There seems to be in the comments and at least what they're indicating to us is their plans around their networks more of a focus on spectral efficiency than what there's been in past consolidations.
And so that's likely the reason why we're seeing more than the overlap sites go away.
T-Mobile's comments publicly about the Metro sites.
I think Metro has about 12 000 macro sites.
T-Mobile has indicated that 10 000 of those 12 000 are going to go away and their description along with the other's descriptions is largely around reharvesting and reusing that spectrum in a more efficient way by taking down greater portions of the network than what we've seen in past consolidations.
Research Division</strong> And any idea why American Towers is not seeing the same effects that you guys are? I wouldn't have any comment on American Tower.
You'd need to ask them.
We'll go next to Batya Levi with UBS.
Research Division</strong> You touched on this before but I wanted to get a little bit more specifics on the split of the churn coming from the acquired networks.
Is the majority coming from Clearwire I think and is it mostly the urban market? I think you had mentioned before that the contract was going to be up for renewal I think in '15 and '16.
And when you look at the PCS T-Mo I believe you had mentioned that the overlap is about 2% of your revenues and you had a contract until '17.
AT&amp;T Leap was similar so you did mention that the rationalization piece is a little beyond overlap.
So can you maybe provide a bit more color on what is included in the overlap and what do you think is beyond that? I wouldn't put the majority on any one of those tenants.
The ranges that we provided we intentionally didn't go customer by customer on the ranges.
It gives us that a little bit of flexibility as it shakes out over the next several years as those 3 operators decommission their networks.
We would expect it to move to some degree which is why we tried to ban the exposure.
As you noted when those announcements were made we indicated the overlap sites was in the neighborhood of about $145 million of sites that were overlapped.
So the incremental amount of roughly $55 million of additional churn exposure that we believe we have those would be on sites where they're not necessarily -- where they're not overlapping with the acquired network.
And my comments to the prior question around spectral efficiency I think probably best answer the why there.
In the disclosure that we had previously given we gave the average term outstanding for the leases.
And so as we kind of work through that obviously you can see that average basically work itself out as we've shown over the longer period of time what our exposure is to those 3 networks.
And we'll go next to Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest Investment Bank.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions here.
I'm trying to figure out first of all with regard to the dividend was there any thought process around rather than returning capital to shareholders.
Rather than doing that maybe spend on targeting acceleration in that 0.1 per year for the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile portfolios? And then #2 does this now make you guys start to think a little bit about international investments more seriously? Because clearly we're seeing higher growth rates organic growth rates in international than we are here in the U.S.
I don't know where to start with that.
I didn't catch the if you spend to increase the leasing boy if it was that simple we would have done it 15 years ago.
There's no discretionary spend on our part that is inhibiting the leasing of the carrier towers or all the towers that we own today.
So it's -- we're actively out pursuing every one of those opportunities and that's what's resident in the $100 million of revenue growth that we're seeing today Michael.
So the dividend again how we sized it was essentially to retain the capital to pursue the organic opportunities that we see today.
The international opportunities that are out there we'll continue to evaluate them as I've said on these calls many times against the appropriate sort of risk-adjusted rate of return we think and -- is appropriate against the asset prices that are out there.
In so doing you have to look at what local borrowing costs are what exposure to FX would potentially do and all the other factors that would involve an evaluation such as that.
Thus far in our judgment the investments we've made in the U.S.
have a higher risk-adjusted return profile opportunity but we'll let that sort itself out over time.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Yes and where I was going with the first question was whether there's anything that you guys could put in place rather than paying a dividend to use that capital rather to increase the tenant per tower the incremental increase on a per year basis is there anything that you contemplate or any thoughts around things you could do to accelerate that? It sounds like the answer is no but that's where -- Yes no.
That we -- I can assure you we're capturing every one of those incremental revenue opportunities.
That's our core business and what most everybody that works here is focused on every day.
But just to be complete the competing thought that we had lots of discussion with shareholders and we've engaged in this in a very productive way before would be to take the $1.1 billion of dividends we're now going to pay out and buy shares with it retain the flexibility until the NOL has burned off and buy shares opportunistically with it.
Potentially like on a day like today when we announced that there's $200 million of churn coming.
So we specifically rejected that.
We understand how that drives on a per share basis higher growth in the short term but we think long term the right approach was to demonstrate the sustainability through the quarterly return of a material part of this cash flow to shareholders and have a very significant component of their total return be made up by the current distribution plus the contracted escalator growth and then the opportunity that we see to continue to add organic and external growth in the business.
But that would have been the competing agenda and one we respect and one we've executed very successfully.
In the past we've bought $2.7 billion worth of stock over time but the course we've set for the reasons that I mentioned in my notes at the beginning of this call we think is the best long-term approach for the company.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And just very quickly do you guys have an expiration schedule for the NOLs? Is there an average? Or do you have a ladder that you can share with us? Yes they started between 2020 and 2030.
The average is about 2025.
And we'll go next to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.
I was wondering if you could just point us to any time frame for signs we can look for an acceleration in your overall organic growth from the AT&amp;T or T-Mobile towers that you're seeing? I think if you asked us today as we mentioned are performing in line with our underwriting model.
We took a 10-year view on those models and they're performing right at about the average that we expected over 10 years and out of the gate are right there so we're not anticipating or frankly do we need to anticipate an acceleration of activity in order to get to our returns.
So our game plan is to continue to run the asset as we've been doing out of the gate and that will provide a terrific return.
But it's early days.
And as I mentioned earlier on this call the primary co-locator in this market has been Verizon since we've owned these 2 new portfolios and so as we would expect and certainly as we underwrote we will return to a period of time I think we're already been beginning to see it where the other 3 are going to need to infill their networks with increased density where these portfolios will certainly be available for them to do that.
So that's part of our underwriting thesis.
Got it.
And I guess if I look at your organic revenue growth guidance before decommissionings it looks like you're implying a modest slowdown from where you came in this past quarter and I would've thought that excluding the negative impacts of churn we'd see an acceleration into next year.
Yes.
Quarter-to-quarter they're a bit challenging to do.
I would tell you typically in the back half of the years we see more activity than in the front half.
So I would encourage you to look at things more on a holistic full year over full year basis.
We're forecasting as we've mentioned a couple of times on this call full year '15 to look pretty similar to full year '14.
Well up about a little bit higher.
Yes up about $20 million off of '14 numbers.
And we'll go next to Ana Goshko with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to ask you you continue to mention the goal of achieving an investment-grade rating but wanted to understand what you believe or what you know from conversations with the rating agencies what the catalyst is to achieve that because you are at your target leverage ratio with a muted growth outlook at least in the near-term the EBITDA metrics will not be improving and then with a higher dividend there's really not cash left to pay down debt in any material fashion.
Honestly it's the decision of the rating agencies as to where they place our ratings on the credit facilities and the conversations we've been having with them over several years is the same conversation we've had on this call this morning and have for a long period of time around the risk profile of the assets the stability of the cash flows and where that should be rated.
I think relative if we compare ourselves to other real estate businesses we feel like our credit statistics are very favorable and the rating agencies over time have embraced that view and we have seen them gradually increase the ratings and increase the appetite for leverage on these businesses which we think is appropriate.
We don't anticipate and you've correctly pointed out we don't anticipate taking a significant portion of our cash and paying down debt but we do expect the business to continue to grow and so we'll achieve deleveraging of the business just through natural growth and EBITDA rather than the pay-down of debt.
And we certainly on the call this morning wanted to make the comment and the statement that as we think about our dividend payout increasing the dividend payout meaningfully we think as an important component of that is to stay on this path that we've been on towards achieving an investment-grade credit rating and that's certainly our intention and plan at this point.
And part of our analysis that we reflected on earlier in the call was that in order to get -- and it's been a long-held view we've had in order to get the maximum appreciation and value out of this dividend stream that we're now undertaking an investment-grade rating is probably the right way to accomplish that over time.
As Jay says we don't expect to do anything unnatural to get there but I think we'll get there over time through continued growth and I think that's the right way to think about the business.
Research Division</strong> I have 2 follow-ups.
So one do you believe that the increase in the dividend from the agency standpoint has sort of set you back? Or are you still on the same path or the same place on achieving the rating? No I don't think it set us back.
I think the communication we're having with them on this is similar to what we said on this call that we intend to continue on the path towards an investment grade credit rating and deleveraging as we see growth in EBITDA and so that's sort of the plan.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then secondly Jay you did say publicly and very theoretically on the potential to acquire the Verizon assets that if that were the case you would be willing to take leverage back up over the 6x target at least temporarily.
But with the higher amount of cash flow that's going to be supporting the dividend wondering if that's still the case.
Yes.
I think all of those comments still hold.
If we were to take leverage up that would be -- well start if we were to do the transaction we would have to believe that's accretive to the dividend and to AFFO per share over a long period of time.
And we'd expect that that would be the case frankly in both the short and the long term.
The second part of it around how we would finance it I think we would still be open to taking leverage up to the high end of our targeted level of leverage range maybe slightly above it.
However the only way we would be interested in doing that is if we had a plan to quickly delever back down to where we've been aiming towards to -- in your prior questions around an investment-grade credit rating.
So I think if -- we would be open to doing that.
We think the Verizon towers could represent a very unique opportunity in the U.S.
market.
There are not we don't believe very many U.S.
assets left of any substantial size.
So if that were to happen we think that's in a sense a bit of an anomaly and a really unique opportunity.
So if it were there we'd have to consider the appropriate way to finance it and I think on the table in those conversations would certainly be a thought around leverage.
I think with that we'll wrap up.
We've gone long this morning and I appreciate those that have stuck with us here.
We wanted to make sure we captured all of your questions.
We are very excited about our future prospects and today I think is a very important day for Crown Castle as we've now proceeded with it.
What I think is an unprecedented and unique opportunity for shareholders to invest in the U.S.
wireless business with us an infrastructure that will carry a very significant and growing current return and we are very pleased with how we're positioned.
So thank you for your attention this morning and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Thank you.
This concludes today's conference and we appreciate your participation.
Good day and welcome to the Crown Castle International Q4 2014 Earnings Call.
Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you Carla and good morning everyone.
Thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results.
With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer and Jay Brown Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.
To aid the discussion we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our Web-site at crowncastle.com which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.
This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions and actual results may vary materially from those expected.
Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's SEC filings.
Our statements are made as of today January 22 2015 and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
In addition today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the Company's Web-site at crowncastle.com.
With that I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Son and good morning everyone.
Thank you for joining us on this call.
As we indicated in our earnings release last night we had another great quarter finishing 2014 on a very strong note allowing us to increase our full year 2015 outlook which Jay will speak to shortly.
In addition to the excellent financial results we had several major accomplishments during the year that position us very well for 2015 and beyond.
First we have successfully completed the integration of the AT&amp;T tower portfolio with 9 700 sites and are now seeing healthy application volume on these assets.
The AT&amp;T tower transaction represents the sixth carrier portfolio we have acquired in our Company's history.
As shown on Slide 3 we have a portfolio of approximately 40 000 towers.
Over time we've accumulated a long track record of integrating and leasing our assets and delivering growth through various economic and industry cycles.
We believe we are well-positioned and on our way to delivering the same results with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile portfolios as has become our track record.
Similar to our acquisitions in the late 1990s and early 2000s we acquired the AT&amp;T assets and the T-Mobile assets at initial yields of approximately 5%.
Long-term we believe we can drive the yield on these recently acquired assets to similar levels as our legacy assets which currently yield approximately 15% on invested capital.
The AT&amp;T and T-Mobile assets represent approximately 40% of our tower portfolio and provide an excellent opportunity for us to extend our runway of growth.
Second during the year we meaningfully increased our small cell networks portfolio and capabilities.
Small cell networks have similarities to towers including the same customer base the growth drivers and similar contractual terms.
Small cells are playing an integral role in solving capacity and coverage issues in areas not traditionally served by towers.
Today our team is executing extremely well and we are focused on delivering on a growing pipeline.
Currently a significantly majority of our small cell activity is being driven by Verizon.
However we are pleased that we are starting to see increased interest from other carriers to add small cell nodes across our fiber assets.
Our acquisition of NextG in 2012 cemented our leadership position in small cell networks.
At the time of the acquisition we had a stated goal of increasing adjusted EBITDA from small cells by 5x to 6x over the next five years.
I'm happy to report that we are on pace to well exceed this goal.
Third at the beginning of 2014 we commenced operations as a REIT and initiated our first dividend.
Subsequently during the fourth quarter we meaningfully increased our dividend to a quarterly dividend of $0.82 per share or $3.28 per share annually.
On this last point I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing how our core business supports our commitment to the dividend and how we intend to grow our dividend over time by leveraging the investments we have made over the last several years along with potential future investments.
We believe delivering a portion of shareholder returns through dividends aligns well with the fundamentals of the business.
The wireless infrastructure assets that we own and operate whether towers or small cells are characterized by high-quality long-term recurring cash flows that are well suited for committed shareholder distributions.
As shown on Slide 4 today we have about $22 billion of future high quality revenues under long-term contract primarily with the four major U.S.
wireless carriers.
For context these carriers have a combined market capitalization of approximately $415 billion and an operating cash flow of approximately $75 billion and a composite average borrowing cost of about 4.5%.
The quality and contractual nature of our tenant leases provide us with great visibility.
In any given year over 95% of our site rental revenues are typically under contract as of January 1.
Over time we expect to increase our dividend commensurate with the rate of AFFO growth.
Future organic growth is expected to come from a combination of contracted escalators leasing on our existing portfolios and investment opportunities that are additive to our long-term growth.
We expect that these three avenues of growth will combine to generate AFFO growth over the next five years in the range of 6% to 7% of which half is currently contracted via escalators on our tenant lease contracts.
Based on last night's closing share price the combination of a dividend yield of approximately 4% and the expected long-term organic growth in the 6% to 7% range delivers total returns 10% to 11%.
Of this expected total return approximately two-thirds is achieved via the current dividend and the contracted escalators under our tenant leases.
Frankly we believe this expected total return of 10% to 11% sells our business model short.
As we look at some comparables such as the RMZ index which has an average dividend yield of 3.5% and arguably lower growth we believe our superior business model should attract a lower cost of capital over time.
This belief is based on our intentional strategy of avoiding volatile assets with risks such as foreign currency and country risks into our high-quality portfolio thus giving us the confidence to make the commitment that we have made to a significant return of capital to shareholders.
Fundamentally we view our dividend as a growing annuity paid to shareholders in the form of contracted bond-like recurring cash flows plus the conversion of future growth opportunities that are supported by the increasing demand for wireless broadband services.
As effectively a flow-through entity or conduit of these cash flows supporting the mission-critical wireless infrastructure of the four largest U.S.
carriers we believe that our expected total return of 10% to 11% compares extremely favorably to a composite bond yield of our tenant customers of 4.5% as I mentioned.
When we talk about the mission-critical nature of wireless infrastructure assets we are referring to Crown Castle's role in enabling the U.S.
wireless carriers to deploy mobile broadband.
Carriers utilize our infrastructure to support service to their subscribers.
As a result our long-term growth potential is driven by the dynamics that play out between the wireless subscriber demand for mobile broadband and incremental economics that carriers can achieve by investing in their networks.
Towards that end we believe our focus in the U.S.
where carriers have the most apparent economic motivation to invest in the world will drive compelling risk-adjusted total shareholder returns over time.
As you can see on Slide 5 the U.S.
market is uniquely attractive due to its relative size and robustness compared to other markets.
The size of the U.S.
market is supported by the high average revenue per user reflecting the insatiable demand the U.S.
wireless subscribers have for mobile data.
For context a year ago the average smartphone user consumed 1 gigabyte of data per year.
Today it is estimated that the average smartphone user consumes 2 gigabytes of data per year.
So what took six years to build up to starting with the original iPhone has taken just one year to double given today's devices and applications.
This increasing demand that U.S.
consumers are placing on the carriers' networks and the consumers' willingness to pay for such services incent the U.S.
carriers to continue to invest to improve and enhance their networks.
As carriers continue to compete on the quality of their networks such investments help maintain and drive up ARPU encourage new device and application adoption and minimize churn.
The carriers' ability to generate incremental returns on their capital investment can be seen by the approximate $600 average annual revenues per subscriber that U.S.
carriers are earning compared to approximately $100 per annual investment per subscriber that they are making.
Relative to other countries U.S.
carriers have opportunities to invest and generate returns at a much larger scale.
The ongoing AWS-3 auction further reinforces our belief that U.S.
carriers have a long-term and positive view on mobile broadband services.
These spectrum auctions in addition to spectrum that currently resides with wireless carriers that has not yet been deployed require wireless infrastructure to be deployed and thus provide a long runway of future demand for our portfolio of assets.
As the U.S.
market leader with nearly 40 000 towers and a very attractive and growing small cell opportunity currently at 14 000 nodes we are well-positioned to help the U.S.
carriers meet the growing demand by consumers for mobile broadband services.
Before turning the call over to Jay I want to take a brief moment to thank our team of Crown Castle professionals who have worked tirelessly during 2014 to make it such a successful year and I look forward to another successful year in 2015.
And with that I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jay for some more comments.
Thanks Ben.
Good morning everyone.
Turning to the financial results we had a terrific fourth quarter exceeding the high end of our previously issued outlook for site rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
The strong leasing activity continued during the fourth quarter and we believe that 2014's level of leasing will be sustained during 2015.
The combination of excellent results and completed acquisitions during the fourth quarter 2014 allow us to increase our full year 2015 outlook.
Turning to Slide 6 in the fourth quarter site rental revenue grew 17% year-over-year from $651 million to $761 million.
Organic site rental revenue grew 7% year-over-year comprised of approximately 4% growth from cash escalations and our tenant lease contracts and approximately 7% growth from new leasing activity net of approximately 4% from non-renewal.
As can be seen on Slide 7 our organic site rental revenue growth has been enhanced by the investments we have made over the last several years including in the T-Mobile portfolio and small cells.
Our legacy tower assets excluding T-Mobile AT&amp;T and small cells generated year-over-year organic site rental revenue growth of approximately 4% inclusive of non-renewal headwind.
The 4% growth in our legacy U.S.
tower assets compares to approximately 6% for the T-Mobile portfolio.
While we didn't present the AT&amp;T portfolio here on the slide because it wasn't owned for the entire 12 month period the AT&amp;T portfolio's revenue growth is similar to the T-Mobile assets after a similar period of ownership.
And based on our underwriting assumption of adding one tenant over 10 years the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile portfolios have added approximately 200 basis points to our expected long-term dividend growth target that Ben mentioned which is 6% to 7% compound annual growth over the next five years.
Turning to small cells we continued to see healthy growth.
Site rental revenue from small cell networks is up approximately 30% year-over-year contributing approximately 7% to consolidated site rental revenues.
At the end of the fourth quarter we had over 7 000 miles of fiber serving over 14 000 small cell nodes on air or under construction.
We believe our strategically located fiber will continue to see meaningful addition of tenant nodes thereby driving yields higher over time.
We continue to make investments in fiber to deploy these small cells as we believe the investment is delivering attractive returns and will increase our long-term dividend capacity.
On a unit economic basis we are generally seeing initial yields from the fiber we deployed for small cells of approximately 6% to 8% on the anchor tenant.
Similar to towers we see these yields on our small cell networks being given up into the low to mid teens from additional lease up and amendments.
Turning to the investments and financing activities as shown on Slide 8 during the fourth quarter we invested $267 million in capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $40 million in sustaining capital expenditures which included approximately $3 million that was previously expected in our full year 2015 outlook but was accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2014.
Additionally during the quarter we invested $35 million in land purchases.
During 2014 we completed over 2 500 transactions of which approximately 30% were purchases with the remainder being lease extensions.
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business and as we look to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time.
Having completed more than 17 000 of these transactions we believe we have the most secure portfolio of ground interest in the industry.
Today approximately one-third of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land that we own and approximately 70% on land that we own or lease for more than 20 years.
Where we have ground leases the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years.
More detailed information regarding the ground interest beneath our towers is available in our supplemental information package.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we invested $192 million in revenue generating capital expenditures consisting of $91 million on existing sites and $101 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell construction activity.
Further in the fourth quarter we also invested approximately $286 million in acquisitions.
This primarily related to the acquisition of ground interest underneath towers.
During the quarter we also paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per share or $274 million in aggregate.
As of December 31 our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.4x.
Our weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.1% with a weighted average maturity of six years.
Additionally since the end of the quarter we increased our revolving credit facility by $630 million.
Our revolving credit facility now totals $2.1 billion of which we have approximately $1.4 billion available.
Moving on to the 2015 outlook on Slide 9 we have increased our full year 2015 outlook for site rental revenue by $11 million half of which is organic and AFFO by $8 million at the midpoint.
The increased outlook reflects the strong results and completed acquisitions from the fourth quarter 2014 and includes the negative impact from the decrease in foreign exchange rate assumptions related to our Australian business.
We completed several acquisitions during the fourth quarter 2014 which did not materially contributed to the full-year 2014 results and are expected to contribute approximately $5 million to AFFO in full year 2015.
We expect to generate approximately $1.46 billion in AFFO at the midpoint of our 2015 outlook.
Of this amount we expect to distribute approximately $1.1 billion in dividends and use the remaining portion to invest around our core business to drive our organic growth.
These investment activities include purchases of land underneath our towers and construction of small cell networks.
We believe the combination of continued investment in our core business the high-quality contracted cash flows generated by our tenant leases with built-in escalators and as Ben mentioned the need for our wireless infrastructure as carriers continue to improve their networks position us to achieve AFFO and dividend growth of 6% to 7% organically on a compounded basis over the next five years.
We believe our strategy of focusing in the U.S.
which is the largest wireless market in the world will drive growth in AFFO and dividends per share over the long term which we believe will provide shareholders with very attractive total returns.
With that operator I'm happy to open the call for questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Phil Cusick with J.P.
Morgan.
I guess I'll start with my traditional question which is what's driving the services strength? It was up even more in the fourth quarter.
Can that continue then into the first quarter and what are you thinking about the rest of the year? So we are forecasting 2015 to be essentially the same as 2014 which was a record year for us in terms of services margin I think about [70 million] [ph] or so.
What's driving that frankly is a lot of application volume and we are getting extremely good at capturing the addressable market that's occurring on our towers and that's everything from the front-end preconstruction work of permitting and zoning all the way through managing the construction of the installation or upgrade on a tower.
And so that take rate has been then steadily climbing over the years and we've gotten very good at capturing that opportunity and it's turned into a very nice business that it's application driven but for us it's opportunity.
Obviously we're making money at it and it's a great way to stay close to our customers and control most fundamentally what goes on our tower and what's happening at the tower site.
So we're very pleased with the business.
Okay.
And then second can you talk to me about the land portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter? It seemed like that was at a very high multiple.
How should we be thinking about that? Is that sort of fairly typical transaction and are there more of those to do this year? I don't think there's more to do and it was a little bit atypical.
It was a portfolio of sites that are a mixture of our sites and other sites and it had some that are more relatively short dated than we would have otherwise seen.
So when you price that you have to assume you price the rent growth over time as those expiries come up and so as a result the price is a little higher than it would have otherwise normally expected.
I don't see a lot more of those to come but in this case they were attractive assets and it made sense for us to pursue it.
Did you guys held up a little bit on that? I don't think so.
No that's not how I would characterize it.
Okay.
Thanks Ben.
We'll take our next question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Ben it was nice to see the organic revision higher.
It's still very early in the year you don't always do that.
Can you just talk about what you're seeing that gives you the confidence to move on that and I think you talked about expecting activity from all four players so perhaps you can just go through what's going on there? And related to that how should we think about AWS-3 at FirstNet are we going to get any revenues from that this year or how do you think about it for '16? Sure.
Simon we finished the fourth quarter very strong run rate-wise and so we carried that through to our guidance for '15.
We maintain a view that we're going to add about 100 million of organic revenue on the tower sites which is similar to where we were when we initiated guidance back in October.
So we haven't really changed our fundamental view of activity.
We think 2015 looks a lot like 2014.
We were pleased to finish strong in '14 and that's what we reflected in the guidance.
We have increased guidance a little bit because we are running ahead of plan on the small cell side and now I think we're at about 50 million of new revenue on that side.
So all in all we're very pleased with what we see for the year we're three weeks in so it's a little early but we're sticking with our guns here and it looks to us like a year that's shaping up to look like 2014 with a little bit of upside from the run rate beat on Q4.
On the AWS auctions I guess we take the view that obviously the auctions in terms of pricing have exceeded pretty much anybody's expectations approaching 45 billion today.
Our view is that that spectrum needs to get launched.
It will get launched and we could potentially see from activity late this year it won't be of any real significance financially this year and it will depend somewhat on the identity of the winning bidders which we'll all know here probably in the next couple of weeks so we are optimistic and any time there is a spectrum that's auctioned that's unsold inventory on the shelf for a carrier and they need to deploy it and we stand ready to help them with that.
And anything on FirstNet will the [Gazelle] [ph] get some of the funding from the auction obviously? They will get funded which is positive and we're staying very close to that situation.
I don't have anything to announce this morning on the call but it is positive certainly for them if they get their funding that was mandated out of the auction proceeds and look forward to getting some more clarity from them on how that network will proceed.
We'll take our next question from David Barden with Bank of America.
Two if I could.
Just the first one following up maybe Ben on the AWS-3 auction I guess because most of the carriers have an AWS spectrum deployment already they might not be hugely incrementals at all but AT&amp;T doesn't.
So do you see that AT&amp;T if we find out that AT&amp;T is one of the big winners here does that create incremental demand you think to the outlook that you have right now? And then the second question would be maybe for Jay I think in the release you talked about how the churn events that you're expecting from these acquired carriers are going to be lumpy but do you have any specific color that you've gotten from the carriers for instance in the turndowns in the first half that you could talk about and kind of how we would model that out? Sure Dave.
With respect to the AWS-3 launch over time we do expect that to be incremental as has been the case in the past that typically comes with equipment swap-outs and typically more and that would be characterized as an amendment and to the extent the carriers do that over time that would be positive to us.
I don't look at it really as incremental to our guidance implicitly.
The guidance back in October is a little more art than science sometimes and so implicitly we have some of these things baked in based on our experience over time and how these things roll out.
And in particular our best guess on how each individual of the four carriers impact that $100 million of add we probably best case get within 20% on any particular carrier's activity just because they don't know particularly what their allocations are and how things will go early in the year we typically get it pretty close but that's about as good as we can do back in October of the prior year.
But at least at this stage I don't look at it to be incremental to the $100 million of gross adds for the year.
On our assumption around non-renewals Dave we made an assumption obviously when we gave the outlook around the way it was going to come and it is a bit lumpy.
The way we laid out the outlook for 2015 front-end loaded the churn events over 2015 the most significant amount that we would expect for the full calendar year we currently believe will happen during the first quarter and as we look out over the course of the year I think you'll see our sequential revenue growth quarter to quarter actually accelerate and be a little bit higher.
So it's typically the case in the business that the year will be back-end loaded from an activity standpoint and we usually see that in terms of activity around leasing this year that that will also be the case as a result of our assumption around churn.
I don't really have any new updates to that from what we said last time.
The carriers have given us very specific feedback on what sites they would expect to take down and the timing of that.
So we've tried to reflect that in our outlook.
What we provided yesterday in the press release is very similar to what we provided in October.
So our assumptions are effectively unchanged from last time on both revenue growth as well as the non-renewals and then it is front-end loaded.
Right.
So the 1Q guidance includes the most significant churn event that you're going to have for the year and then it will kind of fade over the course of the year and we'll start to see that revenue acceleration quarter to quarter? That's true in terms of if you are accounting BBEs.
Obviously the impact of revenues you won't feel the impact as much in Q1 you'll start to feel it a little bit more in Q2 if those licenses are turned off during the course of Q1.
Got it.
Okay.
Thanks guys.
We'll take our next question from Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Couple of questions.
First can you talk a little bit about your leverage target? You guys I think were at 5.4x.
As you consider transactions that are out there Verizon have [indiscernible] today but Verizon Extranet what are you thinking about where your comfort is? You compared yourselves to the REITs obviously in the RMZ.
REITs carry a higher leverage than you guys do.
Some of your competitors maybe have the U.S.
levered more than the international.
Then the blended might look a little different considering you are a U.S.
focused company.
Help us understand a little bit about where you're comfortable with leverage.
Sure.
We've talked a long time about our target being 4x to 6x and have set a course towards trying to get to an investment-grade credit rating which we think has lots of positive implications for both the debt and the equity over time.
You've heard us talk about as we think about various assets and other things that for the right assets at the right price we may tend towards the higher end of that range of leverage and trying to be efficient and get the right returns for assets.
But I think typically you'll see us operate the business inside of that range and we tended towards the middle of that range we think it's about what it's going to take to get to an investment-grade credit rating.
So it's really going to be facts and circumstances decision that we'll make for the right asset.
You'll see us go above where we are today potentially but I think in normal course assuming the business is operating as it is now I can see us tend towards the middle of the range.
And then can you update us as far as kind of where your NOLs are at and there were some reports out there that the minority partner in Australia might be selling just trying to understand that process? Our NOLs today are at about right at about 2 billion.
On the minority partner Rick we're not involved in that process.
We're aware they may be exploring opportunities.
I guess we've seen a press note on that.
They've been in it since inception and have generated a lot of value for their company.
So they may be exploring options but we're not directly a party to that.
And when you consider would someday that be an asset you guys would consider setting as well and how would the NOLs in the U.S.
benefit the gains you would have on that nice sale if it were to occur? Sure.
I guess I got asked this question last time and covered it real quickly maybe a little better description as it warranted here.
We have done extremely well in Australia and we really have enjoyed our experience down there.
That business is about $100 million EBITDA business today and I think when we bought it it was $15 million.
So we've created an enormous amount of value and continue to serve our customers very well down there.
Going forward it's hard to argue while we enjoy the market dynamics there it's hard to argue as far away as it is that it's strategic I think is what I said last time.
And so to the extent there was someone who frankly wanted to own it for a value that compelled us to sell it we would take a look at it.
I don't know if there's one there we're not actively seeking or pursuing anything there but it is an interesting discussion driven by the tax situation as you partially noted.
That business will actually start to lose its tax shelter inherent in the depreciation over time.
So we will start paying more and more taxes over time which causes us to think about it.
The NOLs that we currently have would enable us to shelter essentially all of the gain if we were to divest that business and bring the proceeds back to the U.S.
So the NOL it would probably consume about half of the NOL or so with the gain.
So it's an interesting academic discussion there's nothing that we're pursuing today we've enjoyed and continue to enjoy our experience in that business and if something comes up in the future we'll let you know but as an academic discussion that's where we stand.
We'll take our next question from Jonathan Atkin from RBC.
So I have a question on the small cell business and just sort of the strategic outlook in terms of acquiring other operators and then in terms of your organic growth if you could give a little bit of color? You talked about the 6% to 8% returns going to low to mid-teens with additional tenancy and when you bring on additional tenants what types of additional buildout do you acquire because not everybody has the same outward [gas] [ph] needs so I was interested in kind of your experience to date on when a second tenant comes on do you need to outweigh more capital? And then finally when it comes to just expanding the plans are you at the right organizational capacity or would you consider adding either contractors or employees to further make investments in United States? Sure Jon I'll take the last couple of those.
As you add a second tenant we talked about our yields it's very similar to the tower model so you're adding additional yield you're adding across a fixed base of capital and operating expenses typically but the second tenant it's a little more complicated because inevitably maybe you had a 30 or 40 node system and that carrier coming on the second tenant may want most of that initial footprint that they may want additional laterals which requires them to invest additional capital for which we get capital reimbursement as well partially.
So there's always it's always a hybrid is what I should say it's not quite as clean as just a second tenant on a tower.
Nonetheless the yield that ultimately results from that with the second tenant clearly pushes us sort of into the teens area and above that.
Clearly you can understand how the economics work.
So… If I could briefly interrupt so is that yield on kind of a same asset basis or is it inclusive of this incremental capital? Inclusive yes inclusive total investment capital yes that's the way we would look at it.
And so it's definitely positive leverage as you go forward but it always involves a little more capital because you're building out additional laterals to fit a footprint requirement of that second carrier.
In terms of capacity we have ramped it up dramatically over 2013 and 2014.
We have in the pipeline the task in front of us in terms of a build activity that suggests we'll probably continue to ramp it a little bit more but not nearly the orders of magnitude we've done over the last 24 months.
And so I think you're going to actually be able to – we will see the sort of incremental margins coming out of that business that we've come to expect and enjoy in the tower business.
What we've done over the last few years frankly and I realize we don't segment report this for you so you'll just have to take my word for it what we've done in the last three years essentially is consume the growth in EBITDA a lot of it through G&amp;A expansion as we're adding capacity to get to a point where we can build 5 000 to 6 000 nodes a year which is where we are today and the pipeline of engagements continues to build.
We're getting better at it getting more efficient but we have put in a management structure that will enable us to meet customer needs at that order of scale and I think we're probably 80% down the road on where we're going to be on that.
So on your first question around acquiring other operators I would tell you we've done two meaningful acquisitions in this space over a long period of time.
NextG and NewPath were the two acquisitions that we've done.
And not only did we like the assets where the fiber was located as well as the existing nodes but we were thrilled with the platform that they brought the significant internal capabilities that both of those firms have and the talented folks that came with them and we viewed it as an opportunity for us to expand our small cell platform and give us an opportunity to continue to grow the business which has turned out to be everything that we expected and more and given us lot of opportunities to pursue more than we could have otherwise done if we had not been able to do those two acquisitions.
So I think those two have gone very well and as we look at our capabilities today I really don't see us pursuing another acquisition at the kind of multiples that we did with NextG and NewPath because we have a platform already.
And so if there was an opportunity for us I think it would look much more like a straight asset sale.
So you saw us in the fourth quarter one of the small acquisitions that we did was a small fiber company in the Northeast where we already had nodes under contract and we saw the opportunity to acquire fiber as a lower-cost alternative to building it ourselves.
So you may see us over time do some things like that where there are assets that make sense for us to own and we do a buy versus build analysis and that may make sense but in terms of looking externally for platforms and needing to do a more strategic thing there I don't think that's a likely outcome for us.
Thanks and then just a quick follow-up Title II broadband regulation and thoughts on how that would impact your business? Jon we've looked at that and I don't think there's a direct impact on our business.
There's a lot of discussion out there and some emotion involved and so we'll probably stay away from that question.
We're independent and we're a neutral host if you will and the shared infrastructure model works quite well and we don't really have a dog in that fight currently.
We'll take our next question from Michael Rollins of Citi.
Just curious as you look at the aspirations that you laid out for the five-year AFFO growth and then I think what you talked about the dividend is it a smooth line that investors should expect in terms of dividend growth or do you see it being accelerated on one part or the other of this sort of five-year horizon period and obviously you talked about in between some of the churn impacts just curious how that all relates to what investors should expect on a year-to-year dividend growth? Sure Michael I'll do my best.
As you can see from our guidance this year we're guiding up on AFFO per share of about 4.2% 4.3% so just a shave over 4% and again that's with about 700 basis points of churn headwind in that number.
And so if we are saying as we are that a compound annual growth rate we expect over five years to be 6% to 7% then obviously it has to be higher in the back four years of that.
And as Jay mentioned 2015 looks like our peak churn year in terms of headwind.
So with normal activity which I'm not giving you five-year guidance but we're giving you sort of a five-year target on what we think the cash flow growth is if activity sort of holds and the churn rolls off as we expect you'll see a pickup in that AFFO growth rate over time of a couple of hundred basis points in any given year.
It obviously has to get to sort of 7% to 8% at some point to get into that 6% to 7% area for the whole five years and that's our expectation.
We're just trying to keep it very simple for everyone so they can track back to their long-term modeling for us and appreciate that as you get out into the latter part of that five-year period you're coming off of bigger numbers.
So those percentage changes become ever more challenging off of a static asset base although we are growing the asset base particularly around small cells.
So we expect that the dividend growth will track that.
Our working assumption right now is that we will stay in and around sort of a 75% payout on an annual basis and so you'll see it grow kind of in that 6% to 7% CAGR over time obviously a little bit lighter on the front end probably and then more over time as it tracks AFFO growth.
We'll take our next question from Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
I noticed that the small cell CapEx was elevated in Q4.
Can you talk about how we should think about the seasonality for that and specific small cell CapEx how much of this is accelerated demand versus seasonality why don't we start with that? Kevin we did spend more obviously in the fourth quarter than we had in the other quarters and that's pretty typical in the business as people try to hit year-end targets.
So I expect as we talked about on the last quarterly call when we look at full-year 2015 we sized the dividend paying out about 75% of AFFO based on our expectation that about 25% of the AFFO will be invested in activities around the core business and the majority of that would be related to small cells.
So I think in terms of if you're looking for sequential quarter guidance we would expect that number to come off of what we spent in the fourth quarter and it will typically – our expectation would be it will typically ramp towards the back half of the year in any given year that would be a pretty typical investment cycle.
I would add but we are not capital constraining that business.
I mean as we see these attractive opportunities which we're continuing to pursue it is continuing to grow and we'll pursue them as they come in and that's we think fundamental to what we're doing and makes a lot of sense.
As that business goes from sort of a negative total free cash flow to positive I mean is there a chance that you can increase the payout ratio looking out two or three years? It's certainly contributing to AFFO growth and that's in our outlook but as I mentioned in my notes we're certainly ahead of plan over sort of a five-year period and I'm not going to forecast for you where we'll be in three years in the small cell business but it's certainly contributing to our growth over time and we expect that to continue.
And look if we're putting capital to work at high initial yields in the geographies that we're currently working where we have very high expectation that other carriers will co-locate on those systems over time then it will be accretive to growth and certainly will contribute to the dividend over time and that's our working assumption.
Can you give a little more granularity on CapEx trends by carrier? Verizon came in a little higher than they previously guided to on 2015 CapEx today we have yet to hear from Sprint or T-Mo but I think AT&amp;T caused a lot of concern in the industry but how much of that is really just AT&amp;T specifically and how much are you seeing in industry-wide slowdown? Kevin I'm not going to get into specifically speaking for the four carriers but I will say that we have reaffirmed our guidance today to add about $100 million on the core tower business as we did in 2014.
We see a very robust pipeline of activity.
As we sit here three weeks into the year we are looking at a very nice pipeline that gives us confidence to re-confirm you that number and that's made up of all four carriers doing various things on their network everything from brand new installations and new cell sites to significant augmentations and [justifications] [ph] and that's occurring really in varying levels across all the carriers.
The one thing I would say about AT&amp;T is there's been a lot of press about that and in any given year carriers increase and decrease their activity for a number of reasons and that's been the case forever and it doesn't happen on a straight line and over time we believe and it's certainly borne out in history that the carriers need to continue to invest in the network quality to support what we're all using as consumers and that we are the most efficient way for them to do that.
I mean the shared infrastructure model is alive and well it's very compelling for them to utilize our facilities versus try to build their own that's how our industry really has been founded and that is continuing today.
So we have a high level of confidence that you're going to continue to see that occur and the ebbs and flows in any particular carrier's budget year-to-year we don't get really too worked up about and I think the last thing I'll say to that is while there's I guess some consternation about the high value that the spectrum auction is attracting from our perspective it just sort of solidifies the long-term view of the value of these networks and the value that the carriers are obviously placing on delivering more broadband capability to all of us as consumers and the spectrum has to be matched with infrastructure in order to utilize and we stand ready to help.
We'll take our next question from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays.
Just tailing off on some of the prior questions on small cell it seems as though you folks are seeing much more constructive trends from not just Verizon but other carriers in the marketplace.
I was wondering if you could give a little bit of color in terms of the competitive landscape.
You folks have obviously made a diligent effort to invest in this market ahead of some of this growth that we've seen.
Do you anticipate sort of shifts in the competitive landscape or do you feel comfortable in terms of your positioning where this can be sort of a leading driver for you folks and perhaps sort of increasing your share going forward? Amir what I'd say is it's a big world out there with a lot of geographies that the carriers are either currently or I believe in the future will identify that they need to employ small cell architecture to add capacity and we are only scratching the surface and we are going about as fast as we can possibly go to tell you the truth.
From our guys listening on the call they would agree.
We're going to continue to ramp that capability but I would tell you it's a competitive market and we expect we will continue to have competitors and probably more competitors over time but the geographic footprint that we secure and build has the same dynamics and sort of natural barriers to entry as a tower.
Once you've got the embedded capital there it's very efficient to add that second or third tenant over time.
And so the model we think is very analogous to what we see on the tower side and we are seeing more carriers in varying levels of interest and budget capacities become increasingly interested in what we have to offer and I don't have a huge announcement for you today on the number of new activities we have with other carriers.
As we said in our comments the overwhelming majority of what we're seeing right now is with Verizon.
In geographies that if I were to share everybody on the call maps of where they're going I think we'd have almost unanimous agreement that these locations make sense in terms of adding capacity in urban areas and a very high likelihood that the other carriers will come on those systems for the very same reason that Verizon has identified it initially.
So we're very comfortable with where we are it is a competitive environment but a lot of it comes down to execution it is a more challenging undertaking than just leasing a tower and we have the capability and we've frankly invested in the capability and the people to get us there.
And then with that if we are looking at sort of you mentioned your sort of increasing budget or allocation of budget given sort of the thought process around CapEx budget is it coming from macro cell investments and being relocated to the small cell site or are you seeing this as sort of incremental dollars relative to your sort of macro site investments that you were seeding? We're seeing it completely incremental.
I mean as I mentioned Verizon being the majority of our first tenant adds in the new systems that we're building I wouldn't begin to suggest we've seen any slowdown from Verizon on macro sites.
In fact they've been very very active.
So I think it's incremental it's adding capacity in these networks that are going to be needed for everything we are all doing on the systems today and more in the future and it's just a different way and an efficient way where a macro cell site really won't suffice or is not available to add that capacity.
Great.
Thank you very much for that color.
We'll take our next question from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
You mentioned $5 million of AFFO coming from the M&amp;A you did in the fourth quarter.
Is that a fully burdened number so assuming some form of debt financing associated with the M&amp;A which you did arguably interest being interest expense tied to that is that $5 million net of that number? And then the second question I was wondering if you could just give us an update on what your expectations are for CapEx for 2015? On the first question Colby it is a burdened number.
We drew under the revolver to pay for the assets.
So there's about $7 million to $8 million of interest expense associated with the acquisition.
So that $5 million of AFFO was after that.
On your second question we've sized CapEx assuming that we're going to spend about 25% of AFFO on CapEx in calendar year 2015.
Obviously we do have some benefit of the prepaid rent when the carriers go on sites and deliver to us prepaid rent which covers a portion a large portion of the CapEx that we spend to improve the site in order to hold the next tenant.
So there's a bit of an offset that we get there from a cash standpoint but broadly in terms of CapEx net CapEx to us or net cash out the door we're sizing that right at about 25% of our AFFO for 2015.
And does that then so M&amp;A would be outside of that number there? M&amp;A would be outside of that number.
We'll take our next question from Mike McCormack with Jefferies.
Maybe Jay just a comment on the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile tower outsized rental growth and just trying to get a sense for what your view is the longevity of that outsized growth versus the traditional core? And then secondly thinking about carrier health we've got one of your and your peer's biggest customers that burns a tremendous amount of cash just trying to get a sense for how you guys sort of risk adjust that.
I know you've got protections in place to some degree.
I'm just wondering how you think about them.
On your first question Mike the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile portfolios have done very well since we acquired them.
You could see from my comments if you look at the leasing on a percentage basis about 50% higher than the legacy assets.
So those assets have done exactly what we expected in terms of enhancing our growth rates and we've been pleased with how they've performed out of the gate.
Our underwriting assumptions as we looked at the assets was we believe that we are entering a cycle both in terms of spectrum auctions as well as the activity from the carriers and technology migrations et cetera they were going to be focused on deploying a lot of new cell sites and increasing cell site density.
So it's certainly our expectation in 2015 that will continue and frankly as we think about a longer period of time I think it's very likely that those two assets and their revenue growth will outpace that of our legacy towers.
As we talked about it on a percentage basis obviously the benefit there on a percentage basis as they are coming off of a much lower base so when you get down to nominal dollars per tower the differences would be smaller but on a percentage basis those assets that we acquired with low amounts of revenue and cash flow have a meaningful impact to our expected growth rate.
Mike on your other question just thinking about the competitive landscape of the four carriers I guess I keep going back to what's been true really since the last 15 years is that every time we look at our carrier landscape there's always somebody on the outside looking to get in.
And then on this call I think there was a question about FirstNet which has certainly a stated need to launch a national public safety network and it's yet to be determined how that's going to occur.
[Indiscernible] We've talked about it you've got a rumor out this morning and an article in a journal on the Google MVNO.
I think all of that speaks to and then DISH with their spectrum and unclear yet exactly how that's ultimately going to get launched so they can get a wireless product but ultimately there's a consumer demand of over 300 million people with multiple devices continuing to load these networks.
The note I mentioned earlier was smartphone utilization has basically in terms of capacity doubled in the last year that's just incredible.
And so what's happening is the networks and regardless almost of who owns the networks are becoming more and more utilized and that takes capital and there's other sources of outside capital that stand out there potentially ready to invest to get a share of that access to the wireless consumer Google being the most recent description of that.
So over time we're very comfortable that the business that we're in which is providing shared infrastructure in a very efficient way more efficient than owning these assets on their balance sheet is the way to go and the competitive landscape will sort itself out over time but my perspective is the pie is only growing and attracting additional capital and that's good for us.
We'll take our next question from Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.
I want to go back to some comments you made a little bit earlier on the call about in a potential Title II world I think you paraphrased sounded like you did not think that that was going to be that impactful.
However the CFO of Verizon today was saying that while Title II if that were enacted would not impact their 2015 CapEx it definitely would have negative ramifications on 2016.
So I'm assuming that they're also including in that wireless assets the potential will be classified under Title II.
So can you help us think through that or do you know something that we don't know that you do not perhaps do not think that wireless will come under any type of Title II regulation? Michael I've actually spoken with all four carriers about this and there are varying levels of views about the potential outcome on this and what it means for capital spending and their long-term plans for network and investment and economics around that.
So I'm really not going to get into speaking for them on this.
There are a variety of views it's highly charged as you can imagine as you see comments out there and from our perspective the business that we're in is pretty agnostic.
There will be ultimately demand on these networks.
Certainly they're talking about forbearance on pricing over time.
We'll see where that goes.
We don't spend a whole lot of time worrying about it and obviously that's something the carriers have varying lobbying efforts underway on that and we do pay attention to it but don't find that it directly affects our business at this point.
Have you handicapped – and that's fair obviously but have you handicapped any downside or upside versus kind of status quo if it goes either way as far as a revenue impact? No I haven't.
I mean I could go back and we could talk about the spectrum auctions but that spectrum is going to get put in the hands of carriers they're going to utilize it and that will I think that creates a runway that's we think far in excess of probably any potential negative that could come out of potentially Title II regulation on net neutrality.
I mean there's a long way to go on that discussion but to the extent the spectrum auction clears at these prices which it certainly looks like it's going to that spectrum is going to get launched and it takes infrastructure to launch that spectrum and that's about as far as we have to think through that right now.
One of the things that I would just highlight for you and we've talked about it a lot as we talk to investors it's how we think about the business when we talk about total long-term returns to shareholders of about 10% to 11% about 70% of that today or two-thirds of it roughly is either in the form of a current dividend or embedded in our contracted escalators.
So the one-third of the balance of the return that we're certainly chasing and working hard at and we've obviously laid out our forecast for the next 12 months and talked a lot about leasing but as we get into questions like this around what could the downside be what could the upside be we're talking about one-third of the total return and so if you wanted to take a haircut to it you're welcome to do that but it's relatively muted on an overall total returns to the shareholders and I think that's in part why we made the decision last quarter to meaningfully increase the dividend and we think the story is pretty compelling in virtually any kind of environment.
And then just one last thing with regard to the potential reseller agreement between or contemplated agreement between Google T-Mo and Sprint can you see any scenario where that would be negative for the towers I mean just the industry itself I mean I don't really see it being negative but I would appreciate your thoughts? I can see no scenario where it would be negative.
MVNOs we've had them for a long time in the industry they add capacity to a network and utilization and that ultimately takes additional sites and to the extent that came with additional revenue stream or capital infusion in the host carrier that would obviously be helpful for their continued investment in the network.
So I can see no negative downside from that and it frankly just reinforces what we were saying earlier that there seems to be always people on the outside looking to get access to wireless subscribers and that's good for us fundamentally.
All right thanks.
Good to know you didn't have any Google revenue in your outlook.
We'll take our next question from Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.
Just want to follow up on a comment that Ben made earlier.
I completely agree that you look really attractive relative to the RMZ index or other dividend and yield oriented stocks.
Are there any indices that you think you can eventually be included in? I think one of the hesitations for investors would be going out of benchmark.
So inclusion in an index could be a positive catalyst for your equity.
I'll take that.
We obviously think that the business as we've talked about for a long period of time we're a real estate business and our hope would be that over time the various indexes that look at real estate will treat us and include us like they do other traditional real estate products.
So I don't necessarily have any update to that other than we continue to have conversations and we hope that over time the tower industry is embraced as another very stable form of real estate and think there are lots of characteristics of our business that would support that.
And that's happened over time.
About 50% of the market cap of REITs today are what you would consider non-traditional REITs and most of them have made it into the indices over time and so we'll see how that goes over time.
I think from our perspective there is a much broader – while we're very pleased to participate and be evaluated against the real estate companies I think that's a relevant benchmark.
There's a much broader universe out there of income investors that I think are attracted to our Company and our story based on the predictable long-term returns that we've talked about.
As Jay mentioned two-thirds of our total return expectation is on the books when we show up in the morning.
That's a very unique scenario.
You don't find that very often.
We spend all day long working on that last third and that's what we're pursuing every day but it's pretty compelling in the sort of low-return and volatile environment we area today where you've got a 4% dividend yield and upwards of 4% contracted in terms of cash flow growth and we like that model and it's why we've done what we've done to put us in that position and we think over time it attracts the lowest cost of capital which enables us to frankly continue to pursue this business model which at its core is all about sharing and I think it's important to go back through just real quickly when we talk about return on invested capital that comes from sharing these assets and as we talked about on this call our legacy sites with 15% return on invested capital typically those towers have three tenants per tower so they are all paying about 5% a year to occupy the asset and that's fundamental to this business and why it's compelling for the carriers to utilize this why it's been compelling for them to sell and lease back the sites to us and we think a very efficient model really for the long-term and why we're so bullish.
We'll take our next question from Batya Levi with UBS.
A couple of follow-ups.
One can you provide the split on the new leases and amendments that you're seeing I think it was about 75-25 in the last quarter and how you expect that to trend into '15? And another question on the small cell business of the 50 million incremental growth that you expect for this year can you give us a sense on what percent is on the recurring long-term contracts versus maybe one-time projects that you have planned? On your first question similar to what we saw in 2014 we're expecting new leases to make up approximately 70% of that activity and 30% to the amendments.
So if you looked at fourth quarter [indiscernible] outlook it would be in that 70-30 mix.
If I understand your question correctly on the 50 million of incremental all of that is long term all of that is long-term contracted revenue.
So as we speak about that we're talking about site rental revenue and the contracts that we signed for small cells are very similar to that of the tower sites.
So they are generally speaking 10 to 15 years of initial terms with embedded escalations.
There is some component of services in small cells but it's really pretty small.
So as we think about that number we're talking about the long term recurring numbers that flow through AFFO.
We'll take our next question from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI.
Thanks for fitting me in here.
Two questions if I may.
First I noticed that there was a small change in expected churn for the year.
I think you took it down by 10 bps.
Is that just a rounding error or is there something a push-out or some conversations around churn that are a little different than they were maybe a quarter ago when you put out initial guidance? And then my second question just has to do with the organic site rental revenue growth by portfolio.
As I look at the legacy U.S.
assets the T-Mobile assets that you've laid out here I was under the impression that T-Mobile assets had maybe 50% maybe a little bit higher than that tenancy versus sort of the legacy assets and so in terms of sort of incremental tenancy across those two bases 4% on the legacy would imply slightly higher incremental tenancy versus the T-Mobile assets I'm just wondering if there are some other factors I should be considering when I look at that? Yes Jonathan the list to dial in this morning was long so quite happy to take the question.
On your first question around churn if you look at both the escalator provision the amount from escalations on a percentage basis as well as the churn those ticked down I think just like 10 basis points and that's because the organic site rental leasing in the fourth quarter was higher than expected so it's coming off than a higher base which causes the percent to be lower but on nominal dollars our assumption is unchanged.
So that's just the way the percentages fall.
On your second question the T-Mobile assets had about 1.7 tenants on them at acquisition and the legacy towers at the time we did the transaction would've been in the high 2s or two 3s.
So there's a lot higher leasing existing on the legacy assets than there were on the T-Mobile assets.
And so as we're adding additional tenants obviously the percentage growth is going to be higher on those T-Mobile assets and we're finding a similar thing on the AT&amp;T assets.
So there's nothing I think you're looking for something maybe in the numbers there that may be a little different and it's not it's just coming off of a lower base.
And then to Batya's question around leasing components we are seeing about 70% of the activity being driven by new leases and the result of that is that the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile portfolios do very well and that drives the higher percent growth rate.
Great.
So the incremental tenancy sort of across the basis in terms of demand and everything is looking pretty consistent? Very consistent.
All right.
Thank you for taking the questions.
We have time for one more question.
We'll take our final question from Ana Goshko with Bank of America.
So quickly two related questions just on what the [indiscernible] is for the revolver upsize and also with regards to a discretionary spending potentially in acquisition so as you pointed out in the fourth quarter because of the land purchases largely you had to draw on revolver just on the discretionary spending and the dividend and if we look at the AFFO for this coming year it's really earmarked for the dividend and for the CapEx projects so wondering does the 600 million upsizing revolver kind of implied that you are likely going to draw on it over the course of the year to continue to fund acquisitions? I would say we've used over time we've used the revolver as a bridge of sorts if there are acquisitions that we tuck in.
So we think it's just good corporate governance and good financial discipline to have it there because it's an opportunity when there's the right asset available for us to use that revolver to draw down and buy assets.
So you may see us do that over time but everything that we do in terms of if you think about small cells or tuck-in acquisitions for towers or ground leases all of those have to go through the filter of us believing that they are enhancing to the growth rate and to the dividend over time and if it doesn't meet that criteria then obviously we're not interested in doing acquisition.
So to the extent that there are opportunities and acquisitions that are out there that revolver becomes helpful in the process of us going through that but I wouldn't necessarily point you to assume that we're going to draw into that revolver or even use it.
As we sit here today there aren't any acquisitions that I would expect us to be funding in the coming quarters.
So it's opportunistic and it's based upon the returns.
Otherwise what we see in front of us as opportunities that we're likely to invest in is really limited to about 25% of AFFO as I spoke to earlier in the call.
And to the extent in size you would pay it you would term it out over time would be our practice typically.
Right.
And then because you do run with a pretty lean cash balance I mean do you target a minimum availability under the revolver? Yes we did think about it that way and typically we won't let it get below about $250 million to $350 million at any given time.
Obviously today we have about $1.4 billion of capacity so we're well above that.
Given the nature of the business though everybody pays rent as of the first of the month and that's the driver of all of the cash flow.
So we don't have some of the working capital challenges that a lot of businesses have.
Okay great.
Thanks for the clarification.
I think we got to wrap up.
I appreciate everybody staying with us an hour and 15 minutes this morning.
We had a long list of questions.
Again I want to express my appreciation to the team at Crown Castle for a terrific 2014.
We got a lot accomplished more than one thing at a time is what we talk about now we can do more than one thing at a time very well and we have a terrific outlook for '15.
So we're going to get to work and I appreciate everybody's interest and we'll talk to you next quarter.
And this does conclude today's conference call.
Thank you all for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Good day and welcome to the Crown Castle International Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call.

Thanks Son and good morning everyone.
We started 2015 with a great first quarter.
The US wireless carriers continue to make investments to upgrade their networks to keep pace with increasing consumer wireless demand.
And we expect to see strong leasing activity throughout 2015.
Turning to the first-quarter results on slide three site rental revenue grew 3% year-over-year from $747 million to $768 million.
Organic site rental revenue grew 5% year-over-year comprised of approximately 3% growth from cash escalations in our tenant lease contracts and approximately 6% growth from new leasing activity net of approximately 4% from non-renewals.
Moving to slide four adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the high-end of our previously provided first quarter 2015 outlook.
As mentioned in our earnings release yesterday the outperformance during the quarter includes the timing of two items that impact first quarter 2015 results as well as our second quarter 2015 outlook.
First network services gross margin contribution was higher than our expectations for the quarter by approximately $9 million due to network services activity that was previously expected to occur during the second quarter taking place during the first quarter.
Second sustaining capital expenditures during the first quarter was lower than expected by approximately $6 million.
This expected $6 million in sustaining capital expenditure is expected to be invested during the remainder of 2015.
Ignoring the benefit from the timing of these two items adjusted EBITDA and AFFO for the first quarter would be at or higher than the midpoint of our previously provided outlook for the first quarter.
Turning to investment activities as shown on slide five during the first quarter we invested $205 million in capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $17 million in sustaining capital expenditures and $24 million in land purchases.
During the first quarter we completed over 500 land transactions of which 20% were purchases with the remainder being lease extensions.
For the full year 2015 we are targeting completing over 2000 land transactions.
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business and as we look to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time.
Today approximately one-third of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own and approximately 70% on land we own or lease for more than 20 years.
This number increases to 90% when we include ground leaser of 10 years or more.
Where we have ground leases the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years.
More detailed information regarding the ground interest beneath our towers is available in our supplemental information package on our website.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we invested $164 million in revenue generating capital expenditures consisting of $96 million on existing sites and $68 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell construction activity.
We continue to see significant growth in site rental revenues from small cells which grew in excess of 35% year-over-year.
Today small cells represent 7% of our site rental revenue and site rental gross margin.
Small cells offer a shareable model similar to towers that provides wireless carriers with a solution to address network capacity constraints where a macro tower site is not available or is insufficient.
Our investment in small cell anchored builds typically generates 6% to 8% initial yield and gross margins of 60 to 70%.
With the colocation of the second tenant on the initial fibre investment we typically see incremental margins of 80% to 90% bringing IRRs above the 20% level.
We believe investing in small cell builds on our core confidence -- builds on our core competency as the leading provider of US wireless infrastructure leveraging our existing relationships with the wireless carriers.
Like towers tenant leases on small cells are typically long-term with 10 to 15 year committed term with annual escalators.
Given what we are seeing from the wireless carriers and their public commentary we believe we are in the very early stages of small cell adoption and deployment.
Similar to towers built in the late 1990s and early 2000s we are focused on building small cell networks in the most attractive locations in the US in places like Manhattan Washington DC Southern California and Chicago.
As mobile data demand grows the necessity of small cells increase as evidenced by our growing pipeline of over 2500 anchor builds and colocations on existing systems which have been awarded to us but are not yet in construction.
Today inclusive of our acquisition of NextG in 2012 we have invested approximately $1.7 billion in small cells.
Our current yield on investment is 7% inclusive of our $1 billion investment in NextG at an initial yield of approximately 4%.
With our leadership position of over 14 000 nodes on air or under construction and 7000 miles of fibre we are winning new opportunities and driving yields up on our existing investments in small cell networks.
Shifting to financing activities during the quarter we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per share or $274 million in aggregate.
As of March 31 our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.3 times.
We continue to maintain a target leverage ratio of five times as we remain focused on achieving an investment-grade credit rating.
Our weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.1% with a weighted average maturity of six years.
We believe overtime our disciplined approach to leverage and capital allocation including our dividend policy will lower our cost of capital.
A core strategy of the company is to reduce our cost of capital and thereby increase the value to shareholders of our large and growing annuity like business.
Turning to the second quarter outlook on slide six on a sequential basis the second-quarter 2015 outlook for site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO are expected to be impacted by certain seasonal or timing items.
Repair and maintenance during the second quarter of 2015 is expected to be higher by approximately $4 million as compared to the first quarter reflecting the seasonal nature of certain activities consistent with prior years as the weather warms.
As mentioned in the press release the expected sequential movements in our outlook for network services gross margin and sustaining capital expenditures are attributable to timing as expectations for network services gross margin as well as sustaining capital expenditures remain substantially unchanged from the previously provided full year 2015 outlook.
Moving on to the full-year 2015 outlook on slide seven we have increased the midpoint for our full-year 2015 outlook for site rental revenue by $7 million and AFFO by $3 million.
The increased outlook reflects the strong results from the first quarter and includes the negative impact from a decrease in foreign exchange rate assumptions related to our Australia business which is expected to impact site rental revenues and AFFO by approximately $8 million and $6 million respectively.
Given the underlying favourable fundamentals which Ben will speak to in a moment we remain confident in our ability to generate annual AFFO growth of 6% to 7% organically over the next five years with cash escalations on our tenant leases contributing to half of the expected growth.
We believe this growth combined with returning significant capital to shareholders through dividends provide shareholders with compelling long-term total returns.
And with that I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us today on the call.
As Jay mentioned in his remarks we are focused on providing shareholders with an attractive total long-term return proposition.
We measure long-term total returns as dividend yield plus growth in AFFO per share.
I'd like to take a moment to explain the composition of the total return profile we offer to shareholders.
Turning to slide eight based on yesterday's closing stock price we expect to deliver on average long-term total returns of approximately 10% to 11% per year.
This 10% to 11% total returns is comprised of approximately 4% from our current dividend yield plus 6% to 7% from our expectation of growing AFFO per share organically.
While the dividend yield ultimately will be determined by the market we believe our business model given its growth and quality compares very favourably to some of the best in class REITs who have dividend yields of approximately 3%.
Turning to our expected growth of the 6% to 7% annual growth in AFFO organically about half of this growth comes from our existing book of business via the cash escalations and our tenant lease contracts.
For some context we currently have approximately $22 billion of high-quality future revenues under long-term contract primarily with the four largest US wireless carriers.
The remaining 50% of expected AFFO growth comes from new leasing activity.
This activity is driven by carrier network investments as the carriers deploy more equipment to add capacity and coverage either in the form of new tenant colocation on our sites or amendments to existing locations.
As has been true since the early days of the wireless industry network quality continues to be the market differentiator for carrier success.
Today the industry is seeing unprecedented data growth on new LTE networks supported by more robust devices and applications.
As a result growing consumer demand and usage is leading to an inevitable need for carrier network investments.
As can be seen on slides nine and 10 there is a strong relationship between consumer usage unit economics and carrier capital investments.
With strong unit economics of approximately $50 per subscriber per month or $600 annually US carriers are able to generate positive incremental returns on their incremental capital investment.
The relatively high ARPU is supported by the staggering amount of mobile data consumption by US subscribers.
As we look to the future demand for mobile data is seemingly limitless.
Cisco's latest report confirms this view projecting that US mobile data traffic will increase seven-fold between 2014 and 2019 after accounting for Wi-Fi offloading.
There are many factors contributing to this insatiable demand for mobile data.
However a couple of things jump out to me including innovation around devices and applications and user demographics.
First there is an immense amount of innovation taking place around mobile devices and applications.
Businesses and consumers are reinventing the way we live and do business taking advantage of the convenience and accessibility that mobile data provides.
For example there is increasing adoption of Internet TV or over-the-top content offerings.
Today we can stream video on demand on a safer network with applications such as YouTube Netflix and Hulu just to name a few.
Applications such as these drove mobile video data growth of 60% in 2014.
And by 2019 mobile data traffic from video is expected to be nine times higher than current levels.
Video enriched content represents an exciting revenue opportunity for wireless carriers and promises to propel the next wave of network investment.
Machine to machine or M2M connections including wearable devices is another example of an area of innovation that is expected to drive significant growth in data usage.
Today there is on average 1.2 connected devices per US wireless consumer.
Amazingly by 2019 that's estimated to be up to 3.2 connected devices for US wireless consumers.
Examples of M2M connections include home security and automation smart metering and utilities and connecting cars.
Mobile data traffic generated from M2M connections is expected to double each year between now and 2019.
Turning to demographics consumer profiles play a significant part in mobile data usage.
Applications such as text and email are widely embraced equally across all age groups.
However social networking video viewing and music streaming are skewed towards younger subscribers which over time will become a larger percentage of the overall subscriber base.
Subscribers in the age range of 18 to 29 stream video and music at 2 to 3 times the rate of subscribers 30 years old and above.
The upcoming change in demographics alone will likely lead to significant increased mobile data demand.
Based on the expected growth in US data growth we have intentionally been expanding our portfolio of wireless infrastructure in the US by investing in the AT&amp;T mobile tower transactions adding over 17 000 towers and making significant investments in small cell networks over the past few years.
As nearly three quarters of our sites are located in the top 100 markets we have a tremendous opportunity to capture incremental leasing from increasing cell site density necessary to keep up with demand.
Further we have ample capacity and opportunity to accommodate additional carriers on these sites.
Towers continue to be the most efficient and cost-effective way for carriers to add network capacity and coverage and support our bullish long-term view on site leasing.
As Jay has already mentioned we are also very excited by the small cell opportunity.
It's an opportunity for us to extend our leadership position in shared wireless infrastructure.
With initial yields of 6% to 8% which is higher than a typical tower acquisition yield and the same underlying shareable model that leads to IRRs above 20% with the second tenant added it clearly meets our return thresholds.
We believe small cells is a great investment and we are at the very early stages of this opportunity.
Three years ago when we acquired NextG Networks the then leader in the field of small cells or distributed antenna system deployment we had a thesis that this architecture of fibre-fed deployment will play an important role in adding capacity to networks of the future as carriers seek to monetize the data opportunity.
Today our investment thesis has been validated beyond our expectations as we examine the large and growing pipeline of system developments or deployments upon which we are engaged it’s apparent this is not a niche technology.
Rather it promises to be the solution to add capacity in virtually every urban and suburban geography in the US.
Just like towers some of the best assets will be those that were secured early where co-location upgrades and expansion is virtually assured.
So in summary we are pleased with the start of the year and very excited about the long-term trends that promise to bring more opportunity for Crown Castle to assist our customers in realizing their objectives.
In so doing we believe our capabilities and portfolio of assets will continue to provide an attractive investment for shareholders and a great place to work for employees.
And with that operator I’d be pleased to turn the call over for questions.
Thank you.
[Operator Instructions] And we’ll go ahead and take our first question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Great.
Thanks very much.
Good morning.
Ben can you just talk a little bit about carrier activity through the year.
We saw some very low CapEx from AT&amp;T and Verizon this first quarter.
Were you seeing any impact from people waiting to see what they ended up within the AWS auctions and is there a sort of a sense that activities picking up through the year and then for Jay you mentioned your investment grade target you're getting pretty close now to that five times what do you think the path and the timing is here to actually close the deal on that? Thanks.
Sure Simon.
Thanks for the question.
As we look at carrier activity it's shaping up pretty much like we thought for the year.
I think on the Verizon call they intimated a little bit back-end loaded on CapEx spending reconfirming their guidance for the whole year.
That's probably what we are seeing little back-end loaded but that's consistent with how we originally forecasted guidance and to just sort of think about how various carriers ebb and flow with their network enhancements and their capital spending we've gotten to the point where we don't get really that worked up about individual carriers and individual quarters of how it shapes up.
It's gotten fairly consistent across the years and sort of the inevitability of the need for cell site density and more upgrades on existing sites.
We are seeing each of the carriers work on increasing network quality in their own way and they talk about it publicly and obviously with us and that's what we work on every day.
So I'd say it's shaping up about like we thought and perhaps a little bit back-end loaded.
On your second questions I'm not really able to provide you with a path or a timing necessarily on when we will get there but what I can tell you is we've had a number of conversations with each of the rating agencies and have been engaged in an ongoing dialog on the subject for the last -- over a year around achieving the investment grade credit rating.
And as you point out rightly point out as we are nearing the leverage target the vast majority of our credit metrics are if not within very close to meeting their published criteria for achieving an investment-grade credit rating.
So we’re optimistic and pleased with where we've gotten to in the approach that the agencies have taken towards upgrading the credit over the last 18 months to two years and we think we’re on the right path just don't know the exact timing of that.
Great.
Thank you.
Sure.
And we will take our next question from David Barden with Bank of America.
Hey guys.
Thanks.
Thanks for the details on the small cell business 7% of revenue I think this is the first time that you may have shared it.
It’s also 7% of the site rental margin as well which suggests that even at this stage of development the small-cell business is generating margins that are equivalent with the totality of the business and I guess that’s a little surprising given that these are mostly presumably one tenant businesses thus far and they could advance from here could you kind of elaborate a little bit on the kind of cost structure and margin opportunity that's developing in the small-cell business? Thanks.
Sure David.
That speaks to the initial yield differential between a typical tower you would acquire or a small cell system you might build.
As we mentioned across our entire cumulative investment we're at 7% today which is pretty staggering given that 1 billion of that came at 4% three years ago as we remember with NextG.
So obviously that incremental 700 million had to do pretty well.
And obviously we’ve grown NextG appropriately as we would have forecasted.
So it reflects that initial higher yield on invested capital and then the very high incremental margins from colocation and we are staying colocation and on a significant number of the original NextG systems where we are adding to that existing plant as well as additional laterals off of it.
So from a financial perspective we are extremely comfortable with what we see going forward.
I guess maybe to broaden your question a little bit the challenges are around deployment.
We are extremely busy as Jay mentioned about our backlog we've got a lot going on we've added a lot of people to that business it's not all capitalized so we've got overhead dragging that business a little bit but we’re thrilled with what we see in terms of the opportunity and more and more as we really dig into the engagements that we’re getting and you look at the geographies.
You come to the conclusion as I mentioned in my notes it's not a niche product it's not and it's somewhat random actually you're saying capacity needs in so many urban and suburban areas that you can quickly start to figure out that we're talking about a universe here I think of hundreds of thousands of nodes over time.
Obviously we will never be able to accomplish all of that ourselves there will be many other people in this market but the size of the opportunity honestly reminds us a little bit of that’s where the the early days of towers and we are going about as fast as we possibly can.
Thanks Ben.
And Jay if I could follow up with one question just on the churn side it looks like you trimmed a little bit the expectation for non-renewals in this year is that on the Sprint-Nextel side or is that on the other kind of acquired carrier side and how do you kind of see the moving parts now moving for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Yeah Dave.
We really don't see much of a change from our previous expectations around churn so for the full year we basically expect to see about the same amount of churn as we did previously maybe a little bit of it has been pushed out further in the year.
So on a percentage basis it’s moved a little bit but there is nothing underlying that tenth of a basis point there that we saw moving the numbers no real change in our expectation or actual activity to any meaningful amount.
Okay great.
Thanks guys.
And we will go to our next question with Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Hey guys thanks.
Talking about the services side it seems like the services slowdown pretty highly correlates to the T Verizon probably Sprint lower CapEx.
Would you anticipate a pretty quick rebound here as carriers ramp CapEx in the second half? Yeah Phil we made the comments around the timing from first quarter to second quarter and it is obviously challenging for us in the business to necessarily know exactly how things are going to fall out in the year.
The services business because all of the work that we're doing is related to work that’s done on our sites we have pretty good visibility to the balance of the year around leasing activity.
And so as we went into the year and as evidenced by the fact that we increased the outlook about $15 million on an FX neutral basis for site rental revenue from a leasing standpoint the year is shaping up to be maybe slightly better than what we had originally expected.
And so our services assumption follows that that services for the full year are about what we had previously expected.
So I wouldn't get too tied up in sequential quarter to quarter move.
It has to do with how the carriers allocate their capital and when they spend it.
But for the full year activity looks like it's going to be about the same as what it was in 2014 and so our services business is basically not just that.
Okay.
And then as I think about Simon mentioned the leverage getting down toward five times with the stock trading where it is why not be looking into to buy some of that back? Are you working on trying to get the rating agencies through before you look at that or should we look at that as being a more near-term possibility? Well it's always a possibility and you know we are not shy about buying stock but as you can tell from our results we're spending pretty much all our free cash flow and a little bit more on what we think are incredibly attractive investment opportunities as we’ve outlined on this call it’s small cells primarily.
And so I look for that to continue I don't see a huge amount of free cash flow availability to buy stock for the near-term.
And I do think that certainly as we’ve outlined one of our core strategic objectives is to secure the investment-grade rating which I think completely sort of maximizes the monetization of the dividend power of this business and then insulates the balance sheet going forward to a decree on just the overall cost to debt long-term.
So it's something we are going to focus pretty carefully on.
And I think we are on the path to that hopefully sooner than later.
I think over the longer term as you have seen us do for a long period of time once we get to the targeted level of leverage so about five times once we're down there at that level that will produce borrowing capacity if we're growing EBITDA in and around just for instance $100 million a year that's creating about $500 million of investment capacity once we get down to that target level of leverage.
So on the short-term I think you're going to see us focus as Ben mentioned on getting down to the five times level.
And then once we are down there then we create additional capacity for investment and absolutely stock purchases that are the benchmark against which we compare all the investments that we make in the business.
Okay.
Thanks Jay.
And we will go to our next question with Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.
Thanks for taking the question.
I was hoping you can maybe give us an update on the process involving the Australian segment and then if you do determine to close the transaction how do you think about prioritizing the cash.
And could you just remind us how you may be able to utilize the NOLs? Sure Brett.
As we've mentioned before and put out a press release we are engaged in a process to evaluate the sale of our Australian business.
I don't have anything to announce this morning other than to say that that is ongoing and we have a number of very highly qualified folks that we are speaking with about that.
And so I don't want to predict the outcome there for you because it's certainly not complete.
If we were to elect and pursue a transaction there and complete a sale I think we would first approach it from a leverage neutral proposition as we talked about just a moment ago on Phil’s question.
So in and around $500 million of proportional debt reduction is sort of required for that.
But that would still leave a significant amount of proceeds available that then we would have for investment opportunity.
And just like with any proceeds or capacity we have we would look to do what maximizes sort of long-term AFFO per share that could include buying stock it could include buying other assets continuing to invest around the core business.
So all of that is on the table and we will seek to maximize the outcome of those proceeds.
And finally to your last point Brett on the tax position we have the benefit of the NOLs so there won't be any taxes paid at the corporate level.
We also believe that as a REIT we will generate a significant capital gain inside the REIT that will then get passed out to shareholders in the form of the next amount of dividend that we pay will be in fact capital gain treatment.
So to the extent we were paying in and around $1.1 billion of dividends on an annual basis that capital gain would go out at a lower tax rate than the ordinary income tax rate that the normal quarterly dividend receives.
Then to the extent the reminder doesn’t in fact cover all the income within the REIT that's where we could actually use the NOL to make up that gap.
So the shorter answer is there is no tax paid at the corporate level and at the shareholder level to the extent of the gain it would be a capital-gains treatment is our best estimate today versus ordinary income.
So we think that's extremely favorable.
Great thanks for that color.
And we will go to our next question with Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI.
Hi this is Justin in for Jonathan.
Thanks for taking the question.
If I could just ask further on the investment grade and I know you said getting down to around 4.1 as your cost of debt but I was hoping to get more color on the total cost of capital if you are able to reduce to investment grade? Well I think ultimately that's determined by the market.
What I would tell you and based on the work that we've done if there is meaningful benefits to the company over time we believe from achieving investment-grade credit rating our aim as a business as we've talked about over the long period of time we think we can generate a significant amount of shareholder value by the way we add additional revenue to the existing assets that we own allocate the remaining portion of the capital outside of the dividend distribution smart investments like we've talked about this morning for small cells.
And then thirdly providing a risk profile of the business that lowers the cost of capital.
And there's a lot of things that go into that.
Part of it is how we allocate the capital and the percent of that capital that is distributed to shareholders in the form of basically a certain return on investment that's made.
We think another component of that is capital structure so that the business regardless of the cycle that the market may be in has a view that the business and the balance sheet are sustainable and can continue to achieve a low cost which provides additional certainty to the payment of the dividend.
And so I'll leave investors to make their own judgment on where they think ultimately the cost of the equity should fall.
Today if you look at where our credit rating is and where bonds are trading and if you were to assume that we were at the low end of an investment-grade credit rating there may be 80 to 100 basis points of a difference in where we would issue a bond a 10-year bond investment-grade non-investment grade.
So there are certainly some debt costs associated with that and improvement in the overall cost of debt but more broadly as we speak about this we think there are more broad implications in terms of how the business achieves a lower overall cost of capital over the long-term and that's why we're focused on it.
Great thank you.
And we will go to Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.
Thanks.
Good morning guys.
Hey Rick.
Hey.
Two questions if I could.
First I think Ben you were mentioning how a lot of the services business – it might have been Jay at your own towers if I remember right you guys had about 6 000 towers from Sprint back from the old Global Signal acquisition.
Are you seeing any activity from a services business standpoint in your guidance for Sprint starting to activate its Spark Project the 2.5 gigahertz stuff? Yeah.
Rick I think we are going to probably decline to get into specifics around what a particular career is doing on our sites.
You know we normally refer you back to them to talk about their own activity that’s sort of their business.
And we've talked about overall I think to Simon's original question overall activity we are seeing that’s consistent with what we saw at the beginning of the year and up a little bit as Jay mentioned in our guidance that we’ve trimmed up a little bit for the year of the first quarter.
So probably not going to get into a whole lot of specifics there.
I would actually make a comment about our services business though that's helpful to remind everybody.
In 2014 we grew that business about 40% which was consistent with the growth in the portfolio really over the last year or so from ‘13 as we brought on the AT&amp;T Towers.
So when we projected for 2015 that the services contribution would be similar to what we saw in ‘14 that's also consistent with the portfolio size.
So that's effectively what's happening this year is that we are running we think pretty well flat to last year's contribution which is consistent with the size of the portfolio and so just an observation for those that may not be paying that close attention to our history.
Okay.
And then a bizarre question next.
With Sprint we understand there is a lot of discussion with vendors equipment manufacturers about providing vendor financing to help them maybe look at deploying that Spark Project have you ever considered offering financing to carriers for higher rent? Let me just say this yes we have considered it.
It has been proposed and when we’ve looked at it we haven't found it to be an attractive proposition for us nor a gating factor that determined whether a carrier went on a site or not.
So obviously our objective is what we work on every day is getting carriers on our towers and we could not satisfy ourselves at providing financing or not would actually influence the buying decision whether they needed that tower or not.
So typically the carriers have access to capital for many different sources from public markets vendor financing as you suggest and we have had it proposed a few times and it frankly did not look that compelling to us to actually sway the buying decision and so we decided so far not to do it.
That makes sense right.
So a lot more nice to be a tower company than an equipment company.
The final question I've got for you is on the small cells Jay you mentioned 2 500 anchor or co-los are in backlog awarded but not in construction.
How much CapEx should we think is associated with that? And then you said one of the challenges is just deploying it.
Talk to us a little bit about the gating factors there is it money is it people what do we talked about there? The 2 500 that I referenced is a combination of anchor builds as well as co-locations on existing systems.
The anchor builds typically when we’re building new anchor builds we’re spending about $100 000 per node.
The majority of that cost is associated with building the fiber to build the system where those notes are going to go.
The amount of capital necessary as co-locate on existing systems is significantly lower than that.
What I would guide you towards is if you look at our activity in small cells and the amount of capital that we've been spending over the last several quarters our forward look is about the level that we’ve spent over the last two quarters if you were to annualize the two to three quarters if you were to annualize it maybe trending upwards a little bit.
Obviously as you've heard us talk about this business over time this is – it’s directly related to the returns that we see in the business.
So to the extent that the return stay intact as we see currently then we’re happy to continue to pursue RFPs and other initiatives that the carriers are launching in various markets to pursue to expand and frankly invest more capital than even our run rate would suggest as long as the return expectations stay the same.
So -- and I think the -- if you think then about what's the biggest hurdle the hurdle is not necessarily around not having enough capital to pursue it we have access to plenty of capitals continue to do it.
We would be focused on where the returns appropriately reflecting what we like about the business and where we think the growth is and then frankly do we have enough manpower to achieve and accomplish what the carriers are looking to do.
And really it's the gating factors as you suggested Rick are really the whole cycle of construction.
It’s the designing of the systems with the carriers input real estate permitting and then real estate rights securing those rights and then permitting and then the construction and the longer we’re at this the better we get we've got a lot of folks that are extremely good at what they do and I think actually by far leading position in the industry in that capability but it hasn’t necessarily shorten us the construction cycle and I'm very convinced it's a significant barrier to entry in this business because there is a lot to actually building on these systems and getting the carriers installed on time and on budget and we're getting pretty good at that.
If I remember right it was about $50 million last quarter $70 million this quarter so may be a $120 million for the last two quarters in CapEx or may be $240 million to $250 million annual is kind of what you're thinking like? That's our current -- that’s our current run rate and to the extent we find more opportunities we’re happy to invest more capital than that.
Great thanks guys.
And we’ll go to Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.
Thanks.
Jay what is the expected incremental small cell node revenue connections required to hit the midpoint high-end and low-end of guidance? Of the 2 500 in backlog how many will actually generate revenue by the end of December? Very little very little if any.
Typically once we started construction of small cells we’re in a 15 month to 18 month cycle in most cases.
So those would likely represent activity that will come online in 2016.
We have a very healthy backlog of nodes that are currently in construction.
If you look at our total revenue guidance 2014 to 2015 we’re expecting revenue growth of between $150 million and $160 million in total and small cells would comprise about $50 million to $60 million of that growth and towers being the remainder $100 million of that growth and that's the way it falls out.
Obviously a number -- when you look at the year-over-year impact a number of -- meaningful portion of that $50 million to $60 million of growth in small cells are nodes that we’re turning on now during the second quarter that will then produce revenue for the balance of the year.
And then if I start to look at the 5.0% organic cash growth and 2.3% cap growth and you factor in these small cell connections straight-line and incremental churn it appears you could see a nice bump up of cap and organic cash leasing growth in ‘16 is that the right way to think about it all else are being equal knowing what you know today? I think -- and we're certainly not going to give guidance this year in 2016 -- for 2016 but what I would tell you is we've laid out a five-year forecast of how we think AFFO per share growth on an organic basis of about 6% to 7% and add to that the dividend distribution that we're going to make.
Assumed in that is a level of leasing activity similar to what we saw in 2014 and saw in 2015 -- and are seeing in 2015.
The change that we expect to see in 2015 to 2016 is a reduction in the impact of churn.
In calendar year 2015 we’re expecting the impact of churn to be approximately $115 million and in 2016 as we've laid out our longer-term forecast for the non-renewals we expect that number to be approximately $75 million in 2016.
So the pickup that we would expect at least based on our longer-term forecast that we’ve provided to you would be not so much a change in activity we've assumed a similar level of activity but in the amount of non-renewables we’re assuming a reduction in that by about $40 million thereby increasing the amount of AFFO you want to think about it that way or net organic leasing.
It's about a 2% increase roughly at AFFO line if you’re comparing 2015 to what would be flowing through those assumptions in 2016 impact.
Got it.
And any color on straight-line for next year? I wouldn't give you that much -- I wouldn’t get into that much detail on this call.
We’ll give 2016 outlook when we get to the third quarter.
One thing that I would point it to which can be helpful if you're looking at that we are providing a significant amount of detail on that supplemental package and you can see what's currently on the book today and what the burn off of straight-line revenues overtime for years well beyond 2016 and those would reflect all of the leases that are currently signed and producing revenue and you can see how that flows I think out through 2022.
Great thank you.
And next we’ll go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.
Thank you very much and just following up on the prior question sort of understanding the longevity of what seems to be a healthy investment environment it does seem like your expectations are baking in sort of a reduction in the churn impact which should ease moving away from 2015.
I'm sort of sitting back and thinking we've got commentary out there that Sprint seems to be focused on network densification initiatives T-Mobile has been vocal about its A-Block spectrum build.
Obviously we just had the AWS-3 spectrum auctions and public safety if I start to put all of those pieces together can we find ourselves in a situation in which you have a spending environment that at least as good but potentially better when looking at all these sort of moving pieces from the carrier side? Sure.
Amir this is Ben.
Look I think everything you just outlined is possible and longer beyond even that is the deployment of AWS-3 spectrum that was just auctioned.
So -- and then you mentioned FirstNet potentially and then the Dish spectrum.
Having been at this for a long time like many of us here have there are always ebbs and flows and sure the leasing environment could improve in ‘16 or ’17.
I would caution you though that remember we’re adding about a $100 million of new revenue per year on the tower base today as Jay just mentioned.
And so if that were to increase by less just say 30% for example to take some of your upside that's a 1% change in revenue growth or about 2% change in AFFO growth.
So we work on that every day that's what everybody listening to this call looks at Crown is focused on but I want to caution you and it's one of the wonderful things about this business the inflections up or down are relatively muted and as we mentioned out of a 10% or 11% sort of total return profile two-thirds of that’s already on the books in the current dividend plus the contracted escalators.
So that last third which is growth absolutely focused on it but maybe the up and down on that is a couple of percentage points on AFFO growth which we’d love to see don't get me wrong but that's one of the wonderful things about the business is it’s not very movable to tell you the truth.
That's very helpful.
And then just a follow-up question here obviously you folks have taken a differentiated view versus some of your peers on the international arena.
We’re starting to hear some I guess chatter about potential assets coming available in Europe which is sort of a different investment profile than where we’ve seen sort of international expansion take place with some of your peers before.
I was wondering what your thoughts could be around if some of those assets became available whether or not they would be attractive and if that would sort of change a shift in focus for you as some of those assets became available? Sure.
It's certainly something we would look at.
We use to operate in the UK in a very large way.
The European market has developed in a much different way than North America so we would want to make certain that the underwriting of those assets are appropriately took into account and what the collocation opportunity was going to be over time there.
I would in a positive sense we’re marking our ability to finance locally there at a very attractive level so to the extent we have been looking at something there we could certainly put an implicit hedge on the currency by financing locally.
So there are a lot of attractive attributes to look into Western Europe it would come down in my mind to what’s the underwriting on the towers and what’s the opportunity for revenue growth around the marketplace there and there are some dynamics in the Western European market that's made it a little more challenging to underwrite collocation growth and so we would want to make sure we would get that right but I have absolutely no natural aversion to that and think it's something that we could certainly look at.
Thank you very much for the incremental color.
You bet.
And we will go to Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
Hi great.
Two questions if I may first off I was hoping you can give us a little bit of color on expectations for total CapEx for the remainder of the year based off the 205 [ph] that you just did in the first quarter but also at the macro site.
I was hoping if you could comment on whether or not you actually are seeing that? And if you are how that's changing if it is at all how carriers buy from you or what they buy from you? Thank you.
Colby on your first question around total CapEx as we gave the guidance previously I think we would expect to consume all of the excess cash flow if you were to take AFFO subtract out the dividend that we're – our current policy suggests for the balance of the year I think we will spend all of that on activities the vast majority of which is likely to be directed towards small cells.
As I answered one of the earlier questions about activity and interest in expanding it given the returns that we're seeing in small cells we would be willing to go beyond that cash flow amount and finance opportunities to the extent they exceeded the amount of cash flow that's produced but I think as a starting point what I would suggest is that you assume we utilize all of the excess cash flow beyond the dividend for investment in assets and that may ebb and flow a little bit quarter to quarter depending on how many projects we complete in any given quarter.
Colby without taking everybody through technology lessons I'm certainly not qualified to do on the call I will make one comment about what we’ve seen around the CWAN architecture and the possibilities there and it’s extremely early.
Essentially what it may do for us is it may remove some of the ground space requirements at towers and so to the extent you got a tower that may have a ground space challenge i.e.
not a very big footprint by moving those base stations offsite into sort of a base station hotel and remotely powering that through fiber is something that we look at positively over time and potentially makes the upgrade cost of some of the smaller monopoles diminished and makes them more attractive over time.
So it's extremely early but I think the trend will be if we go down that path with that kind of architecture is that it's going to add value to some of the smaller sites but potentially would have been challenging or expensive to add additional land and that may not be required now.
That's about all I have on that so far.
Okay great.
I'll take it.
Thank you.
Next we will go to Batya Levi with UBS.
Great.
Thanks.
Couple of follow-ups.
First on the CapEx spent on the existing sites I think it was $98 million can you talk about how much capacity that creates? And how -- if you could help us gauge what the incremental boost to revenue growth it would provide over the longer term and if that level shifts towards more small cells and sort of like a one quarter pickup? And then if you could also provide some color on that $15 million increase in the organic growth was that mostly coming from small cells and maybe the breakdown of activity in terms of amendments and new licenses? Thank you.
Okay sure.
On your first question when we spend CapEx on existing sites that's always success based as we like to say around the place.
The success base means that we don't spend any of the capital until there is a tenant ready to go on to that particular site.
And so in terms of increasing the capacity of our existing sites occasionally there is some natural increase to the capacity of the site than generally the site is made ready for the tenant who is standing there ready to go on it.
The impact that we have to revenues as we know oftentimes is a part of that transaction we received some upfront prepaid rents associated with the site and so it does benefit longer term recurring revenues as we receive some of that rent upfront rather than amortized on -- rather than receiving it on a cash basis month-to-month.
On your second question around the increase in $15 million that we increased 2015 outlook for site rental revenue virtually all of that is related to a small cell activity.
It was very little that came from towers the vast majority of it was small cell and achieved a good portion of that in the first quarter increasing our run rate for the balance of 2015.
The split of new licences and amendments very similar to what we expected.
We think full-year 2015 is pretty similar to what we saw in the quarter is in the neighborhood of 60% to 65% new licences and the balance being amendments that's what we saw approximately in 2014 and we expect a similar level in 2015.
Great thank you.
Next we will go to Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.
Okay.
Thank you very much for taking the questions most have been asked.
But I'm curious about when you talk about -- I think you said it both ways on the call so I'm hoping you can clarify this I believe you said AFFO but then also AFFO per share growth over the next five years in that 6% to 7% range.
So once we clear that up under what scenarios could we possibly see rather than that staying steady.
Given the spectrum allocation and more spectrum to come next year more deployments obviously it almost implies that you are predicting a headwind against some other growth given a backdrop of strong spectrum deployment and continued CapEx on the wireless side so if you could talk to that that would be helpful? Okay sure.
Well to clear up your first one that’s easy yeah we mean per share.
So AFFO per share is all we work on around here that's all that really matters.
So certainly -- and so our statement of 6% to 7% AFFO per share growth is our five-year outlook on what we can deliver.
And then to the headwind comment actually it's maybe exactly the reverse so let me walk you through as you can tell this year our guidance is about 5% AFFO growth and I would just point out that's carrying 800 basis points of non-renewals and about 100 basis points of FX headwind so you can -- I'm actually kind of proud of that if you look at the core growth in the business that we are able to generate that 5% net.
So the 5% net number this year if we are making a five-year statement saying 6% to 7% over five years we will then obviously then it has to pick up in the second through the fifth year.
And I think where Jay took the previous question is kind of where I would go which is for planning purposes we would suggest that we capture that additional growth to get back to that 6% to 7% over five years by the reduction in non-renewals as we've laid out in the supplement.
This is the peak year for non-renewals and as that tails off we pick up a couple of hundred basis points in the next year and probably more in the following year just on the basis of the same level of leasing.
And as I was answering the question earlier we will absolutely work on capturing additional leasing opportunities if they are there and there is a scenario where they are there.
I think that each of the carriers in their own way of talking about adding self-identity and the requirements to do that I think that's an inevitable outcome of the spectrum auctions and the demands being placed from the systems by mobile data as we talked about earlier.
So I think it's inevitable that we're going to see continued leasing I can't -- like we are seeing today I can't today forecast for you if that's going to sort of – a bunch of favorable trends conspired to the point where we pick up maybe another 30% of leasing which should be again 1% incremental revenue growth and about an incremental 200 basis points of AFFO line that would be tremendous if that happens but it would require that all four carriers sort of pull on their orders at the same time and that's not often the case in our industry.
We have people doing various stages of their deployment cycle that's always been the case and so it – we don't plan on seeing an inflection point up but there is a case that can be made that that's possible certainly and if it's there I can assure you will can capture it.
And then a quick follow-up actually you mentioned four carriers now we possibly might have a fifth with the announcement from Google yesterday on Project Fi can you give some thoughts have you had discussions with Google have you talked to them about this and how this may impact your business? We have actually had a number of conversations with Google I really won’t go into the substance of those but as you would expect they’re extremely well-versed in wireless and wireless networks.
I think what we see in their announcement yesterday is a continuation of what we've seen for a long time and that is there is a lot of outside companies with a vested interest in having access to wireless consumers.
And so that's always been the case and Google being the latest one.
I look at it as a net positive and that it’s going to drive to the extent they’re successful it's going to drive additional network capacity requirements into the Sprint and T-Mobile networks which fundamentally and gives them a revenue stream to then reinvest in network capacity to accommodate that demand.
And given the fact that and I don't say this lightly given the fact where we sit we are the most expeditious and cost-effective way to add network capacity unlike where we sit.
And so we’ll see how that develops over time but as carriers deploy additional spectrum as they add additional equipment and new cell sites we as Crown and frankly the industry are the most effective cost-effective way for that to occur.
Okay.
Thanks for taking those questions.
And we’ll take Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.
Hey guys.
Thanks for taking the question.
Given the new AMX tower spend in Mexico I just wanted to know if you have any thoughts on how the Mexican market compares to other international markets you looked at whether you're more comfortable with risk profile there? Thanks.
To be honest we haven't looked at that carefully lately.
It's true that in many emerging markets the case for wireless growth is very clear.
We can all understand how consumers who may not have had access to the wireless or certainly to the Internet now offered an affordable alternative would be high users of wireless data and a shared infrastructure model in many of these markets makes perfect sense.
It all depends on our mind on -- we bring the wrong currency to any other market that we would enter by definition and so it's completely a function of initial pricing the assets such that it reflects the risk undertaking -- we would be undertaking in terms of the currency movement and then what the fundamental growth on the revenue per site opportunity is in terms of collocation to achieve an attractive total return on investment.
And thus far in most of those markets frankly in all of those markets we haven't seen that price equation come back into sort of congruity for us but others have different views and so to me it's not a question of the business model it's purely a reflection on price and pricing in that mismatch of currency.
Thanks.
And just one more if I may on small cells.
The revenue growth has been accelerating pretty steadily for the last four or five quarters.
Could you talk about you know do you have enough longevity to know to get sense for the organic contribution that you've been seeing? I don't know how to parse that for you Spencer there's a lot of nomenclature in that business that's not the same as towers and so what I would say is we have a significant amount of collocation going on which you might say is okay well that's organic I would agree with you but every time you look at one of those there is always typically an additional lateral or two or three that a new carrier would take that the old carrier didn't and so that would not be organic that would be new if you will.
So I don't want to take with you all this on the call but it's a hybrid it's always a hybrid between collocation and new.
And if we look at our total growth in that business it's a significant contribution from colos and then a significant contribution from new.
That's about the tightest thing you might get.
Spencer I think one of the things just as you’re modeling the business and thinking about that you find over time is that in the tower cases you are building towers the input costs as well as monthly rents and the operating costs are relatively stable and have been for a long period of time when we look at small cells we’re really we’re making a financial transaction where we’re pricing the rent for the carrier the various components of the relationship between the carrier that installs there against a very different proposition.
The cost can vary per system the number of nodes per fiber mile can vary per system thus varying the amount of cost of fiber some of it can be aerial some of it can be buried we can be in locations where it's very expensive to dig up a sidewalk for instance in other places where the cost of laying fiber is not as high.
And so because the costs are so variable therefore the revenue and the margin in terms of nominal dollars vary.
And so as we think about the business and allocate capital we're always looking at it on a yield and total return basis and those conversations and systems look very different than what they do historically when we build towers.
So where we have given most of our disclosure and as we've talked about the businesses that you've heard on past calls and again this morning we focus on how is the yield on total investment doing and as we mentioned the largest portion of the $1.7 billion that we've invested was an asset that we bought at about 4% yield and we’ve taken the entire small cell contribution and returned on the investment that we’ve made in small cells.
We've taken that entire $1.7 billion to a 7% yield today which implies a significant amount of contribution on a -- I think as we could all call it organic basis.
But as Ben mentioned it's a blend so it's not as clean it’s just looking at if you own [ph] the tower yesterday and today and what portion of the revenues or cash flows came on a same tower basis it's not as clean.
So we focus more on yields and looking at yields and looking at driving total yields up on the existing total base of capital.
And maybe -- hopefully that's helpful color as you think about modeling the business.
Very helpful.
Thanks again.
I think we have time for maybe one more question.
And we’ll take our last question from Ana Goshko with Bank of America.
Hi thanks very much.
I will try to make it quick.
I just wanted to follow-up on the earlier comments and there is a lot of focus on the benefits of getting to an investment grade rating and the companies intend to do that in the short term but then when you talked about the potential completion of the Australian asset sale or unit stake you said the intend would be to leave leverage neutral and I’m wondering why isn’t that an opportunity to reduce leverage and really be the catalyst to get the company over the goal line into the investor grade rating? Sure Ana.
I think when we say leverage neutral; we mean that on a ratio basis not nominal dollars so we would think about it as maintaining leverage neutral on a ratio basis.
When we have looked at this and have done this over time for a long period of time there is obviously one would call away or a path towards getting to five times that is not necessarily necessary.
So we think about this and have worked on this for a number of years of letting the growth in EBITDA naturally deleverage the business towards investment grade and we don't see any impetus or need frankly to accelerate that beyond what we would see in due course.
So I think in all likelihood as Ben described if we’re ultimately successful in monetizing our Australia business unit then you should expect us to maintain leverage ratio neutral and then invest the balance of the capital in either assets or the purchase of our own stock and we’ll naturally grow towards getting to the investment grade credit ratios that we’re aiming towards.
I mean it's a great question I think the answer is we’re going to get there soon enough either way and so we don’t we would use that capital for incremental growth in all likelihood.
Okay and then just as a quick follow-up one of the issues with I think the overall rating is the company has taken advantage of the secured and securitized market where you do get a low cost of capital but that does put pressure on the rating.
Where are you guys I’m thinking of moving towards more of a investment grade type capital structure where you really have less secured and it does lift the pressure that the agencies put on the overall corporate rating? You’re right and I think over time as we get towards that investment grade credit rating and maybe even as we achieve it you’ll see us having more simplified capital structure today we have several entities underneath our parent that have availed themselves to securitize debt and that's enabled us to achieve a very low cost of capital even though leverage maybe outside of what would be typical be an investment grade credit.
So I think what you’ll see over time is we’ll clean up some of the complexity in the capital structure which will mean a lessening of our exposure to securitize debt and more of the debt move towards the holding company.
But I don't think you should expect that all of it will go away I think we’ll continue to avail ourselves of that market it gives us some diversity of sources of capital and even once we do achieve an investment grade credit rating I think we’ll still find that attracting some debt capital on a securitized basis with some portion of our assets makes good sense and helps to lower the overall cost of debt and capital.
Okay great.
Thank you very much.
Very good.
I think that wraps us up.
Thank you for staying with us.
I guess we went 70 minutes.
Appreciate everybody's attention and we look forward to speaking with you on next quarter’s call.
Thank you.
That concludes today’s conference.
Thank you for your participation.
Good day and welcome to the Crown Capital International Q2 2015 Earnings Conference call.
Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you Audra and good morning everyone.
Thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2015 results.
With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer.
To aid the discussion we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.
This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions and actual results may vary materially from those expected.
Information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the company's SEC filing.
Our statements are made as of today April 23 2015 and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.
In addition today's call includes discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.
Unless otherwise indicated our results and outlook that we will be discussing on this call reflects the Australian subsidiary as a discontinued operation.
As such all contributions from the Australian subsidiary has been removed from our historical continuing results and outlook including for periods prior to May 28 2015 when we completed the sale of our Australian subsidiary.
With that I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Thanks Son and good morning everyone.
The second quarter was another great quarter for our business.
Based on the strong results we achieved during the second quarter and our view for the remainder of the year we are raising our full-year outlook for 2015 for site rental revenues site rental gross margins adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
While I'm going to spend a significant portion of my prepared remarks walking through the various impacts of the two transactions that we announced during the second quarter I would like to summarize my comments by highlighting first that our base business is performing better that our previous expectations.
And secondly the net impact of the sale of our Australian subsidiary and the acquisition of Sunesys is expected to basically be a push with respect to run rate AFFO per share as we exit 2015.
We believe the combination of these two transactions is additive to our long-term growth rate and further solidifies our leadership position in the U.S.
market for wireless infrastructure.
By many measures the U.S.
wireless market is the most attractive market in the world for wireless investment driven by consumers who have a seemingly insatiable appetite for mobile data and the need for wireless to carriers to invest to meet such demand.
Based on the quality of our portfolio of towers and small cell networks we believe we are uniquely positioned for the long-term to help carriers further densify their networks to keep pace with consumer demand.
And we are well-placed to provide shareholders with predictable long-term AFFO and dividend per share growth.
Turning to our second quarter results on slide 4 site rental revenue grew 4% year-over-year from $711 million to $737 million.
Organic site rental revenue grew 6% year-over-year comprised of approximately 10% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations net of approximately 4% from non-renewals.
Moving to slide 5 adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the high-end of our previously provided second quarter 2015 outlook driven by higher than expected network services gross margin contribution inclusive of $7 million of equipment decommissioning fees.
Turning to investment activities as shown on slide 6 during the second quarter we invested $219 million in capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $27 million in sustaining capital expenditures and $28 million in land purchases.
During the second quarter we completed over 600 land transactions of which approximately 20% were purchases.
The remaining transactions were lease extensions averaging approximately 38 years.
Today approximately one-third of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own and approximately three-quarters on land we owned or leased for more than 20 years.
This number increases to 90% when we include ground leases of 10 years or more.
Where we have ground leases the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years.
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we look to control our largest operating expense and produce growing cash flow over time.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we invested $164 million in revenue-generating capital expenditures consisting of $103 million on existing sites and $60 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell construction activity.
Let me turn now to our strategic moves during the quarter.
As I previously mentioned at the end May we completed the sale of our Australian subsidiary for approximately $1.6 billion.
Net proceeds to Crown Castle was $1.3 billion after accounting for our 77.6% ownership repayment of the intercompany debt owed to us by our Australian subsidiary and estimated transaction fees and expenses.
We expect to utilize approximately $1 billion of our approximately $2 billion net operating loss carry forward to fully offset the tax gains from the sale of our Australian subsidiary.
Additionally as a result of the sale we expect a significant portion of our common stock dividend distributions during 2015 will be characterized as capital gain distribution.
The sale was opportune as it allows us to redeploy capital from a slower growth asset towards an opportunity with an expected higher growth profile in Sunesys.
Sunesys owns or has right to nearly 10 000 miles of fiber in major metro markets across the U.S.
where we already have a small self-presence today.
Sunesys is well-located high-quality fiber footprint more than doubled our fiber footprint available for small cell deployment.
The acquisition of Sunesys is expected to close during the third quarter.
Due to the timing difference between the completion of the sale of Australia and the expected closing of Sunesys we applied the net proceeds from the sale of Australia to pay down our revolving credit facility and term loan.
As such we expect to re-borrow under revolving credit facility and need cash on hand to fund the Sunesys acquisition at the time of closing.
Sunesys is expected to contribute approximately $80 million to $85 million to site rental gross margin with approximately $20 million of general and administrative expenses during our first full year of ownership.
We believe that as mobile demand continues to grow carriers will need to deploy small cells in conjunction with macro towers to address network congestion.
And while it's still early days we are seeing evidence that support our investment pieces.
Year-over-year site rental revenues from small cells grew in excess of 30%.
Today small cells represents about 8% of our site rental revenue.
Our small cells consists of approximately 7 000 miles of fiber supporting approximately 15 000 nodes on-air or under construction with another approximately 2 300-node opportunities awarded but not yet under construction.
Needless to say we are very excited by the opportunities presented in small cells which we believe builds on our core competency as the leading provider of U.S.
wireless infrastructure leverages our existing relationships with the wireless carriers and enhances our long-term growth in AFFO and dividend per share.
Shifting to financing activities during the quarter we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per share or $274 million in aggregate.
During the second quarter we issued $1 billion of securitized notes to refinance other indebtedness.
The notes were issued at a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and a weighted average expected maturity of nine years.
Today our weighted average cost of debt stands at 4.2% with a weighted average maturity of six years with no meaningful maturities until 2017.
As of June 30 our total net debt to last quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA is 5.2 times.
We continue to maintain our target leverage at 5 times as we remain focused on achieving an investment-grade credit rating.
We were pleased that we are recently upgraded to investment-grade by Fitch Ratings which is an excellent step towards our goal of accessing the investment-grade unsecured bond market at our holding company.
We believe maintaining an appropriate balance sheet will provide us with flexibility to opportunistically pursue growth opportunities broaden our access to capital and lower our cost of capital.
As we think about funding potential discretionary growth investments that exceed our ability to fund with cash flow and continue on our path towards investment grade with the other rating agencies we anticipate financing our discretionary investments in a manner consistent with our leverage target using a combination of debt and equity as appropriate.
As such during the third quarter similar to many other REITs we intend to put in place an at-the-market program of $500 million which will give us the ability to opportunistically raise limited equity capital if we have opportunities to make investments that we believe will increase our growth rate and future dividends per share.
Obviously we would only expect to utilize equity or debt to the extent the investments exceeded our ability to fund with cash flow and we believe were accretive to dividends and growth after factoring in the full cost of the capital raised.
Moving on to full-year 2015 outlook on slide 7 we have increased our expectation for the operating results of our business.
Compared to our previously provided outlook adjusted for the disposition of Australia we have increased the midpoint of our full-year 2015 outlook for site rental revenue site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.
Our outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2015 does not include the expected contribution from the Sunesys acquisition which again is expected to close during the third quarter of 2015.
The increased outlook for site rental revenue and site rental gross margin reflects the strong results from the second quarter and the increase in our expectations for leasing in the back half of the year and an adjustment to the expectation of tenant non-renewals to occur later in the year than we previously expected.
It's important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant non-renewals during the calendar year 2015 and in aggregate remain unchanged.
Thinking forward to next year we currently expect the impact from total non-renewals to be approximately $15 million less than what we expect in 2015.
More detailed information regarding out contracted tenant leases and expectations for non-renewals is available on our supplemental information package on our website.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA the increased outlook for adjusted EBITDA reflects higher expectations for site rental gross margin and our increased expectations for network services gross margin contribution.
Our expectation for network services gross margin compared to our previously provided outlook has increased from approximately $260 million at the midpoint to approximately $275 million to $280 million primarily driven by the strong performance year-to-date.
For the full-year 2015 we expect to generate approximately $25 million to $30 million in equipment decommissioning fee the majority of which we don't expect to repeat in future years.
Our third quarter 2015 outlook assumes network services gross margin contribution of approximately $60 million to $65 million with minimal benefit from equipment decommissioning fees.
Moving on to AFFO the increase in AFFO includes the upward guidance and adjusted EBITDA offset by an increase in sustaining capital expenditures.
We expect an elevated amount of sustaining capital expenditures during the second and third quarters as we continue to integrate and digest our significant expansion in the U.S.
Our sustained capital expenditure outlook for 2015 of approximately $90 million includes approximately $20 million in facilities investment which we do not expect to recur in 2016.
Wrapping up as we look at the leasing application pipeline heading into the end of the year I am looking forward to finishing up the year strong and believe we remain on track to generate annual AFFO growth of 6% to 7% organically.
And with that I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Thanks Jay.
And thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
As Jay mentioned the second quarter was another terrific quarter.
We continued our track record of delivering great results driven by a strong leasing backdrop as evidenced by our gross organic site rental revenue growth of 10%.
Without going into too much detail on specific carrier deployment plans we are pleased with what we see both in towers and small cell and the year is ahead of our original expectations.
As noted we believe we're in a multiyear network densification cycle that will result in all four wireless carriers making significant investments and stand ready to meet their needs across the business.
As shown on slide 7 we have a record of execution and growth through various cycles whether it be macroeconomic or industry-specific cycles.
I appreciate that with the sale and discontinued operations treatment there can be some confusion with our numbers for the quarter and full year.
Let me try to simplify this for you.
We expect with Sunesys to exit 2015 with run rate AFFO per share equivalent to our expectations prior to the transactions.
And we have created the industry-leading portfolio of assets and expertise that is uniquely positioned and focused on the U.S.
wireless market.
Today we are the only company with the capability to deliver across all means of shared infrastructure to meet the network densification needs of the U.S.
wireless carriers.
Of course this includes our 40 000-tower portfolio 71% of which are in the top 100 markets our DAS and small cell portfolio with 15 000 nodes supported by 16 000 miles of metro fiber with the addition of Sunesys concentrated in the top 25 markets and importantly the capability to deploy its scale for carriers through our nationwide project management services business and implementation expertise.
The assembly of this portfolio and expertise has been a long-term objective of the Crown Castle management team.
But we are now 100% focused on serving the U.S.
wireless market the most attractive market in the world for wireless investment.
Although wireless has become a part of our lives we still believe we're in the early days of products services and business models our infrastructure will ultimately support.
Our ability to consistently execute as a function of our business model the quality of our portfolio with towers and small cell networks the team that operates the portfolio and our disciplined approach to capital allocation and the balance sheet.
Our focus remains on co-locating tenants on a long-term committed basis on our shared wireless infrastructure resulting in increasing yields on our investments while at the same time providing the wireless carriers with the most cost-effective access to wireless infrastructure as they seek to intensify their networks to meet growing consumer demand.
This demand in the U.S.
mobile data market as reported in a recent Cisco report grew 63% in 2014 and going forward Cisco projects a sevenfold increase between 2014 and 2019.
As has historically been the case network investments by the carriers have generally kept up with consumer usage.
We believe the launch of robust content-rich video including live sports and unbundling of cable or so-called over-the-top TV products available on wireless devices that promises a new leg of growth in mobile data on wireless networks requiring more spectrum and infrastructure to realize its full potential.
Further we anticipate current or future spectrum licensees beyond the big four wireless carriers will add to our customer base over time.
The derivative demand from DISH FirstNet and others in the future promises to extend our leasing opportunity beyond what is visible today.
For context as explained on slide 8 during the 1990s or the 2G technology cycle average annual U.S.
wireless capital expenditures across all the wireless carriers totaled $7 billion.
During the 3G cycle of the 2000s which can be characterized as the era of basic mobile e-mail and web browsing average annual U.S.
wireless capital expenditures increased to $21 billion across the carriers.
And since 2010 with the deployment of 4G and LTE products for mobile broadband annual U.S.
wireless capital expenditures have averaged $29 billion.
Looking forward over the next several years we believe that the current level of investment by U.S.
wireless carriers will be sustained.
The U.S.
wireless market has one of the most compelling wireless investment stories in the world.
With strong unit economics and relatively high ARPU reflecting U.S.
consumers' demand for mobile data and their willingness to pay for mobile services U.S.
carriers were able to generate positive incremental returns on their capital investments.
The carriers are driven to increase this investment because as has been true since the early days of wireless network quality continues to be the market differentiator for carriers' success.
Based on this long-term need to invest by the U.S.
carriers we have focused our investments over the last several years in the U.S.
market.
Our towers are well located but over 70% of our portfolio in the top 100 markets and have significant runway for additional growth with only two tenants on average per tower or what I would consider about a 50% occupancy rate.
Towers continued to be the most efficient and cost-effective procure us to add network capacity and coverage and support our bullish long-term view on tower leasing.
In addition to towers we have also invested significantly over the last several years in building out small cell networks with our latest investment being the pending acquisition of Sunesys as we've mentioned.
Given what we're seeing from the wireless carriers and the challenges they face with bringing more capacity online in many urban and suburban geographies we believe the deployment of small cells is a critical tool to improving network quality.
Similar to towers we believe some of the best assets will be those that are secured early on where franchise value will help drive future co-locations upgrade and expansions.
And that is why we're so excited about the pending acquisition of Sunesys which will bring our fiber footprint to more than 16 000 miles more than doubling our presences in the U.S.
top U.S.
metro markets.
For those not familiar with small cells this is a shareable wireless infrastructure that provides wireless carriers with a solution to address network capacity constraints where a macro tower site is not available or is insufficient.
Small cells are a fiber-fed solution connecting at network of antennas or nodes that allow wireless carriers to get closer to the consumer increase network density and deploy spectrum more efficiently.
Like tower leasing tenant leases on small cells are typically long-term with 10 to 15 year committed terms with annual escalators.
And like towers our fiber investment for small cells is agnostic to changes in technology.
And while it is an oversimplification small cells can be thought of as a tower laid on its side a horizontal tower replacing the tower structure in this example with fiber.
At its core fiber is the critical shareable element in small cells.
The vast majority of our investment in building out a small cell network consists of the investment in fiber.
Today we are building small cell networks with initial yields of 6% to 8% that should result in returns above 20% on just a second tenant reflecting the operational leverage inherent in the business.
As Jay mentioned we recognize that small cells is in its early stages.
And we're using our first mover advantage to extend our leadership in U.S.
Wireless infrastructure leveraging our existing relationships with our customers and enhancing our long-term growth in AFFO and dividends per share.
As is our practice we constantly evaluate discretionary investments against purchasing our own stock or other available alternatives in the market on a risk-adjusted basis.
We believe this disciplined approach maximize the shareholder value over time.
We are very excited about the prospects to continue to extend our long and successful track record of growth and value creation.
This business has proven itself to be very durable through economic cycles due to our long-term recurring revenue contracts contracted escalators and organic growth profile that we enjoy.
Our business combined with very significant dividend payout is unique in the market yet trades with one of the highest dividend yields among S&amp;P 500 companies.
In fact out of 421 dividend-paying companies in the S&amp;P 500 377 companies have a lower dividend yield than Crown Castle putting us in the bottom 10% pile of dividend payers.
We believe the current valuation is disconnected from the reality of the high quality predictable yield and growth that we expect the business to deliver and represents an attractive opportunity for shareholders to benefit.
And with that operator I've concluded my remarks and would be happy to address questions.
Thank you.
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital Markets.
Yes.
Thanks for taking the question.
So I was interested in the small cell expectations for the year on [indiscernible] how much of that is going to be from new deployments and initial tenancy versus second or third tenancies on existing small cell infrastructure? And then secondly if you could comment on which carriers besides Verizon that you would expect to become most active in leveraging this business? Sure Jon.
As you've seen before the bright line demarcation between anchor builds and co-location is a little fuzzy in this business because it's typical that you'll have pure co-location with additional laterals built on an existing system.
But as a general matter today I think the best number I can give you is probably about 80% in anchor builds today and about 20% co-location.
That's about as close as I can cut it.
And we're going to work on obviously getting that more refine for you over time but we're very very pleased with what we see.
We've seen that significant amount of co-location on the original NextG systems that we acquired three years ago and more to come.
And speaking of that you asked about what are we seeing from other carriers? Well the most active this year has been Verizon as we talked about it.
I think they've confirmed on their own call.
But we are seeing activity from all four carriers today.
And so - and I would say that's up markedly from a year ago in terms of activity and bookings sort of where we are through the midpoint of the year.
We're very excited with what we see right now in terms of the prospects for the future business.
Thank you.
We'll move next to Michael Rollins at Citi.
Hi.
Thanks for taking the question.
Two if I could.
First I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the new revenue that you're getting from the towers specifically and as you continue to operate the T-Mobile portfolio and the AT&amp;T portfolio that you purchased is there an opportunity for that new revenue contribution to get bigger over the next few years? And then secondly just if I could ask on small cells.
Do you see a risk that a national carrier might go to a single-source supplier for small cells or become more proprietary in their approach for small cells? Or do you see this being a multiple-supplier opportunity? Thanks.
Sure Mike.
Broadly we are very pleased with the most recent acquisitions of the T-Mobile and the AT&amp;T towers that we've seen.
In any given year as you know we've got - both been assets a long time.
We know that the various carriers do various things across the course of the year.
And the most active carriers this year - no surprise I think to anyone on this call - are Verizon and T-Mobile.
So AT&amp;T and Sprint less active thus far but that gives us no less enthusiasm for what the future holds for all four carriers in terms of making investments to improve their network over time.
And that ebbs and flows and that's what's happening today.
But we are seeing activity on both of those portfolios and very pleased with the outcome thus far.
Again it's I guess two and three years in on those so it's still early days.
On the small cell side I think what we're going to see develop there and it's already happening is it's a big world out there.
There's going to be a number of competitors; there already are.
I think ExteNet one of our large competitors announced a transaction this morning in a recapitalization with Digital Bridge.
So I think you're going to - I think it's unlikely any one company frankly has that capability to handle a full-scale deployment for a carrier.
I think you could see potentially that on the equipment side more concentration on the equipment side.
But in terms of the infrastructure it takes - it will take a number of firms and obviously geography matters.
And so if you've got infrastructure in the critical areas where the carriers need it well that's going to be more efficient to go on that existing infrastructure just like the tower model.
So it's a big world out there.
It's getting larger frankly by the week as we look at additional bookings that we're getting.
And I think it's going to be a very healthy and robust market for many years.
Thanks very much.
We'll go next to Phil Cusick at JPMorgan.
Hey guys.
Thanks.
First you mentioned activity levels picking up in the press release and you've alluded to this a couple of times but can you talk about from who and then what ways activity levels are picking up? Is that more for bookings going into 2016 or could we see a little impact in 2015? Sure Phil.
The biggest drivers as Ben just mentioned this year of leasing activity would be Verizon and T-Mobile and to a lesser extent AT&amp;T and Sprint.
And we've seen pickup kind of across the board as we've gone through the year but the weighting has stayed relatively similar among those carriers.
Most of the activity that we're seeing in terms of pickup relates to brand new full installations on towers.
And the pickup there does have some revenue impact in our second quarter results as we were able to beat sire rental revenue our expectation for site rental revenue in the second quarter.
There weren't any one-time items that really helped us there.
We expect that to flow through for the balance of the year and we slightly raised our expectation for how leasing is going to develop over the balance of the year.
That benefits us as we go into obviously 2016.
The only caution I would have there for you as we've talked about in previous calls from a sensitivity standpoint we're obviously trying to find every lease that we can possibly find and put as many tenants on the towers as we can possibly find but a meaningful increase in leasing is not that impactful to our overall results.
So this year 2015 we assume that we're going to see about $90 million to $100 million of revenue growth on towers.
If leasing activity were going to pick up by 20% love to have it and we'll do everything we can to get it that's about $20 million which would represent about 1% impact to AFFO.
So as we've talked about and set our long-term targets of trying to organically grow AFFO per share in the neighborhood of 6% to 7% inside of that range we allow for some movement up or down from the current levels of activity.
And we think that's a pretty good band of activity.
So we're seeing a little bit of pickup had a little bit benefit to it this year at the margin.
Got it.
And if I can ask one more can you talk about the Sunesys deal a little bit.
I assume that they're sort of non-Crown revenue will mostly go into services going forward.
And how do you think about that growing? I think you've been building up that team? We have been building up a team.
The vast majority of their revenue will actually be in our site rental revenues line item.
The average term remaining on those contracts is just over five years.
So the terms of the contracts have escalators in them look similar to what we see on the tower side the main focus for the acquisition of Sunesys though wasn't necessarily how they utilize the fiber but our view over the long-term that given the location of this fiber [audio gap] (31:39-31:40) activity we've seen and opportunities we have in front of us.
Currently there's a lot of opportunity to add small cells across that fiber and increase the yield on that asset.
So most of our focus is really on adding additional small cells to the base of the revenue that's already there.
Got it.
Thanks guys.
We'll go next to Simon Flannery at Morgan Stanley.
Thanks a lot.
Jay you talked a little bit about the improvement in leverage and the Fitch upgrades can you just talk a little bit about where - if you believe - how long do you think it will take one or two of the other rating agencies to upgrade you and what's the opportunity there on your cost to funding from that? Thanks.
Yeah.
Simon I hate to put a date on it.
We're obviously been working hard with them have had numerous conversations with them.
I think from a financial policy standpoint we've been really disciplined as we've accomplished acquisitions over the last several years of maintaining our leverage target and operating within them.
Our goal as I stated during the conversation is to get the five turns of leverage.
We see a path towards that in a relatively near-term as we operate the business and see growth in adjusted EBITDA.
As we look at the targets that the other two agencies have published they would suggest as we get in that neighborhood of that leverage target then we should see an upgrade towards investment grade.
So we're continuing to have conversations and tell the Crown Castle story and make sure they understand where we're headed and how we're thinking about being disciplined around financial policy.
I think you'd have to ask them in terms of exact timing on when it occurs.
And the cost opportunity? The cost opportunity is probably about 100 basis points in terms of spread.
So underlying interest rates obviously don't have an impact to that.
But the spread we think is 100 basis points and on a good day maybe as much as a 152-basis-point reduction in the overall cost to capital.
One of the things that you've heard us talk about in the past is we think it's likely while we're not going to predict exactly when rates are going to rise the possibility here over time given the broader environment that we enter into are rising rate environment over the next several years.
And one of the reasons why we're focused on getting to the investment-grade target is to mitigate that rise in rates by reducing the overall credit spreads in the business.
And so we think we will be able to mitigate some of that and hope to achieve that rating in the near term.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Ric Prentiss at Raymond James.
Thanks.
Good morning guys.
Hey Ric.
Hey.
A couple of questions focused around small cells.
Fiber backbone obviously is a large part of the small cell business you guys are doing.
We've been picking up some buzz that some carriers are maybe going to consider using spectrum as the primary backhaul mechanism for some small cell deployments.
Where is that appropriate? Have you heard anything about that? Yeah Ric we're certainly aware of other what would be called small cell architectures and certainly they have different applications and different power or different coverage and capacity opportunities at a particular node.
I think we're going to see a variety of those be deployed over time.
I think you're going to see dark service lit service some of it with wireless backhaul some of it with connectivity directly.
And I think you're going to see a lot of that over time for a variety of applications.
I can't really get into anything specifically.
I realized there are some conversations out there about one carrier and potentially what may be going on.
Really can't comment on any of that specifically.
But from how we are looking at the business fiber connectivity will be very important for the vast majority of these connections over time.
And even to the extent you've got microwave backhaul occurring from some small cells ultimately gets backhauled into a node that's connected to fiber.
So I think the opportunity for us and to provide meaningful capacity enhancements for these networks is ultimately going to continue to reside on fiber-fed systems.
Okay.
And then with Sunesys I think Jay you mentioned $80 million to $85 million of gross margins in the first 12 months.
How much of that kind of first 12 months is the core Sunesys business that you have today? How much of that is then poking small cells on top of that fiber? Ric almost all of that would be the margin that comes with the business.
And our working assumption is that after we close as is typically the case it will take us 6 to 12 months to sort of get our feet on the ground and start to produce additional yield on the assets.
So virtually all of that is in the books today and then we'll look to add it once we get it integrated.
And kind of back to Jonathan's question earlier organic versus external will you break out some details for us? I think Jay you mentioned Sunesys is - most of it is going to show up into the leasing business.
How can we get at kind of what Sunesys is coming? Are you going to give us some specific reported segment information maybe? Yeah.
I think - as we think about the business and the way we're going to operate it we'll focus on the Sunesys business as being a small cell business and a part of overall small cell.
So that's how we're thinking about how we plan to operate the business.
I think we're always looking in evaluating whether or not something warrants being a separate segment in the business.
Obviously over time small cells have grown.
We see more opportunity for growth there.
So as we integrate Sunesys and grow the small cell business we'll look at whether or not it warrants being a separate segment in the overall financial statement.
I know you've seen this Ric but just for the benefit of others.
We are providing a significant amount of detail around small cells in the supplement and trying to show both revenue growth on a separate basis there and what we're seeing in small cells.
And I think over time as the business grows you'll see us continue to expand the amount of detail that we're providing on that business.
It's going phenomenally well and we love to telling a good story.
Great.
In iDEN churn did I pick up that you said churn was a little slower but expect to come in at where it was for the year? Was there an updated iDEN churn number? iDEN is coming in as we expected.
And as we completed the second quarter we believe we basically have the vast majority of iDEN churn now behind us.
It's going to start - continue to obviously roll through the financial statements for the balance of the year as the current run rate has stepped down there.
But our expectation there has not changed.
The three acquired networks that we - we refer to them as acquired networks which would be the lead to Metro and the Clearwire network.
We did take down our expectation for the contribution or amount of run rate revenues that impact us during calendar year 2015.
But the absolute number of leases that we see churn there we think holds from our previous expectations.
They're just going to happen later in the year.
So obviously the impact of that is it will have a little more impact when considering the step between 2015 to 2016.
And our best expectation as we sit here today we'll give you more full detail on what we think our outlook for 2016 is when we do our third quarter call.
Our expectation at this point is we see a step down in the impact from churn next year somewhere in the neighborhood of about $15 million as we look at our outlook for 2016 and the effect of that is basically the runoff of the iDEN churn as well as little lower less impact from the acquired networks.
Great.
Thanks Jay.
And we'll go next to Brett Feldman at Goldman Sachs.
Thanks for taking the question.
You've obviously been growing the DAS business significantly and I imagine you've been investing in overhead and other operating cost items.
Can you give us a sense I mean what is the EBTIDA contribution from your DAS business today? And at what point should we expect to see maybe more operating leverage coming out of that segment? Well Brett as you know it's sort of one of my pet projects I shared with my management team.
That will spend a lot of time on this that we have and I appreciate you acknowledging it when you're growing a business with the opportunity as large as we see we're not only investing capital but we're investing in run rate overheard G&amp;A.
We're investing in people facilities everything you've seen.
And that's been the case over the last couple of years.
I would expect - and we're obviously working on giving you some clarity around that for 2016 outlook.
I would expect you're going to start to see more operating leverage in that business as we move into 2016.
That's just the nature of we're sort of getting close to being sort of that scale.
We are seeing as we mentioned significant increase in bookings that it will turn into revenue in 2016 and 2017 and more of that will start to scale.
I can't put numbers on it for you today but that is - trust me it's sort of our first second third priority around here right now.
Brett one of the things that's unique about this business and just going back from a history standpoint as we look back to the early days of the tower business the vast majority of the assets that we owned in the early days of the tower business were towers that we acquired from the carriers.
So we did early transactions with Bell Atlantic and GTE and BellSouth.
And those towers came with about a tenant and a half and you had scale.
The hardest thing to do in the early days when we were running the business was building towers because we were out building 1 000 to 2 000 towers a year.
And as you put those towers on line it takes a meaningful amount of G&amp;A to operate just purely the construction portion of the business.
And so when you look at the amount of yields on the assets if you look out on these two separate activities one activity is the assets you've already built and then the potential to add cash flows to those assets.
As soon as the assets are on line you start to see incremental returns on those assets.
As we add additional capital though as we've been doing and build out additional sites it ends up masking the underlying strength of the business and the expansion of the margins because we're incurring G&amp;A as well as additional operating expense to build out new systems.
So as we look at the business and think about how it's performing we focused on both.
We're focused on the investment of capital and evaluating each incremental activity or opportunity to invest capital and we're seeing the opportunity there day one of somewhere in the neighborhood of about 6% to 7% yield.
And then as Ben mentioned in his comments as we add a second tenant we see those returns go into the mid-20s.
And so given what we're seeing on the investments we've made so far where we believe appropriately focused on looking to expand that focused on the top markets in the U.S.
and really utilizing our first-mover advantage to continue to expand the portfolio.
And in our view this is like the early days of towers for small cells and we've seen the movie before.
It's the margin expansion takes a little bit of time.
But as we add assets - as we add tenants to great assets over time we'd see a tremendous amount of expansion on the returns and that's what we're focused on doing.
We think it's beneficial over the long term to our growth rate.
So we're focused on making sure we build the right assets and then grow the cash flows from there.
Great.
And if I sort of combine that with some other statements you may - Ben mentioned that.
You do think you're going to get more operating leverage on the DAS next year.
You'd also talked about how some of the churn is expected to diminish next year which presumably would be better for operating leverage in the tower business and you're buying fiber in the form of Sunesys that you can deploy revenue on top of that as demand materializes.
It just seems like as we sort of sanity-check our numbers for 2016 I know you're not going to give us guidance now that one of the sanity checks would be there should be much better conversion of revenue growth into EBITDA and AFFO as they move out this year.
Is that directionally correct? Yeah.
I think there's a few things moving on in the numbers moving around in the numbers.
If we talk about services we're getting some benefit this year from pay-and-walk fees of about $25 million to $30 million that we would not expect to occur again in 2016.
So that will be a little bit of a headwind to us.
On the plus side we've got sustaining capital expenditures coming down about $20 million next year from what we have this year.
So there's a bit of a wash there maybe a little bit of a headwind $10 million or so of a headwind.
I think where I would go to though is focus on where we're focused which is growth and AFFO per share.
And our long-term target of 6% to 7% is where we're trying to operate the business to.
Love it if it's more but our view is that that's about where the business is going to perform given at the current level of leasing.
In 2015 and 2016 that we've shown in the supplement the headwinds from churn are more significant than what we would expect over the long-term in the business.
So 2015 if you're looking at that on an apples-to-apples basis we think we're going to be below the target of 6% to 7% coming off of the base in 2014.
Next year I think we'll probably be inside of that range maybe towards the lower end of it.
But inside of that 6% to 7% long-term target.
And then we'll do the best we can to do better than that over the course of the year.
But once we at least based on our current view of where churn is and where the various items are moving around Brett I think that's the best I can give you until we get to the third quarter to focus on having the business to operate somewhere in the neighborhood of that 6% to 7%.
And given the pluses and minuses at this point it's probably at the lower end of that 6% to 7%.
Great.
Thank you for that color.
Yeah.
We'll go next to Kevin Smithen at Macquarie.
I wondered if you could give us a little color on to contracted backlog or bookings in the small cell business I think you have in the past given us a little color.
And I want to see what the change was quarter to quarter and sort of what you're contracted 2016 revenue under backlog would be in that segment.
Yeah.
Kevin as you know we're not segment disclosing yet on that to the extent we ever do.
But I'll give you some color.
Our bookings thus far through midyear are up significantly compared to last year.
So that again will turn in the revenue in 2016 and 2017.
I'm not prepared to quantify that directly for you but it's up materially from what we saw last year.
And against our plan for the year we're running ahead of where you expect us to be midyear.
So we're very enthusiastic about that.
As I mentioned earlier though a lot of that work is anchor builds.
And so that will come on with a lower margin than you would expect it to be when you lease up to second tenants over time to co-location.
So while it's a material amount of incremental revenue it gets muted because it's an anchor build on that and so you're bringing on new operating expenses on this systems as well.
So look we'll get you more color I think as we look out - as we think about our 6% to 7% target over the longer term which we originally gave you in 2014.
As Jay just walked you through we picked up about a point next year on reduction in churn.
If that continues to normalize we would expect that happen over subsequent years as well.
And so we're going to continue work towards getting that total return out there that's very attractive between the current yield and growth.
On ExteNet were you surprised that SBA didn't acquire this asset and doesn't this give you sustainable product suite with advantage with your largest customer or the largest customer horizon on small cells versus your public peers? Well look as you can tell we're very pleased with the business.
And I think that the ExteNet transaction is - obviously it's tremendous for the shareholders that are exiting.
And I think it's a validation of the opportunity that we see in the marketplace with Digital Bridge coming in.
As I mentioned earlier it's a big world out there and there's going to be a number of competitors.
But the geography the opportunities continue to frankly amaze us and we're going about as hard as we can.
We've told you that before on the other calls and that remains true today.
Thanks a lot.
We'll take our next question from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Hey guys.
Thanks.
So maybe just first Jay you know in the supplements as you kind of point out there's a nice uptick in the expectations for the new leasing activity from 5.6% to 6% year-over-year.
I imagine a portion of that is related to just stripping out the slower-growing Australia business from the comparisons and then some of it is related to kind of the activity.
If you could kind of split that out between the two forces it would be helpful.
And then I guess for maybe Ben just maybe following up on something Ric mentioned earlier.
I guess the big conversation now on architecture in towers is always something new is Cloud-RAN and whether it's wireless of fiber-based backhaul the idea that we're not going to need as much equipment at the tower from an intelligence standpoint.
Could you kind of talk about A whether how real it is in terms of what you see happening on the ground in the business.
And B if it does become real what does it really mean for your kind of core business view? Thanks.
Sure.
Dave on your first question removing Australia does help the growth rate a little bit but Australia only represented about 5% of our site rental revenue.
So it would get lost in the rounding trying to back that out and see the benefit of it.
The real 40-basis-point move or the vast majority of it is a legitimate increase in the amount of activity that we expect in the calendar year.
As I mentioned in my comments some of that was achieved during the second quarter and flows through the balance of the year.
And then some of it is an increased expectation in leasing.
That increase in expectation is largely based on what we're seeing on towers.
Where we are on small cells doesn't have that meaningful of an impact on that number.
So the vast majority of what you're seeing there in the uptick of 40 basis points on the growth rate is coming from towers.
[Inaudible] And I would just add to that the 10% gross growth we're quite proud of obviously that includes the organic growth of leasing and then the escalators on top of that.
So that 10% number which is consistent for the balance of the year is something that we think is highly indicative of a pretty robust market.
Dave to your question about C-RAN it's very early as we're being told by our customers as we've talked to them about some of these opportunities.
But over time I think the net impact to us as tower owners is that it probably brings some of the smaller sites that have more smaller ground footprint more into play for co-location to the extent they were challenging on a ground footprint you couldn't add to it because the C-RAN architecture typically locates what we think of as base stations offsite more like - it frankly looks more like the architecture on a small cell network.
It just happens to terminate on a tower.
It looks to us like over time we could see less equipment on the ground potentially but not less in the air.
I think you're still going to have active remote radio heads and potentially more antennas up the tower as more spectrum is utilized in trying to get maximum spectral efficiency out of their installations.
So I think it's a material architectural evolution that will probably happen over the next decade.
But from our take today it looks like it probably has positive effects on ground space and really doesn't affect what's up the tower.
And that's my best view as we sit here today.
And Ben if I could just follow up.
But just in terms of some of the contracts and thinking about kind of bucketing out the revenue contributions.
I mean obviously we're talking something way down the road.
But if your average new cell is $2 000 today and all of a sudden your carrier customers don't need as much ground space is that a $1 900 contract all of a sudden or is it $2 000 package deal and you use it how you want to use it.
Yeah.
I think over time the pricing in our industry has continued to evolve a little bit.
But ultimately it relates to what's the load on the tower and potentially the shareable economics of the tower are always in play to the benefit of the carriers.
Meaning we as a company take that lease-up risk as you're certainly aware and we'll make the tower available to them on a very attractive single-digit yield.
That's what happened in all of the large sale leasebacks whether the initial yield was sort of in the 4% to 5% range for most of these transactions and then we lease it up from there.
So my view on that long-term pricing scheme is that no matter how you - what the nomenclature is or how you denominate the pricing it ultimately is going to go to yield on the asset.
And I think we as a company - and I certainly won't speak for my competitors but we as a company ultimately think about this as a shared model and providing that shareable economic to the carrier customer such that with multiple tenants on a tower we're going to yield above our cost of capital above the cost to own and operate that site.
And that's going to be the case no matter how you denominate how we charge for rent.
And so it's not getting any easier to locate towers that is for certain.
And so these assets have a very significant franchise value and I'm very confident that we'll be able to attract the yield that's above our cost of capital for the foreseeable future just as we've done on the legacy Crown sites that are over 15% per tower on a yield basis with three tenants per tower.
Got it.
All right.
Thanks guys.
We'll go next to Colby Synesael at Cowen &amp; Company.
Great.
Two questions if I may.
First one I just want to get some context on guidance.
You mentioned obviously that you're expecting $25 million to $30 million in [indiscernible] decomissioning.
Can you tell us what was previously assumed in your guidance I'm not sure if that have been previously disclosed.
And then as it relates to 2016 I'm sure you could appreciate that there's - from an investor perspective a lot of excitement around what we could see in 2016 in terms of demand relative to 2015 particularly from AT&amp;T and Sprint.
I was wondering if you could talk about what you're actually seeing from those two providers as we stand here today in terms of some of the activity and what that might mean for 2016.
Thanks.
Sure.
On the first question Colby originally we had expected paying [indiscernible] fees to be about $20 million in the calendar year.
So we've increased the expectation by about $7.5 million.
The vast majority of that we got in the second quarter.
So there's a little bit left in the balance of the year but I think we - most of it is - we booked at this point.
On the 2016 outlook Colby I'd sort of reiterate something Jay said earlier but I think it's good for all of us on this call to be reminded.
You know if we saw a 20% or 25% step in the market next year and that's a big if not suggesting that's there but I think that directionally a question that's $25 million of run rate exit the year or $12.5 million with the midyear convention that go into the numbers.
So that's something just under 1% change in AFFO per share growth rate.
So I think it's important that we work hard for every percent around here.
And so if it's 6% to 7% that's been off our long-term forecast for you.
If the market were up 20% to 25% in a year into the second year you'd see something just over a 1% increase above plan in AFFO.
At the same time that really demonstrates the resiliency of the model which is kind of the comments we're making about the dividend yield as we sort of concluded my remarks.
I mean you'd be hard-pressed to find a business that frankly has less volatility with more utility for these assets your need for these assets over time and you've got the dividend yield which is obviously made up of contracted revenue.
You've got escalators that result in about half of the growth that we're forecasting.
And then we work hard every day on that additional 200 300 400 basis points of growth above that escalator.
And it's frankly one of the great attributes about this business model is how insensitive it is to changes in this market.
And no specific color I guess on increased activity potentially from either AT&amp;T or Sprint at this point? I'm not going to let you talk us up here in June or July whatever it is.
Right.
Fair enough.
Thank you.
All right.
Good luck.
We'll move next to Jonathan Schildkraut at Evercore ISI.
Good morning.
Thanks for taking the questions.
Two if I may.
First I noticed that the payout as a percent of AFFO stepped up a little bit in the quarter.
And even as I look at say the first half of the year free cash flow relative to dividends it looks like dividend payments were a little higher than free cash flow.
So I guess the question here is is the step-up in AFFO payout sort of in the free cash flow relative to dividend somewhat misleading due to timing but also the fact that you're putting out capital and then getting reimbursed from the carriers? And then I like to follow up with a second question please.
Yeah.
On the first question Jonathan I think it's just the - honestly the timing and the discontinued ops treatment between the sale of Australia and the purchase of Sunesys.
So at this point all of our historical results we'd removed Australia from adjusted EBITDA and AFFO as you're pointing out the payout ratio.
As we noted in our remark Sunesys is the complete push to Australia on an AFFO per share contribution.
So if you were to just factor in Sunesys and the way you - I think you were articulating doing the math.
I think if you pro forma Sunesys as though we owned it for all of 2015 then our payout ratio would look the same as it did previously.
I think in and around that payout ratio it's probably where we're going to manage the business.
The way we've articulated that most often to people when asked about our dividend policy it's to indicate that we would expect to match the growth in AFFO per share with growth in dividend per share.
So in our long-term target of trying to grow AFFO per share of 6% to 7% annually we would target growing the dividend at 6% to 7% organically over the longer term.
So I think that's the short answer to it.
You'll see that payout ratio would be back in line once we close Sunesys would be our expectation.
Great.
And then I found it really helpful that you guys provided 14 numbers stripping out CCAL.
We can sort of see what the growth rate of the remaining business is.
As we come back and we layer in Sunesys whenever that closes and you give us a little bit more detail I'm just trying to understand if we're going to have a real sense as to what happened from the business from 2015 to 2016 if Sunesys gets rolled in given that you've stripped out sort of the CCAL from 2015 now.
It's an asset reallocation and so understanding what you've done with sort of the capital you've been allocated as we move into 2016 and beyond.
It might be helpful to have a sense as to the contribution of the business at least in terms of what you owned it in the second quarter was from CCAL any thoughts? Yeah.
Jonathan I appreciate the feedback.
Obviously it's a great story on small cells and if we close that acquisition we'll be able to help folks understand our numbers and our guidance for the full-year and what we expect the contribution is from the asset once we close and the impact to guidance and try to do it in a similar vein as we try to do our overall disclosure of helping folks understand the business.
And one of the reasons why we talked about a longer-term target of AFFO per share growth rate is our aim is for those who are invested in our company to have the same view of growth and the future prospects of the business that we as a management team do.
So our aim in all those disclosure matters is to try to help make the business as clear as we possibly can.
We're always open to feedback on that.
So we'll take that away.
I appreciate the thoughts on it.
All right.
Thanks so much for taking the questions.
Thanks Jon.
We'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays.
Thank you very much.
I wanted to follow up on one of the prior questions about carrier strategies around small cells.
And it does seem as though there's a lot of interest and activity around sort of the co-location opportunities that you folks are putting forward.
But also are there other initiatives in place in which the carriers are going to wholly own their own small cell deployments and architectures whereby they may not completely embrace the co-location based business model? And then I've got a follow-up from that side.
Absolutely.
You know it's just like with the tower side.
It was only this year that Verizon decided to sell their towers the second time.
So I think it's because of the need for capacity in these markets you're going to see carriers work on self-performing to a degree just like they've done on the tower side where in various markets they may be able to access vendor relationships or their own capability to supplement what we as an industry will bring to them.
So I think it's both Amir.
I don't think it's going to be wholly third-party infrastructure-led.
And I think that's fine.
I mean again it's a big world out there.
And it makes sense in terms of speed to market where you've already got fiber to work on that.
And that was sort of the nature of our Sunesys interest and NextG three years ago was when you have fiber in a market that's been purpose-built for small cell deployments you can get on the air quicker.
And that's a key determinant on whether you get the business or not.
And somebody that has to start from scratch doesn't really have a competitive advantage.
And that brings in the potential for the carrier to work on it themselves.
So I think it's going to be both.
That's very helpful Ben.
And then in talking about sort of the current demand environment you had mentioned that the leasing activity that you had seen has been fairly healthy out of Verizon and T-Mobile.
If we start to think about sort of the opportunity set over the next 12 to 24 months I mean is there a potential that they are satiated with their current build requirements and sort of tempered back or do you see the introduction of new spectrum AWS-3 or anything along those lines as continuing to support the healthy demand environment that you've seen out of those carriers? We have a very strong view that we're going to continue to see a healthy demand of that environment based upon the different products and services that we as consumers are going to be utilizing going forward.
And I think the biggest driver of that as I mentioned in my remarks is around video and ultimately live television content.
I think that's a huge driver for our business going forward that we just frankly today can't really begin to quantify for you.
Just sitting here 10 years ago we wouldn't have been able to quantify sort of the broadband Internet adoption that we're now seeing.
So I think it's a long runway of growth.
Again in our business we don't so much look for inflection points as we look for extended runways.
And I have a very strong view about an extended runway which is how we got comfortable with sort of giving you a five-year outlook at 6% to 7% which I would mention remember 2015 with the headwind of churn being the highest of all the years is going to be a lot more like 5%.
So in order to say 6% to 7% over five years obviously it has to step at some point.
And we've given you a little bit of that view towards 2016 and we'll probably leave it at that.
Thank you very much for the incremental color.
We'll go next to Michael Bowen of Pacific Crest.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
A couple of things here.
With regard to the organic growth I think you've said last quarter that 50% was from the existing book of business.
I want to find out if that was still the same.
And then secondly with regard to the small cell business how do you think about that in relation to the AFFO per share organic growth that you talked about of 6% to 7%? In other words as you layer that in what should we think about as far as incremental organic growth from that business? Thanks.
I think on your first question the vast majority of the revenue growth that we're seeing in the business is being driven by brand-new leases on existing towers as well as the small cell revenue.
We're seeing a minimal benefit from amendment to existing site.
So currently most of it is being driven by new leases and that's driving the organic growth that the revenue line and then obviously flowing down to the AFFO line.
In the second part of the question I think the way I broadly answer the question is as we make investments in the case of the Sunesys acquisition of about $1 billion that acquisition we think has lots of opportunities for growth to the long-term which we've articulated on this call.
When you get down to that as the contribution to the growth on that 6% to 7% it represents a relatively small percentage of the overall enterprise value.
So we think it's additive.
But it's additive in terms of basis points and not multi-percentage points to that 6% to 7%.
So one of the ways that we've thought about is it probably gives us a greater confidence that we have the opportunities to achieve the higher end of our target of 6% to 7% but didn't necessarily cause us to reevaluate our 6% to 7% target.
And frankly as we look at the opportunities that we have in front of us I'm not sure that there are lot of things that we would say from an investment standpoint would be of a size that would cause us to reconsider that overall target.
Most of what we're working on is investing the excess cash flow that we have and opportunities that we see in front of us that makes sense.
And we think continue to increase dividends over time.
And then lease up the assets that we already own whether that's towers or small cells Okay.
That's helpful.
And then I guess lastly with regard to that AFFO per share organic long-term target should we assume that that's with the - relatively static share account or have you made any assumptions that are maybe in the - under the covers there.
Thanks.
Well I think the way I would answer that question is obviously anytime we look at the opportunity to invest in something it may require that we utilize some amount of equity in order to accomplish that.
But to the extent that we were to utilize equity or even debt or cash flow it's only because we think the investment warrants it.
It has to increase our overall growth rate and it has to be additive to our ability to pay dividends over the long term as measured by what's the growth in AFFO per share.
So I'm not going to presume today that we either need or don't need to utilize equity or debt to make growth opportunities.
We'll have to look at them as they come and evaluate what we think the growth prospects of those individual transactions are against the cost of the capital.
I would also point out over a long period of time we've been very diligent about reducing share count.
And so I certainly would not presume today that the opportunity over the next decade may - would not be our opportunity to reduce shares not just to issue shares.
So we may enter an environment where the best opportunity and the best investment of capital for us both using cash flow and potentially debt might be reducing our share count.
And I certainly wouldn't close off that opportunity.
We're trying to focus on maximizing AFFO per share and maximizing dividends per share over the long term or whether that results in asset acquisitions or the reduction of shares to share purchases I think we'll try to be smart about what that is and maximize the long-term returns for shareholders.
Okay.
Now I would just point out that as you get to that 5 times target and if we're successful in attracting the rating that we hope on the investment grade side just to add to the Fitch Rating this quarter at that point then your ability to then re-lever EBITDA resumes like we've had for years that happens to be a 5 multiple as Jay outlined in his remarks well then you're able to reliever EBITDA at 5 times every year which adds significant capacity once you achieve that level.
All right.
Very helpful.
Thanks for taking the questions.
We'll go next to Batya Levi at UBS.
Thanks.
Couple of follow-ups.
First on - as AT&amp;T and Verizon especially Verizon begin to reform some of its 850 spectrum for LTE build-outs in early 2016 do you think that kind of activity provides upside to the current trend or will it be enough to just sustain the level? And another question on the small cells I think you've mentioned 2 300 nodes on the pipeline.
How quickly that they will be generating revenues? Thank you.
Yeah.
Sure.
The AT&amp;T - I mean sorry the Verizon amendment activity as you suggested I would say that's broadly sort of baked in our view.
They're a very very steady and consistent disciplined investor in their network.
And as they've talked about on their call the reforming of the spectrum is sort of an ongoing way to maximize the efficiency of their investment in spectrum and that's sort of implicit in our views without being - I'm not sure we're ever 100% accurate - I'm certain we're not - on exactly by carrier the nature of the revenue growth we get every year.
We do our best to target it in the fall of the prior year.
And then we do our best to see how well we predict that outcome.
But it's implicit.
I wouldn't say that it's additive.
On your second question typically small cell deployments are taking us about 18 months roughly from the time we're awarded to building them 18 to 24 months.
Some portion of that pipeline would represent co-locations on existing systems and that timeline would be much lower than the 18 to 24 months to build it out.
And then the other thing I would point out to you as we've mentioned in prior quarters that pipeline is not a static number.
So we're constantly pursuing other opportunities given the returns that we're seeing in that business.
And so as much as we're completing projects that have been in the pipeline for 18 to 24 months we're filling back up the pipeline with new opportunities that will be building over the next couple of years.
Okay.
Thank you.
We'll go next to Spencer Kurn at New Street Research.
Hey.
Thanks for taking my question.
Just to follow up on Sunesys you've identified 3 500 opportunities for small cells on the asset.
Can you just provide a bit of context around what that means for the overall lease-up potential you see there and also how much revenue can you drive off of those opportunities? Thanks.
Yeah.
Those are opportunities that we've identified in our pipeline as opportunities to add nodes to their existing network fiber.
The timeline for that again I would go back to my prior comment around 18 to 24 months to bring those online once we start working on them.
The revenue contribution that we see from nodes is about a third of what we would typically see from a tower tenant.
So if you thought about the 3 300 nodes those would look like in the neighborhood of about 1 000 new tenants on towers.
And each tenant on a tower is in the neighborhood of about $24 000 to $30 000 on an annual basis in terms of rent.
So the contribution there probably in the neighborhood - somewhere in the neighborhood of $24 million to $30 million on the revenue line as we build up those nodes.
We obviously expect that pipeline to build as we integrate the asset and create more opportunity but it was obviously helpful as we thought about going into the acquisition on a yield of about 6% roughly day one and then having visibility to what equates to another couple 100 percentage points of yield - basis points of yield as we thought about the asset being able to specifically identify nodes that we thought we're going to end up on that fiber.
Great.
Thank you.
And we'll go next to Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital Markets.
Welcome back Jonathan.
So AWS-3 I just wondered what your - what's the plausible outcome in terms of when that might start to drive some amended revenues? And in your case you've got some MOAs and it looked like some of your sale leaseback deals and I wondered whether that perhaps a new tier growth opportunity from AWS-3 but in terms of physical deployment at the site are there going to be RRUs and is that going to happen second half of next year or first half of next year? What's your sense of that? Jon my sense is you're going to start seeing it second half of next broadly and it will depend on the portfolio and the configuration whether it was a legacy Crown Tower or whether it was newly acquired.
And then at the individual site level what the capacity - what's currently on the side against the reserve capacity.
So it's very hard to give you an exact number but I would tell you that across even the AT&amp;T portfolio we're already seeing additional revenue as we highlighted on this call before.
We're already seeing additional revenue on many of those installations as they upgrade through the reserve capacity.
So again long-term implicit in our view on growth over time but I can't really be a lot more specific than that.
Thank you.
You bet.
And with that I appreciate it and recycling Jon Atkins's background to the beginning I think we've covered all the bases covered the waterfront this morning with an 1 hour and 15 minutes.
I appreciate everyone's attention.
We are going to work hard on delivering the second half of the year like we have the first half.
Excited to welcome our Sunesys friends onboard here shortly and I will talk to you on the next quarter call.
Thank you.
And that does conclude today's conference.
Again thank you for your participation.

With that I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</strong> Thanks Son and good morning everyone.
As you can see from our third quarter results we continue to execute at a consistently high level exceeding the high end of our previously provided third quarter outlook which allowed us to raise the outlook for the full year.
At the midpoint our updated full year 2015 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.30 is up 8% compared to 2014.
Similarly for 2016 we are also expecting to deliver 8% growth in AFFO per share up from $4.30 per share in 2015 to $4.66 per share in 2016.
Further our board has approved a dividend increase in line with our expected growth in 2016 AFFO per share increasing the quarterly dividend by 8% from $3.28 per share to $3.54 per share on an annualized basis.
The increase in our common stock dividend reflects our commitment to delivering attractive long-term total returns for our shareholders by growing the dividend over time.
The strength of our business model quality of our portfolio and cash flows and our strong balance sheet give us the confidence to commit to returning a significant portion of capital to shareholders in the form of a dividend and at the same time maintaining the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities that we believe will enhance long-term growth in AFFO and dividends per share.
Turning to third quarter results on slide 4 site rental revenue grew 7% year-over-year from $718 million to $765 million an increase of $47 million.
The $47 million increase is comprised of $16 million from the Sunesys acquisition which closed during the quarter and $43 million of organic rental revenue growth net of $12 million in straight-line and other adjustments.
The organic site rental revenue growth of $43 million represents growth of 6% year-over-year comprised of approximately 10% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations net of approximately 4% from tenant non-renewals.
Moving to slide 5 our third quarter results for site rental revenue gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the high end of our previously provided third quarter 2015 outlook which did not include the Sunesys acquisition.
Even after stripping out the contribution from Sunesys which contributed $11 million in site rental gross margin during the quarter we would have exceeded the high end of our outlook.
Turning to investment activities as shown on slide 6 during the third quarter we invested $237 million in capital expenditures.
These capital expenditures included $31 million in sustaining capital expenditures and $16 million in land purchases.
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we look to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time.
Today nearly 40% of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own and approximately three-quarters on land we own or lease for more than 20 years.
Where we have ground leases the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years.
Additional information regarding the land beneath our towers is available in our Supplemental Information package posted in the Investors section of our website.
Of the remaining capital expenditures we invested $190 million in revenue-generating capital expenditures consisting of $92 million on existing sites and $98 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell construction activity.
As previously mentioned during the quarter we also closed on the Sunesys acquisition.
Sunesys owns or has the rights to nearly 10 000 miles of fiber in major metro markets across the U.S.
where we already have a small cell presence today and would expect to see meaningful amount of small cell activity in the future.
Prior to the Sunesys acquisition we owned or had rights to approximately 7 000 miles of fiber that supported 15 000 small cell nodes and growing.
The addition of Sunesys' well located high-quality fiber footprint more than doubles our fiber footprint available to support our small cell networks.
Year-to-date excluding Sunesys small cell site rental revenue has grown approximately 30%.
While towers will continue to be the most efficient and cost-effective way for carriers to deploy their networks we expect carriers to make investments in small cells to enhance their macro network by bringing cell sites closer to mobile subscribers supplementing wireless coverage and capacity provided by a tower at a height of 100 to 150 feet that covers an eighth to a half a mile with small cells deployed at a height of 20 to 30 feet on a traffic light that may cover a city block.
We believe small cells represent the natural progression of network densification and cell splitting by the carriers as they contend with consumer demand for mobile data.
Shifting to financing activities during the quarter we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per share or $274 million in aggregate.
Further we continue to maintain our long-term target leverage ratio of four to five times as we remain focused on achieving an investment-grade credit rating.
Moving on to full year 2015 outlook on slide 7 we have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues adjusted EBITDA and AFFO – $60 million $37 million and $23 million respectively.
On a per-share basis our updated 2015 outlook provides for AFFO per share growth of 8% year-over-year compared to 2014 increasing from $3.97 per share to $4.30 per share.
The increase in our 2015 outlook includes contribution from Sunesys of $40 million in site rental revenues and $30 million in site rental gross margin.
The increase in the outlook also reflects the strong results from the third quarter an increase in our expectations for leasing activity for the remainder of the year and our expectations that a portion of tenant non-renewal previously expected to occur in 2015 will take place in 2016.
It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant non-renewals in aggregate remained unchanged.
For 2016 at the midpoint of our outlook we expect AFFO per share growth of 8% driven by the continued strength in leasing activity the contribution of the Sunesys acquisition and improving operating leverage in our business.
On a normalized basis adjusting for Australia and Sunesys AFFO growth in 2016 would be between 6.5% and 7% or towards the high end of our long-term AFFO growth target.
Moving from left to right on slide 8 our expectations for growth of approximately $150 million in site rental revenues is comprised of new leasing activity or incremental revenue from new tenant installations and amendments to existing tenant leases of approximately $170 million consisting of tower leasing of approximately $115 million and small cell leasing of approximately $55 million.
The approximately $115 million in new leasing contribution from tower leasing is consistent with our long-term expectation of adding approximately one tenant-equivalent over 10 years across our portfolio of approximately 40 000 towers or a tenth of a tenant per tower per year.
To put that tenth of a tenant into perspective over the last six years our annual leasing activity has ranged between 0.09 and 0.13 tenants per tower.
Our organic growth is also supported by annual contracted tenant escalators on our towers and small cell leases of approximately 3% which we expect will contribute approximately $95 million in growth during 2016.
Growth from new leasing activity and tenant escalation is expected to be offset by tenant non-renewals of approximately $105 million to arrive at organic site rental revenue growth of $160 million or 6% growth year-over-year.
As we've previously disclosed the expectations for tenant non-renewals during 2016 is higher than our historical 1% to 2% annual non-renewal rate due to elevated non-renewals from the decommissioning of a portion of the Leap Metro and Clearwire networks.
Site rental revenue growth during 2016 also benefits from year-over-year incremental contribution from the Sunesys acquisition of approximately $60 million.
More detailed information regarding our current book of contracted tenant leases including the impact of straight-line accounting and expectations for non-renewals is available in our Supplemental Information package.
Turning to slide 9 I want to spend a moment to walk you through the approximately $130 million of growth in AFFO from 2015 to 2016.
Starting on the left-hand side we have organic site rental revenue growth of approximately $160 million offset by $35 million increase in normal ongoing operating and G&amp;A expenses.
The $35 million increase in expenses compared to the $160 million in organic site rental revenue growth drives incremental margins of approximately 80% illustrating the improving operating leverage in our business.
For 2016 our expectations for network services gross margin is $230 million to $250 million compared to our 2015 expectations of $280 million to $285 million.
The decline in network services gross margin of approximately $40 million is attributable primarily to equipment decommissioning fees generated in 2015 which we do not expect to occur in 2016.
Additionally 2016 AFFO growth benefits from a reduction in sustaining CapEx of approximately $25 million and other adjustments of approximately $20 million which includes the incremental contribution from Sunesys.
The approximately $130 million in expected growth in AFFO translates to approximately 8% growth in AFFO per share.
As Ben will discuss we continue to believe that our commitment to returning capital to shareholders with a particular focus on delivering high-quality dividend stream and disciplined capital allocation focused on long-term high-quality growth will drive significant shareholder value over time.
And with that I'll turn the call over to Benjamin.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong> Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning.
As you heard from Jay's remarks based on our increased 2015 outlook we expect to finish 2015 on a strong note and we look to continue this momentum moving into 2016.
Consistent with the goal we communicated a year ago to deliver 6% to 7% annual AFFO per share growth organically our 2016 outlook for AFFO per share provides for 8% growth at the midpoint inclusive of about 150 basis points of benefit from the sale of our Australian subsidiary and acquisition of Sunesys.
A year ago we also stated our intention to deliver dividend growth in line with our expected growth in AFFO per share and I'm pleased to announce that our board has approved an 8% increase in our stock dividend from $3.28 to $3.54 on an annualized basis.
Since we increased our dividend payout a year ago we have closed the yield differential between the RMZ REIT Index by 50 basis points outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and RMZ year-to-date and made good progress attracting the incremental long-term investor.
With the latest dividend increase we are continuing to build on our track record of delivering attractive total returns to shareholders.
From 2015 to 2016 our total return expectations are 12% comprised of the current 4% dividend yield and 8% growth in dividend.
Looking out beyond 2016 we remain confident in our long-term goal of generating 6% to 7% AFFO growth organically.
Combined with the current dividend yield of 4% we believe the long-term total return opportunity of 10% to 11% should be very compelling to investors given the contracted nature of our business.
In fact we believe a significant catalyst exists as we continue to deliver on expectations and differentiate Crown Castle from its peers in terms of capital allocation and strategic profile.
Compared to the best-in-class REITs with dividend yields in the high 2%s to low 3% range our dividend yield north of 4% suggests we have an opportunity to help investors appreciate the unique combination of high-quality yield and growth that we represent as an investment.
Further out of 425 dividend-paying companies in the S&amp;P 500 Crown Castle has the 383rd highest dividend yield putting us in the bottom 10 percentile of dividend payers.
While it's up to the market and investors to ultimately determine valuation I believe there are several compelling points to the Crown Castle story that make the case for a lower dividend yield and with it a higher valuation.
First is the quality of our business model and long-term positive industry tailwinds.
As has been true since the early days of the wireless industry network quality continues to be the market differentiator for carrier success driving continued long-term investments by the carriers.
As such we believe we are in a multi-year densification cycle that continuously requires all four major U.S.
wireless carriers to make significant investments to improve and enhance their networks in order to meet consumer demand for mobile broadband in order to remain competitive.
It's also clear that as network capacity and speed increases new applications and services such as mobile video the connected car and more broadly the Internet of Things are developed the promising new avenues for carriers to monetize their network investments.
Our results to date and our expectations for the balance of 2015 and 2016 further reinforce our view and demonstrate how well positioned we believe we are to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us.
For some context and highlighting the opportunity the carriers have in front of them the growth in mobile data traffic in the U.S.
from 2016 to 2017 is expected to equal all the mobile data traffic that was carried on cellular networks in 2014.
Mobile data is expected to double every two years through 2019 the furthest date that Cisco forecasts.
In fact earlier this week on Verizon's earnings call they mentioned they've seen a 75% growth year-over-year in mobile data usage across their subscribers.
As a shared wireless infrastructure provider we benefit from growing demand for mobile broadband as carriers access our infrastructure to provide service for their subscribers.
Underlying the shared infrastructure model is our ability to generate returns by leveraging our fixed investment and operating expenses over multiple tenants with each tenant benefiting from the capital-efficient model we present.
In turn our value proposition to the carriers is that we provide them with the quickest and most cost-effective access to infrastructure and real estate as they deploy and upgrade their networks.
As a case in point we were encouraged by the roadmap that FirstNet has established to seek industry partners in a public-private partnership to facilitate a nationwide public safety network deployment potentially in 2017.
Although still very early we believe our shared infrastructure portfolio will play a meaningful role in the efficient deployment of this network.
This brings me to my second point.
We believe that the portfolio we have built and invested in over the last 20 years uniquely positions us to play a critical role in helping carriers with their network needs.
In particular over the last several years we have focused our investments in the U.S.
with the acquisitions of T-Mobile and AT&amp;T towers and continued investments in the small cell business based on the thesis that there is a long runway of investments that need to be made in the U.S.
by wireless carriers and a consumer base that will support it.
Today our portfolio of approximately 40 000 towers and 15 000 small cell nodes supported by 16 000 miles of fiber makes us the only company that can deliver at scale and provide comprehensive wireless solutions across the U.S.
for carriers.
Our towers are well located with three-quarters of our portfolio in the top 100 markets and have a long runway for additional organic growth with only two tenants per tower on average suggesting a significant amount of leasing opportunity is yet to come.
On the small cell front we are capitalizing on our leadership position to secure some of the best assets where we believe there will be a long-term franchise value that will drive future co-location upgrade and co-location opportunities similar to the early days of the tower industry 20 years ago.
With small cells we believe we are skating to where the puck is headed as the theme of network densification continues into the future and in so doing extend our runway of growth and further reinforcing our leadership position in U.S.
wireless infrastructure.
Together the strength of our business model and the quality of our assets translates into a growing high-quality long-term recurring cash flow stream.
Today our average tenant lease term is about seven years and is backed by committed contractual lease payments of $20 billion which provides stable and predictable contracted cash flows supporting our dividend payout.
As we look to grow the dividend in the future we benefit from contracted tenant lease escalators which provide half of our stated goal of organic 6% to 7% growth in AFFO per share.
As it relates to the other half given the need for continued investments by our carriers – customers and the quality of our portfolio we believe that we can achieve our stated goal of growth through leasing on our portfolio of towers and small cells.
Said another way including the dividend approximately three quarters of our expected total return goal in already contracted in any given year.
Quality of our cash flows is further highlighted by the focus in the U.S.
where we benefit from what we believe is an attractive operating and investing environment that has a degree of visibility and long runway of growth without foreign currency exposure that can impact returns.
Our goal as a management team is to provide our investors with the most compelling risk-adjusted long-term total shareholder returns as measured by dividend growth over time.
To close we are very pleased to be in a position to raise our outlook and dividend by 8% as we approach 2016 which reflects the quality of our assets the expertise of our team and positive fundamentals of the U.S.
wireless industry from which we benefit.
And with that operator I'd be happy to turn the call over to questions.
Thank you.
And we'll go ahead and take our first question from David Barden with Bank of America.
Hey guys.
Good morning.
Thanks.
Nice results out this morning.
I would say that the big conversation that we were having last night after the print was really trying to think about next year's growth.
So in the first quarter to the second quarter we saw about $6 million of sequential site leasing and management revenue.
In the third quarter backing out Sunesys it was probably $12 million.
In the fourth quarter backing out Sunesys again the implication is you're looking for $8 million.
And then if I annualize the fourth quarter and look at 2016 the implication is that you're only going to be getting $4 million of incremental revenue to get to the midpoint of the future guidance.
And so I don't think people think that the industry is slowing down.
But if you could kind of help us figure out how we get from still robust growth to what appears to be a rapidly decelerating sequential revenue growth guide it would be super helpful.
And then just the second question would be – and maybe it's related is relative to 2015 it looks like the straight-line revenue is coming down a lot.
And if you could kind of address what contracts or kind of what is the driver of that function it'd be great.
Thanks so much.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Sure Dave.
On the first question anytime I think you go quarterly sequential changes in revenue particularly in the periods where we've had the disposition of Australia and then as you think about us rolling into Sunesys that may be a little distracting to look at it quarter-to-quarter on that.
I would point you to full year.
And our underlying assumption in terms of tenant activity as I mentioned in my comments is right around the tenth of a tenant that we would expect to add in 2016.
We're expecting basically that same level of leasing activity in 2015.
And one of the ways that you could point to it outside of talking about it in terms of tenant adds per tower is our underlying assumption is that on the tower side we'll have about $115 million of tower leasing growth from 2015 to 2016 and virtually that same number from 2014 to 2015.
So the assumption we're giving you here for the outlook in 2016 driving the top line number our view is that we're basically holding that assumption the same in 2015 and 2016 and would expect the year to kind of play out that way based on the total activity we can see to date.
In the second question the straight-line revenue number that you see decreasing in essence what you see is the non-cash portion of that straight line revenue decreasing.
And the reason for that is the annual cash escalator that's embedded in our leases.
And so we would expect that number to continue to decrease and you can roughly approximate that number by taking our adjusted organic site rental revenue and then looking at the escalator of roughly about 3%.
And absent any changes and obviously there's always changes because we're assuming additional revenue adds next year but absent those changes that number's going to go down by the equivalent of about 3% on an annual basis.
So straight-line's decreasing in essence because of the cash escalator that we have embedded in those leases.
We would expect that number to continue to decrease to about 2017 2018 at which point we would expect cash revenue received from tenants to actually exceed our GAAP revenue.
So I think the trend line that you're seeing in that is something that we would expect to continue for the foreseeable future.
And Jay if I could just follow-up real quick.
Obviously we started out this year pretty soft and we've been seeing in your – as you kind of waterfall the numbers for us it's been about 5.3% and then 5.9% and now in this quarter 6.4% organic site leasing revenue growth and yet you're still next year guiding to kind of the same absolute dollar number of revenue irrespective of the fact that the revenue growth has been accelerating this year.
Are you trying to point to some specific deceleration in one of the growth drivers that's been leading to the accelerating revenue year-to-date or is this just trying to be conservative? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> I think Dave as we went into calendar year 2015 our working assumption was that tower revenue growth was going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about $90 million to $100 million of new leasing activity be that from brand new leases as well as amendments.
And as we've gone through the balance of 2015 we've actually increased that assumption by about 10% to 15% roughly to get to the $115 million of expectation.
And then we're going to hold that into our 2016 guide based on the activity that we would expect to continue from the carriers throughout 2016.
Thanks Jay.
And next we'll go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Good morning.
I'm just continuing on that theme about the 2016 guidance.
You were talking about the activity you've seen.
Clearly this year we had two carriers very active and two carriers pretty quiet.
Are you getting any sense that we can go to a more balanced environment in 2016 or is it just too early for you to actually bake that into your guidance? So could there be some upside as I guess say Sprint got some financing or AT&amp;T resumes their sort of normal level of capital spending? And then I do see you're suggesting services gross margin down $40 million and with some of that related to the decommissioning coming down.
How much of the $40 million is the decommissioning versus just another level – a lower level of activity being assumed going forward? Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
Hey Simon it's Ben.
I'll take you back a few years and for many of us on this call I think you remember this.
We used to really refrain from speaking with really any specificity around carrier deployment plans.
And over the last couple of years we've sort of relaxed that standard and probably spoken a little bit too much occasionally around specific carrier deployment plans.
And as a result I've been asked by a few of our friends and customers if we would refrain from talking about their specific plans and let them do their own talking about their deployment plans.
And I think that's a perfectly reasonable request and frankly a pretty good reminder of the way we used to do things.
So unfortunately the way I'm going to answer your question you may not be completely satisfied with but when we give you the $115 million of tower rental growth – again consistent to 2015 – that takes into account everything that we expect to see out of the combination of all four carriers as we know it as we sit here in late October of the prior year.
And as you certainly note because you've modeled the company very thoroughly if we saw a tick-up inside the year next year from a particular carrier or two that would have a relatively small financial impact inside that year obviously being more impactful into 2017.
But all within the range of this sort of range that Jay gave you in his prepared remarks of kind of up or down 20% is sort of what we've seen back for the last seven years.
And that up or down 20% goes back to when all four carriers were building out LTE to a time when maybe they were a little bit slower.
And that up or down 20% would be about 1% change in AFFO per share growth.
So I think we've given you all the detail you need and particularly in the supplement we'll show you quarter-to-quarter changes in revenue from the carriers so you can certainly see it on a trailing basis sort of who's doing what.
But I'm really going to try to not really speak about specific terms of sort of who's doing what in the marketplace because it's certainly – a lot of that is proprietary information.
Okay.
But your basic message is you're currently modeling about a similar level of activity? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
The carriers ...
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> That is the absolute message is that we're modeling off of the activity we've seen in this year which is – as Jay suggested has ramped through the year and we are seeing application volume sort of ramp as we come in to the fourth quarter and that is all taken into account in our expectations.
And again we try to stay with whole numbers because you lose a few percentage points a few basis points on the larger base every year when you're just looking at percentages.
And then on your service gross margin question down $40 million yeah that's one-timers that occurred in 2015 around pay-and-walk fees and a few other things that we don't expect to repeat in 2016.
So importantly our sort of core service contribution in the 240 to 250 range is the core contribution we're seeing this year.
So we're looking at it to be comparable to 2015.
Great.
Thanks a lot.
And next we'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Hey guys.
Thanks.
Two things.
One to follow up on David's question and not any particular carrier but it seems like it's been about five years since you signed some of the MLAs that we've talked extensively about in the past.
Do any of those expire in 2016? And how should we think about the GAAP and cash impact as those roll off? And then second Ben can you follow up on your comments about FirstNet? And just expand on the opportunity here and how you see the architecture of shared versus proprietary network that they're planning? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Phil on your first question the structures that we had signed up with the carriers where they were committing to a certain level of leasing and going ahead and paying us for that in advance of actually putting equipment on the towers those have virtually completely been used up at this point.
So I think we talked about going into 2015 we were expecting somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10% of the activity in total on amendments that would have already been provided for and we're already being paid for in the structure of those agreements.
Today virtually every lease we have where the carriers are putting additional equipment on the tower is adding additional site rental revenue to the mix.
So we're really past that stage at this point.
And as we think about the 2016 activity we're not really factoring in any amendments that would not bring additional site rental revenue.
Got it.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Phil on your comment around FirstNet look I'm encouraged.
The webinar earlier – the webcast earlier a few days ago indicated for me a pretty clear road map of time lines and dates to launch a deployment here in the way that we've always felt like is the most efficient.
And from their point of view I think they've suggested that it will only consume about 5% of the spectral capacity of their spectrum on any given day and so that's a tremendous opportunity for the industry to use that remaining spectrum high-quality spectrum.
And as a result there's going to be a fairly complicated and yet unknown RFP process to go through exactly what will a carrier or a collection of carriers by market maybe splitting it out pay for it and what's it's worth to them? And that part is not clear and still very complicated and I think presents a fair amount of uncertainty still.
But I do believe they're on the right track of looking at a shared network that will likely be hosted across one or multiple carriers' networks which we certainly can accommodate and expect to participate in and use our infrastructure to do so in a very efficient way.
So I think in previous calls we basically said we don't have any clear direction.
I think we now have some clear direction about where they're headed and that's encouraging albeit it's probably not financially material into really into 2018 because if you're probably starting on deployments mid-2017 wouldn't have any real financial consequence probably until you get into 2018.
But we're encouraged.
Thanks guys.
Next we'll go to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.
Inc.</span></strong> Thanks guys.
One quick follow-up to Phil's.
Jay not just the MLAs but you guys mentioned how you bought T-Mobile towers and AT&amp;T towers.
I think there was some reserved space or future space in those deals as well.
So MLAs and M&amp;As you guys are pretty much through any free space if you will? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> That's correct Ric.
My answer would apply to both situations.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
And then I want to dig a little deeper on Sunesys and small cells if I could so I apologize for going a little deeper dive.
On Sunesys I think you were guiding to about $75 million in gross margins and $60 million or so in EBITDA after G&amp;A.
When the deal was announced you thought the first year of Sunesys gross margins might be more $80 million to $85 million and EBITDA might be more $60 million to $65 million.
So what has happened in Sunesys given that we closed the deal early and a little lower number for calendar 2016? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Yeah Ric it just has to do with the way they classified direct operating expenses and G&amp;A as compared to the way we would do it.
So when we got in and started to figure out how we would reflect the results of the business we did it consistent with the way we would look at towers and reflected some of those expenses in different categories.
So the net number is unchanged.
We just – we moved some of the expenses from direct operating expenses and G&amp;A in order to match the way we think about it on the tower side to be consistent.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And you've mentioned where you hoped that there's some meaningful ability to get small cells on top of it? It looks like the guidance is still kind of business as usual at Sunesys as far as their legacy.
Have you assumed any small cell extra growth onto that asset? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
So Ric the way we're thinking about the Sunesys asset today is really inventory and I'd be thrilled to come on the call in a couple of quarters and tell you that the activity has ramped beyond what we're seeing today but the way we think about it is we just bought inventory and it's a cost advantage and a speed advantage for deployment of the pipeline that we currently see and what we expect.
And so as we've said our expectation for small cell revenue growth is about $55 million next year consistent with what we've seen this year.
By implication you can say the pipeline looks steady.
If it were to grow from there then terrific and that's kind of what we are pursuing.
And we have a lot more inventory with which we can deploy small cells on again on a very cost-effective basis because we've essentially – we already own the asset and on an expedited basis because we don't have to build it.
But right now we're not guiding to an incremental increase in revenue contribution from there today.
Now your last question is around Sunesys specifically.
I would say having owned it a very short period of time there's a very modest amount of revenue growth within the Sunesys traditional business but that's not core and not something that we would spend a lot of time focusing on with you.
Inc.</span></strong> Makes sense.
And last question is when you look at the CapEx that you spent within the quarter I think it was about $98 million for new builds primarily all of it small cells should we think about still that old rule of thumb about $100 000 per node if it's a new node? We haven't seen a lot of change in the node count still 15 000 approximately last quarter and this quarter.
We're just trying to get our model correct as far as as you spend CapEx on the small cell when does it roll into being nodes on the air and the revenue coming in? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Yeah.
You're right about the $100 000 per node.
That's the best way to model the business and consistent with our expectation.
As we've reflected the nodes we've shown that number as a combination of nodes under construction and those on air and rounded it.
And so you haven't seen it move but that would just be inside of the rounding of 15 000.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And you know me I'd love to get some more segment details on small cell as far as revenues margins and actually some quantity.
So as you consider now it's 11% of the business pro forma hopefully someday we'll get some more details? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah Rick.
We're continuing to look at that and provided obviously some pretty meaningful detail in the slides that I talked about and then also in the supplement.
As we're going through the process of integrating Sunesys we're re-looking again at kind of our operating reporting relationships and the best way to operate the business and then the best way to reflect and review the results ourselves.
And that may result in us doing disclosures a little differently than what we've done historically.
But we are trying as much as we can to provide you the information you need to evaluate how well the business is operating.
Inc.</span></strong> We'll take just some decimal points too probably.
Anyway thanks guys.
Next we'll go to Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Hi thanks for taking the questions.
Two if I could.
First could you go back to the slide where you walk through different revenue drivers for 2016? And can you talk about how much of the internal growth in 2016 is generated by Sunesys versus the amount that you have in the external growth bucket? And then the second question I had just taking a step back on leverage can you talk a little bit about why you think it's so important to drive towards investment grade credit metrics and try to get an investment grade credit rating? And have you modeled the alternative if you didn't do that maybe what your leverage or AFFO growth per share might look like in the alternative? Thanks.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Yeah.
On your first question Mike when we talk about the $115 million in tower leasing and the $55 million in small cell leasing you should think about that as basically our legacy business prior to the acquisition of Sunesys.
And the benefit that we'll have in Sunesys is over in the acquisition category of roughly $60 million.
I assume you're referring to slide 8 in your question there.
So the way to think about that I think is pretty consistent with what we've done in 2015 similar assumptions in 2016.
On your second question around investment grade we have spent a lot of time working on that and run the exact analysis that you articulated between remaining non-investment-grade versus investment grade.
And I would say for a long period of time Ben and I have held the view that the value creation is driven in our business over the long term by three different areas.
One of those is obviously organic leasing on the assets that we already own.
Secondly by the way that we allocate capital; and today we're obviously allocating a meaningful portion of capital to what we believe to be growth-enhancing around small cells.
And then thirdly by reducing and taking actions that reduce the overall expected cost of equity in our business.
And there are a lot of aspects of that that have implications in terms of how we operate the business.
One of those which we've obviously spent the last several years talking a lot about is our focus on the U.S.
market and our unwillingness to go to emerging markets.
And as we think about the business that we're running it's a growing annuity of cash flow payments out of the various wireless carriers.
And underlying that is obviously the credit quality and stability and predictability of those cash flows coming from those wireless operators.
And our view is that over time as the story is better understood the understanding of that risk should necessarily reduce the overall cost of the equity.
Commensurate with that is having a balance sheet that regardless of market conditions has access – free access to the capital markets.
And we believe the investment grade credit rating as much as the rating is is an indication of how we manage the balance sheet.
So that in maybe less favorable times than we are currently in the capital markets we would maintain the access and there would never be a question about whether we would be able to pay the dividend if we were in a relatively choppy capital market.
So it's a combination of factors but we think it has implications longer term as we think about lowering the cost of the equity and driving long-term returns to shareholders.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I would just add one thing Mike if you will.
If you run out the model long term which we have staying levered like we used to it makes a very insignificant difference to the overall return and obviously increases the risk profile materially as Jay just walked through in times when markets are disrupted.
The other thing I would say though just more broadly about our business as we've all worked on this for a long time we have a fabulous business model around shared infrastructure where it's generally cheaper for a carrier to occupy one of our facilities and benefit from the capital efficiency of sharing than it is to do it themselves.
We can sort of get double benefit out of that to the extent our absolute cost of capital can be less than our carrier customers where you are less reliant on co-location over time to the extent you can demonstrate over time that your absolute cost of capital is less than the carrier customers because of the nature of our cash flow being long term contracted with escalators out of what we believe has always been the most senior secure cash flow stream coming out of the wireless industry which is that to operate their network.
So that's a long-term aspirational goal.
I wouldn't suggest to you we're there yet but it's something that we've had – we always take a long-term view.
And I think the next sort of generation of this business will be that we will have an absolute cost of capital including total return expectations on our equity that's lower than our customers'.
And that's a wonderful place if we can ever get there and that's what we're pursuing.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Thanks very much.
And we'll go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.
Hi thanks.
Just two quick follow-ups.
With regard to Sunesys you know how you're not really trying to grow the existing business but could you just remind us about the durability of those existing customer relationships meaning so you maybe continue to run rate that $100 million-plus of revenue? And then you noted that there's going to be about a $35 million increase in spending.
I was hoping we could get a little more detail on what's behind that.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Sure.
We think the revenues are very durable.
The growth rate there in escalations roughly is about 3% on an annual basis.
So we would expect to see some uplift there.
And then contracted terms is about five years.
So a little less than what we see on the tower side but still nonetheless pretty long term in nature.
And on the increase in spending you're expecting next year? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> You mean expense growth? Is that what you're asking? Yes the expense growth yes.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Yeah.
That's a little less than 3%.
If you look at total direct operating expenses and G&amp;A it's about 2.8% increase in expenses year-over-year excluding obviously what we're bringing on from Sunesys.
Is some of that related to the small cell business or is it just the normal inflation in costs? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Yeah normal inflation in costs.
We would see that across the business.
And I guess I will just ask one quick follow-up along that.
I mean how do you feel about the spending growth around the small cell business? You had noted previously that the spending was growing more rapidly than say the rest of your overhead expense as you were growing the business.
I mean at what point are we going to start to see that level off and maybe get a bit more operating leverage from the growth in your Dash revenues? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well Brett you're seeing that today which is kind of the point I made in my prepared remarks about the 80% incremental margins.
For the last several years as we were really building out the overall infrastructure for small cells as well as integrating the large tower acquisitions that we did we saw spending on increasing span of control and management level folks in addition to the more operating level jobs that we put in place in order to operate those assets and so our incremental margins came down from what we've seen historically.
As we think about 2016 though we think about it in a much more normalized basis as again from an operating cost standpoint that coming down much more in line with what we've seen historically in the business just under 3% and therefore the incremental margins that we see on the incremental revenue being put into the business is coming out at about 80%.
Okay.
Thanks for taking the questions.
Next we'll go to Colby Synesael with Cowen &amp; Company.
Great.
Two lines of questioning.
You mentioned I think in response to Simon that you're seeing some increase in application volume.
I was wondering if we could just kind of parse through that.
So is that fairly even across all four carriers? Are you seeing one or two carriers potentially carrying the torch there? Also -- but you don't have to tell us which ones! Also I was trying to get a sense amendments versus new sites.
And then also has that really been a steady ramp through 2015 or are you seeing some form of slight inflection? And then just the other line of questioning had to do with the acquired churn.
We saw in the supplemental that it's assumed to be up in 2016 and 2017 versus what you previously had last quarter.
Is that simply some of the pushout that you described or is there an actual absolute change in the acquired churn that you're now expecting? Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yes.
Hey Colby it's Ben.
Yeah the churn is no change in the total.
It's just sliding from 2015 to 2016 unfortunately and a little bit into 2017.
So obviously we'd rather get it done sooner than later but it moves a little bit.
And it was our best guess when we originally gave you that number.
And then in terms of activity I'll just sort of stick with what I said before.
Look we've got application volume up in the second half of this year.
I'm pleased to see what I'm looking at for fourth quarter.
But again I want to tell you that that's in our expectations for 2016.
So that $115 million we're giving you is our best view today of what we're looking at.
And again earlier on in the call even if we started to beat that number again 20% up would be technically about 0.5% in the first year and a full percent or a little more than a full percent in the second year.
So I really think it's a less than productive discussion to go down the path of who's doing kind of what to whom when we tell you that we've got it all in there and we'll tell you on a trailing basis exactly by quarter who's doing what in terms of total revenue so you can kind of see it.
And beyond that I'll really direct it back to our four carrier customers to talk about their specific deployment activity.
And just one follow-up to that.
Any color though on whether it's more amendments versus new sites? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Pretty similar in what we expect in 2016 to what we've seen in 2015.
And I think last quarter we talked about this a little bit and we talked about the fact that it's returned to a more normalized level where we're in a neighborhood of about 40% or so of amendments and about 60% from new leases.
I don't see anything really changing.
It obviously moves around a little bit quarter-to-quarter depending on what work we're working on for which carrier but somewhere in that neighborhood would be my working assumption for 2016.
Great.
Thank you.
And congrats on the quarter.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Thanks.
Next we'll go to Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Yes.
I was interested in the small cell leasing growth that you're expecting next year and is most of that going to continue to be anchor tenant growth or is there any signs of interests and hopes that you could get additional tenancies in the next couple of quarters on that infrastructure? And then more broadly talking about fiber assets I just wondered if there's an opportunity to modify unused fibers that you wouldn't need in the normal course of your small cell expansions? Thanks.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Jon on your first question the activity we're seeing today about 75% is related to new builds and I'm talking specifically to small cells.
About 75% is where we're building new systems and about 25% is lease-up on existing systems and that would be similar to our assumptions for 2016 that that rate will continue.
The other thing I would point to broadly is if we look at the level of lease-up activity and compare that to what we're seeing in towers we're seeing lease-up on small cells occur at a rate faster than that of towers today across all the small cell networks that we've built.
We're about a tenant and a half roughly across those existing systems.
And obviously we've not owned them or built them that long ago.
So making the comparison that I made earlier in the conversation in my prepared remarks about adding about 0.1 tenant per tower per year or one tenant over a 10-year basis we're ahead of that as you think about the tenancy adds.
The other way to think about it is how are we doing on a yield basis if you think about the annual recurring cash flow coming off of small cells compared to the total net capital that we put into them.
We're building systems as you've heard us talk about initial yield of about 6% to 7%.
And today the yields across the entire book of business considering all of the capital that we've spent including the amount of capital we just spent on the Sunesys acquisition that came in at about 6% initial yield the whole book of business is now at about 8.5% yield.
So we have meaningfully increased the yield on those assets and that's driven almost entirely by the additional lease-up that we've seen on those systems that we've built.
So obviously we're encouraged about how well the co-location has gone.
Some of you may have seen the system that we built in Philadelphia recently.
That system went on air it was a system that we've been working on for about a year or a year and a half or so.
It went on air in a densely populated area that got some recent press coverage went on air with three tenants on it day one.
Obviously that's not our underwriting assumption and it doesn't happen every time but we're starting to see more and more of the carriers want to co-locate and lease up these systems that are being built in phenomenal areas around the country.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> And then Jon on your comment about monetizing unused fiber.
That's absolutely something we're looking at.
We couldn't put that in guidance yet.
But in terms there's two ways to do that.
One would be to contract with third parties other providers who might want to use it as we did with Sunesys before we owned them.
Or alternatively the Sunesys sales force gets turned loose on our fiber that we own where we can add monetization through additional contracts on that fiber.
We're looking at both of those things.
We'll probably pursue them both as that's just prudent to get the return out of the investment.
I wouldn't say that's certainly not meaningful in the numbers as we look at and having owned it a couple of months but it's an opportunity for us nonetheless.
Not the core business and not why we did the transaction but it's revenue and margin none the same that I think we can go out and get.
Great.
Thanks very much.
Next we'll go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you very much.
And good morning folks.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Hey Amir Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Good morning.
Inc.</span></strong> I wanted to build upon the prior question in terms of co-location opportunities when it comes to small cells.
There has been some debate among some of the carriers in terms of the strategy at which they are going to deploy small cells at least some of the commentary that we've been hearing in terms of their strategy.
As you sit today it does sound like the opportunity set for a certain number of carriers seems to be improving.
How should we think about the longer term opportunity? Do you think that some of these technologies are viable over the longer term? Is there going to be a hybrid approach towards some of those small cell deployments whereby you'll still be able to capture your fair share of co-location opportunities? We'd love to hear your thoughts on that.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
Amir this is Ben.
I think we've already seen an evolution in some of the technologies with some carriers wanting a lit service what we would think of as a small-cell application versus a dark service – a full turnkey dark service which is a distributed antenna system sort of a switch which the majority of what we have today and still what we're still deploying today.
So think that will happen over time depending on what particular issue the carriers are trying to address in that location.
From where we look at it today though we're getting long-term contracts where we're starting with a very healthy initial yield as Jay just walked you through and co-location opportunities that are today tracking north ahead of where a traditional sort of tower acquisition would be and we're doing it in areas where as you've seen some of the maps 90% of the activity is in the top 25 markets in the U.S.
that we think are frankly beachfront real estate for purposes of these systems just like we did when we acquired tower portfolios 15 years ago.
So we think it's a terrific long-term objective but it's location-specific.
I mean there are places where carriers have needs where we've been a little sheepish about going honestly because they've been second- and third-tier markets where one particular carrier might have had a need but it's harder to underwrite when that second or third carrier would have a similar need.
And that's just like the tower business by the way.
So we're being pretty careful about where we deploy the capital.
And so far to move the needle as we've moved it as Jay just walked through on almost $3 billion of life-to-date capital spend in that business tracking at about an 8.5% yield today suggests we're on the right path.
It is still very early days.
We are going to have the capability – we already have the capability and I think we'll continue to enhance it to accommodate whatever level of architecture or technology the carrier wants to deploy.
And it's very clear that backhaul connected to fiber on net is the preferred approach to a durable system that provides sort of scalability in terms of backhaul.
And that's what we provide.
And so we're thrilled to death and going about as hard as we can go right now as we have said before.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you very much.
And if I may one follow-up question I know we've talked about technology disruption in the industry for some time now and there's always been percolating conversations around Wi-Fi dislocation and stuff along those lines.
Recent news suggests that there is someone of significant heft that may be looking to deploy a service over the near to midterm.
How do you think about that in terms of the reality of investment and potential disruption for your market if that was to come to fruition? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
I rely on our history honestly and I rely on our carrier customers' view of this topic which is we already have more than half of wireless traffic or data on Wi-Fi networks today and it's a very efficient offload strategy that we all benefit from as consumers.
And I think that the wireless carriers with licensed spectrum would have a very hard time supporting all of that if there wasn't an efficient offload strategy.
And I think that's going to continue.
Verizon talked about it on their call though.
They don't think that's necessarily the path for them going down with licensed spectrum to be able to control the network and the network quality.
But I think we as consumers have a view that when you jump off of your contracted carrier network and you get on Wi-Fi wherever you happen to be I don't think you have the same expectation of service.
And maybe that's a benefit ultimately to the carriers over time.
But in order to accommodate the growth in data services that we're all seeing and we see it in the press every single day with new applications and devices our view is that it's going to take all commerce.
It's going to take towers first and foremost that we again have a belief that we will have every tenant on every tower over the long term.
We think there's absolutely no reason – unless there's obviously a competing site which as you know is very rare in the tower business – that you wouldn't have all four carriers on every tower over time almost by definition.
Obviously we don't give you that in our 2016 guidance but that's our long-term thesis.
Behind that comes then the small cell architecture where as we've talked about it now for a couple of years the benefit of the small cell capacity offload is what it's essentially doing it's dealing with a hot spot where there's a capacity issue in an urban environment.
It's also unloading a macro site and making it more efficient.
We think it takes that in scale and we think there will be hundreds of thousands of nodes over time.
And then on top of that just to finish out your question absolutely agree there'll be Wi-Fi capability as there is today.
Perhaps we all as consumers will accept a lower threshold of service in a stationary environment not a mobile environment.
But we think it takes all of the above to accommodate the Internet the broadband Internet usage that we're all seeing in the connected devices and obviously mobile video.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you very much for taking the questions.
And next we'll go to Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Thanks guys.
Just a couple of follow-ups.
FirstNet do you think it can be material kind of the 120 basis points increase of revenue growth over time? And secondly on AT&amp;T it sounds like the reserve capacity got used up a little bit faster than you were expecting.
I think definitely faster than what the company was expecting.
And I just have one follow-up.
Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah Tim.
On the FirstNet revenue contribution I don't know how to model that yet.
It's just too early.
I don't know who is going to be the winner of the RFP and exactly what the economics are.
I think for purposes of your thinking certainly to the extent it's a discrete application on a tower that would look like a co-location.
And I think they've said upwards of 40 000 sites that they need.
We support that and look at what they're trying to accomplish it sounds reasonable to potentially a little bit low.
To the extent it's a shared application where they're going to co-locate it looks more like an amendment which we're certainly able to price and it would an efficient use of the structural capacity on the tower and be very quick to deploy.
But I can't – I don't want to sit here and tell you what that mix is going to be yet.
I just – there's no way to know at this stage.
And with respect to sort of where we are on AT&amp;T and that particular portfolio I think Jay's comments I'll just probably leave alone.
That's probably about as far as we ought to go.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Great.
And then on the small cell side are you seeing any new competitors coming in to that market or maybe just as you get more and more experience your thoughts on the barriers to entry? Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
As I've said before I think there will be more competitors over time.
It's an enormous market when you start thinking of geographies at the per-city-block level there's a lot a lot to get done.
And certainly we can't do it all and we see other competitors in the market and others that are gaining capabilities.
And I think that will happen over time.
We're getting long-term contracted terms to amortize the investment.
And in terms of the barriers to entry this is purpose-built fiber.
And particularly with what we're doing today it's a very high consumer of strands purpose-built back to a hub location.
It's not easily replicated.
And so we're very confident that once you get an installed base and it's serving the need of that particular carrier again on an efficient basis we think it's a very sticky business.
Not too worried about the long-term barriers to entry here.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Thank you.
And next we'll go to Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
I think most of my questions have been answered but maybe I'll hit this.
How do you think about – you mentioned Cisco continuing to talk about mobile data doubling each year through 2019.
As you think about how the carriers are going to try to handle that how do you guys go about modeling that into your assumptions going forward? I realized you're only giving out 2016 at this point but your thoughts on that would be helpful.
Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
You know Michael we sort of view this one year at a time.
I just gave you on the previous question kind of my long-term view on why we bought all these towers and why we think those are still the most attractive and efficient way for carriers to add capacity in a market and then as we've talked about pleased with what we're seeing on the small cell site as a complement to that.
I think it's very clear we all have underestimated probably forever what the demand would be on the wireless networks and then what we would need to provide as infrastructure.
What I look carefully at – and I think this is going to be interesting to watch and Verizon talked about it a little bit on their call – is opportunities to start monetizing the network in a different way than what we all traditionally would think of as sort of subscriber sort of monthly payments.
And so if you want to know kind of what we're watching that's interesting to us as they generate new revenue streams as a way to further monetize the network.
And I realize today that's financially immaterial but I think that that will ultimately drive the incremental investment in the networks that obviously we benefit from.
Then a one last one.
I think a few months ago you said in 2016 you're assuming a mix of about 40% amendments and 60% leases for 2016.
If I'm correct on that can you remind us what 2015 is and I believe you said that lease ups are up.
So should I assume if 2016 is increased at that 60% for leases over 2015 are you at a 70% run rate kind of as a catch-up right now? How can we think about that right now? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Yeah.
Michael the expectation for 2015 is honestly pretty similar to that of 2016 so it may move a few percentage points between new leases and amendments but I didn't mean to imply that we were seeing a big move in the type of applications or the type of activity.
Our assumption for 2016 is pretty similar both in terms of gross dollars as well as the mix.
Okay great.
Sorry I ran out of questions.
I figured I'd give it a shot.
Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> That's all right.
We're running past time for everybody sorry about that.
Trying to get everybody in.
Next we'll go to Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI.
Good morning.
Thanks for taking the questions.
Two if I may.
First on the leverage side I'm seeing that leverage ticked up a little bit quarter-over-quarter and maybe that's because we don't have a full quarter of Sunesys in here to reflect on the EBITDA that you've paid for.
But could you give us a little bit of perspective of how we get down to four to five times leverage over the next whatever period of time it's going to take? And then the second question I just want to circle back on sort of how we could think about revenue-generating CapEx as we go forward.
My bad I didn't do a good job of modeling that this quarter.
But would it be fair to maybe think about the $55 million of incremental small cell leasing you're going to get next year? I think Jay you said 75% of that is going to be sort of on new systems so take three quarters of that and then sort of gross it up based on your initial yields of 6% to 7%? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Yeah.
On your first question Jonathan – thanks for the questions.
On your first question around Sunesys you're right about how to do the leverage calculation.
It ticked up a little bit just because we did not have a full quarter of Sunesys in that calculation.
We would expect to get down to the four to five times over time through growth in EBITDA.
We're not making an assumption that we're going to allocate capital towards paying down debt but rather just growth in the business as we've laid out kind of our growth forecast.
So we think the main growth in the business is going to drive that leverage ratio down over time.
On the second question yes that is the right way to think about CapEx as you articulated.
We think it's going to be about the same as 2015.
And as you think about initial yields on invested capital that would play out real closely to our guide and flow through of the growth in revenues flowing down to the EBITDA line.
All right.
Thanks so much.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> You bet.
Next we'll go to Batya Levi with UBS.
Great thank you.
A couple of follow-ups.
Throughout this year you saw a delay in the renewal activity and it's pushed out to next year.
I was wondering if you are having any conversation with the carriers today to potentially capture that churn for next year in maybe new MLAs that you could sign with them.
And then a follow-up on the CapEx side can you talk about why maintenance CapEx is coming down next year and how should we think about maintenance CapEx for the macro sites versus small cells? Thank you.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
In terms of specific conversations around renewals and MLAs I'd tell you there's sort of nothing significant going on at the moment that merits commenting on and the churn forecast as we've laid out in the supplement is sort or our best estimate of kind of where that's going.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> On the second question around maintenance CapEx it's primarily coming down because we saw during 2015 a meaningful portion of that maintenance CapEx being associated with additional office facilities as we were increasing the employment base for integrating the various assets that we've acquired recently.
And so that's the reason for the reduction of about $25 million.
If you think about that reduction to where we're giving guidance for 2016 I would tell you about a third of that is corporate related roughly and then the remaining balance would be on revenue-generating both towers and small cells.
That's probably – as you think about modeling it long term though I would use 2016 as the run rate assumption and absent any meaningful acquisitions that we do that's probably a pretty good run rate for forecasting purposes.
Is the maintenance CapEx for small cells a bit higher than macro? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> &gt;: No it's actually a little bit lower.
If you were thinking about it as a percent of revenues which is probably the best way to think about it it would actually be a little bit lower.
Most of the maintenance if you think about maintenance would be in the direct operating expenses on the small cell side.
Got it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> &gt;: You bet.
Next we'll go to Matt Heinz with Stifel.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you.
Good morning.
So we certainly appreciated the opportunity to go into your Philly small cell network about a month ago and definitely thought that that was – the three-tenant network was kind of illustrative of the longer-term potential of the business.
But I was hoping you could just help us understand the competitive differentiation of your turnkey platform versus others in the market that may be more of just an on-net fiber oriented provider or just a pure service provider without the fiber? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah Matt.
And thanks for the comment on the Philly system.
We were quite pleased with that.
The majority of the work we're doing today is what we would call sort of full turnkey build out where we're building the nodes and the fiber as we talked about.
There are some of our carrier customers though in fact different by market depending on what their individual capabilities are in a particular market that are wanting to do some of that installation themselves and essentially just contract with us for the fiber on the same long-term contracted basis that we've talked about.
And we're okay with that.
I mean we're in business to monetize the investment and get a yield off co-location.
And we'll accommodate however they want to go through it.
We believe over time it will become more apparent that we have sort of unique expertise in what is continuing to be a challenging implementation and construction environment.
It's not easy to do this stuff and we've probably got the biggest team in the country doing this today.
But clearly there are different markets where different carriers want to undertake some of this themselves and that's completely fine.
And to the extent we can be helpful and let them utilize our component being the fiber we will do that.
So that's kind of how the dynamic is shaping up in the market and either way works for us.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay thanks.
And then maybe just one follow-up on the small cells.
I think we have a pretty good understanding now of what the up-front CapEx and returns look like.
But I was hoping to get a better sense of what the ongoing capital intensity is and maybe the useful life of the carrier equipment on the nodes kind of in comparison to the traditional tower business? Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Sure.
Initially when we've built one on these systems the operating expenses represent about 40% of the initial revenues.
So it's about 60% margins out of the gate there.
As I mentioned in an earlier question on CapEx there's very little ongoing maintenance CapEx associated with these systems.
Most of the maintenance if you think about it that way would be embedded in that 40% of operating cost.
Over the longer term the asset that we typically own in small cells would be the fiber asset.
Most of that as Ben mentioned earlier is dark fiber.
And then the other asset that we would own on the various locations where the tenants are putting their equipment we would own a cabinet often referred to as like a shroud at the location and the carriers would put the electronics inside of that cabinet or shroud.
We have seen already in the early days of the business the carriers come back and upgrade their electronics over time but re-utilized the cabinet.
So there's a pretty good parallel to what we see at the tower sites in terms of reusing the infrastructure the cabinets if you will or the shelters and just upgrading the electronics inside.
So we don't anticipate a meaningful amount of future CapEx or useful life degradation of the assets that we own.
The carriers we would expect over time to continue to put the capital in to replace their electronics and upgrade very similar to what they do on the tower side.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
That's very helpful.
Thank you.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Thanks Matt.
And next we'll go to Mike McCormack with Jefferies.
Hey guys.
Thanks.
Not to beat the table too hard on the small cell stuff but just getting a sense from you guys if you would on what you're seeing out there sort of on the ground as that gets deployed as far as speed to market is it pacing the way the carriers anticipated it would? And maybe any complexities or hurdles they've had to overcome in building that out? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah Mike.
It's never fast enough.
I'd be quick to speak for our carrier customers and say that they would tell us it's never fast enough.
So that's the struggle we have every day is that when they show up and engage us to build a system or co-locate on a system it needs to be done sort of tomorrow.
And the challenge we all have is that it's all new ground.
It's new ground for us in certain markets it's new ground for the carriers they haven't done this themselves before either.
And we're working through the various permitting and zoning and construction time lines that are required there.
So I'd say we're getting better.
We've done more than anybody in the marketplace and we are certainly getting better and finding ways to gain days back in that cycle.
But it's still some of it is outside of our control.
And to that end we're continuing to work with municipalities and other jurisdictions to continue to gain access and the right of way as quickly as we possibly can.
I mean is that just sort of a blocking and tackling building-by-building type of thing Ben or is it more widespread where you can do it and figure how...
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> It depends on the jurisdiction honestly.
A lot of it is construction services some markets are harder than others depending upon their affinity for wireless service honestly and whether or not they want to be supportive of additional wireless capacity in their market or not.
And it's why we a couple of years ago three years ago we got federal legislation 6409 out of congress to help us mandate co-location on towers.
It's incredible that that had to be a federal law but it is.
And so we're still dealing with some of that even at the micro level for small cells and it's hard to understand why a community wouldn't want to promote wireless broadband in their community.
But we're continuing to encounter that and it's just something that's part of the business and we work through it.
Great.
Thanks guys.
And next we'll go to Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.
Hey guys.
Thanks for taking the question.
Just to take a step back I was hoping you could articulate how you get from AFFO per share of 8% growth next year to your long-term targets of 6% to 7%.
When I run some calculations it looks like revenue growth should accelerate by about 100 basis points into 2017 and 2018 just from churn at PCS LEAP and ClearWire ending.
So any color you can sort of provide on the puts and takes as to your long-term forecast would be really helpful.
Treasurer &amp; Senior VP</span></strong> Sure Spencer.
Appreciate the question.
As we think about the 8% growth that we have going into 2016 as I mentioned in my earlier comments we expect about 1.5% of that is coming from the acquisition that we did in Sunesys.
So on an organic basis if you will or a normalized basis we've got about 6.5% to 6.6% growth coming out of the business.
You're right to note from the supplements that we've provided that churn comes down and what we attempted to do when we set the long-term target of 6% to 7% AFFO per share growth rate we tried to as best we could look at the landscape of all the things that could go positively for us as well as negatively into that number and give you an all-in robust view of what would happen at the AFFO per share.
And our best estimates would include that runoff of churn which we're certainly expecting a non-renewal that you're illuminating.
But we're also as we think about interest rates in the business we're running that model assuming the forward interest rate curve.
So we would assume that there will be some negative impact as rates rise over time and that would in essence offset some of the benefits that we would expect to see over time from the non-renewals.
So we're trying to as best we can give you an all-in view a robust view as we think about modeling the business ourselves and running our corporate model.
And so there's some of that impact.
There is one other thing that you should think about as you're modeling 2017 and think about the growth rate from 2016 to 2017.
The preferred instrument that we did a couple of years back that actually converts mandatorily converts to equity at the end of 2016.
That has a drag on growth and AFFO per share of about 100 basis points.
So as the dividend goes away if you will which we're including currently as a deduction to AFFO and then the shares go into the denominator of the number of shares outstanding if you will.
So that probably will help you bridge a little bit and maybe some of the puts and takes you should think about to match your forecast closer to what we're thinking about long term.
Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I think we have time for maybe one more question this morning.
Okay.
We'll go to Walter Piecyk with BTIG.
Thanks.
I just wanted to go back to Amir's question I think that was last hour.
Your answer was extremely bullish on data growth.
It's actually similar to what Malone has talked about as far as we're going to need cell sites and small cells and Wi-Fi everything.
So I guess the question is have you talked to the cable operators or Google about accessing your fiber for their Wi-Fi hotspots? I mean it's a version of a small cell itself.
I wonder if that dialogue has begun.
Because if you believe in that future which you guys obviously do and I think others do as well shouldn't those conversations be happening about now? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
Walter all I'll say is we've talked to a lot of people about our fiber and it's gotten attention from a lot of folks that we've got a significant amount of metro fiber holdings now exactly in the places where you as you've identified people are going to want it.
That goes back to the monetization of fiber question and absolutely something we're looking at.
I can't put anything in guidance today and I'm not going to use any proper names about exactly who we're speaking to.
But that's something over time that I think there's a revenue opportunity and we've got...
But it's reasonable to assume that those dialogues are – I mean I'm not asking you whether...
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah it is.
It is.
Yes.
Okay.
And then just one other question on – yeah.
And one other question on small cells.
If you think about the wireless – the four wireless operators if there's upside next year in your small cell business specifically do you suspect that it's going to be more from an existing guy getting more aggressive or that that business model will extend to the operators that maybe are not as embracing of small cells? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I'd say both.
I'd say both.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> That's what happens.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong> Hey listen.
We really wore everybody out this morning and I appreciate those that have hung on the call.
We wanted to make sure we got to everybody.
Very much appreciate you joining us today.
We're thrilled to death about this sort of first anniversary of raising the dividend as we have 8% here today which is very significant as we continue to differentiate our business model and our objectives going forward.
We think it's a very compelling story and we'll talk to you again next quarter.
Thank you.
And this concludes today's conference.
Thank you for your participation.
Please standby.
We are about to begin.
Good day and welcome to the Crown Castle International Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
Today’s conference is being recorded.
At this time I’d like to turn the conference over to Son Nguyen VP Finance and IR.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you Matt and good morning everyone.
Thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results.
With me on the call this morning are Ben Moreland Crown Castle’s Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown Crown Castle’s Chief Financial Officer.
To aid the discussion we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.
This conference call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions and actual results may vary materially from those expected.
Information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the company’s SEC filings.
Our statements are made as of today January 28 2016 and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.
In addition today’s call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information package in the Investors section of the company’s website at crowncastle.com.
With that I’ll turn the call over to Jay.
Thanks Son and good morning everyone.
As you saw from our release yesterday the fourth quarter was another great quarter bringing 2015 to a strong close and positioning us to raise our full-year 2016 outlook.
For the full-year 2015 AFFO per share of $4.30 was up 8% compared to 2014.
And our increased midpoint for full-year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.68 represents a 9% increase compared to 2015.
In addition to delivering great results and extending our track record of execution 2015 was marked by several significant accomplishments.
During 2015 we achieved an investment grade credit ratings from each of S&amp;P and Fitch Ratings.
Also during the year we redeployed capital from the divestiture of our former Australian subsidiary to further grow and strengthen our leadership position in wireless infrastructure in the U.S.
which we believe is the most attractive market for wireless investment.
Today with our portfolio of approximately 40 000 towers and 16 000 miles of fiber supported small cell deployment we are able to provide wireless carriers comprehensive solutions across the country as they continue to upgrade and enhance their networks to the increasing demand for mobile data.
Shifting to the fourth quarter results in Slide 4 site rental revenue grew 9% year-over-year from $723 million to $785 million an increase of $62 million.
The $62 million increase is comprised of $49 million of organic site rental revenue growth less $17 million in adjustments for straight-line accounting associated with contracted fixed rate tenant escalation plus $30 million in contributions from acquisitions which primarily consisted of Sunesys and other adjustment.
The organic site rental revenue growth of $49 million represents growth of 7% year-over-year comprised of approximately 10% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalation net of approximately 3% from tenant non-renewals.
Moving to Slide 5 our fourth quarter results for site rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided fourth quarter 2015 outlook.
Turning to investment activities as shown on Slide 6 during the fourth quarter we invested $251 million in capital expenditures of which $29 million was sustaining capital expenditures and $222 million was discretionary investment.
Included in our discretionary investments is approximately $23 million for land purchases.
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we seek to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time.
Today three quarters of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own or control for more than 20 years.
Where we have ground leases the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years.
Of the remaining discretionary investment we invested a $199 million in revenue-generating capital expenditures consisting of $90 million on existing sites and $109 million on the construction of new sites primarily small cell construction activity.
Small cells continue to perform ahead of expectation and currently generate 12% of total site rental revenues and 11% of total site rental gross margin.
Excluding the benefit from our recent acquisition of Sunesys small cell site rental revenues grew approximately 30% year-over-year.
Today our small cell networks consist of approximately 17 000 nodes on or under construction supported by 16 000 miles of fiber.
Of the 17 000 nodes approximately 12 000 of the nodes are on air with the other approximately 5 000 nodes under construction and expected to be completed over the next 12 months to 24 months.
Continuing on the financing activities during the quarter we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share or $295 million in the aggregate.
For the full-year 2016 we paid a quarterly common stock dividend in aggregate of $3.345 per common share.
Additionally in January we closed from a $5.5 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility.
Proceeds from the New Facility together with cash on hand were used to repay our previous Senior Secured Credit Facility.
As of January 26 we had $1.6 billion of availability under our five-year revolver.
As a result of the refinancing our senior unsecured notes were upgraded by S&amp;P to investment grade.
Even more impactful than lowering the cost of debt we believe that an investment grade capital structure will ultimately drive down our cost of equity.
Equally as important we believe having access to a deeper pool of capital will result in a more stable long-term cash flows and increase flexibility to pursue discretionary growth opportunity.
Moving on to the full-year 2016 on Slide 7 we have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues by $10 million site rental gross margins by $7 million and adjusted EBITDA by $12 million and AFFO by a $11 million.
The increase in the outlook reflects the strong results from the fourth quarter our continuing belief that 2016 leasing activity will be similar to 2015 and the timing benefit related to tenant non-renewals occurring later than previously expected.
It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant non-renewals and aggregates has remained unchanged.
For more detailed information regarding our current book of contracted tenant leases including our expectations for non-renewals those are available in our supplemental information package.
At the AFFO per share line the updated midpoint of our full-year 2016 outlook resulted 9% growth year-over-year compared to 2015 increasing from $4.30 per share to $4.68 per share.
Like 2015 2016 is shaping up to be another great year.
We believe the essential elements for long-term shareholder value creation are as attractive as they’ve ever been.
We continue to see stable and consistent leasing activity from our carrier customers.
We have a runway of attractive discretionary investment opportunities primarily in the form of small cells to enhance and grow our business.
And we have an opportunity to manage the cost of debt and lower the cost of equity as we transition to an investment grade balance sheet.
All of this gives us confidence in maintaining our long-term goal of delivering AFFO per share and dividend per share growth of 6% to 7% on an annual basis.
Before turning the call over to Ben I’d like to take just a moment to discuss the announced succession plan.
I’m honored and excited to have the opportunity to lead the Crown Castle team.
I have had the privilege of working with Ben over the last 17 years and he has been a great friend and mentor to me.
Over the last eight years through Ben’s leadership as CEO we have grown the business significantly.
Increasing AFFO per share from $1.66 to $4.30 and have successfully doubled the size of our tower portfolio established ourselves as the leader in small cell and strengthened our balance sheet positioning us better than ever to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead.
I will benefit greatly in my new roles I’m being surrounded by a very talented and experienced executive team that has been instrumental in all of these accomplishments.
Together with the rest of the Crown Castle Team we are looking forward to continuing to execute on our strategy of driving long-term shareholder returns through disciplined capital allocation dividend growth and delivering for our customers.
And with that I’ll turn it over to Ben.
Thanks Jay and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning extra early.
I’ll touch on our succession plan in a moment.
First I’d like to comment on 2015 results and what lies ahead.
In short we had a great year exceeding our expectations throughout the year and executing on strategic actions through the sale of our Australian subsidiary and the purchase of the Sunesys fiber assets that really sets us up well to win in the future.
I want to thank my colleagues at Crown Castle for their hard work in delivering on our commitments in 2015.
Now on to the future.
As Jay just mentioned we believe we have the essential elements for long-term shareholder value creation are as attractive as ever.
I’d like to spend a few minutes to further elaborate on Jay’s comments regarding each of these elements.
These included a continued healthy and sustained leasing environment over the next several years a long runway of investment opportunities that we expect will drive high quality long-term growth and all the while maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing risk appropriately to drive down the cost of capital.
First on leasing we believe that we’re in the midst of a multi-year wireless investment cycle that will result in same level of leasing activity similar to what we have experienced in 2014 and 2015 and that is what we expect to see in 2016.
For 2016 we’re expecting approximately $170 in new leasing activity of which – $115 million will come from tower leasing.
The $115 million in tower leasing represents the space of adding approximately one tenant equivalent over a 10-year period on our 40 000 towers or a tenth of a tenant per year per tower which is approximately our average pace of annual leasing over the last seven years.
Importantly through those seven years we’ve been through a number of different macro economic cycles and covered several different wireless investment cycles in terms of technology level of engagement by carrier customers in different environments.
Given the underlying long-term perspective – positive fundamentals from the continued increase in mobile data consumption we believe that this pace of leasing is a reasonable expectation for our future growth.
Industry research projects mobile data to increase seven-fold between 2014 and 2019 a compounded annual growth rate of 47% or roughly doubling every two years.
Recently some of the wireless carriers have reported mobile data growth even higher in the range of 60% to 75% per year growth during 2015.
Against this backdrop we expect the carriers to continue to invest on a consistent basis to maintain and improve network quality which is the competitive necessity as carriers seek to retain existing customers attract new customers and monetize their networks through the deployment – development of new revenue streams such as over-the-top video and telematics.
As a shared wireless infrastructure provider Crown Castle stands ready to assist wireless carriers in this endeavor by providing them with quick and cost effective access to our wireless infrastructure as they seek to upgrade and enhance their networks.
With our tower portfolio and small cell expertise we have the unique capability to deliver across all means of shared infrastructure to meet the network needs of our carrier customers.
Additionally the runway for our growth is further supported by the amount of spectrum but is expected to be deployed over the next several years including the spectrum from last year’s AWS-3 auction the spectrum from this year’s anticipated broadcast incentive auction and the spectrum currently held by the carriers and others such as a DISH and FirstNet.
Turning to capital allocation when we evaluate various investment alternatives we have whether its small cell share purchases or acquisitions our goal is to drive long-term growth in AFFO per share and dividend per share.
By this measure we are very excited by our recent and ongoing investment in small cells.
Today our $3 billion investment in small cells generates a yield of approximately 8% inclusive of our initial $1 billion investment in NextG the acquisition we did in 2012 with an initial yield of approximately 3% to 4% and our continued Greenfield investments.
We are underwriting new small cell builds with anticipated initial yields of 6% to 8% on the anchor tenant where we believe we have the opportunity to drive yields higher through co-location.
But the second tenant expected to achieve a low-to-mid teens yields and the expectation of further yield accretion when we add third and fourth tenant overtime.
On this point in addition to the anchor tenant we are seeing strong co-location demand on our small cell networks.
We have focused our small cell efforts in the top 25 markets and believe that these early systems will be some of the most attractive locations in the future given their franchise value.
Just like towers the need for network densification is driving small cell growth.
Given the challenges in the carrier space and bringing more capacity to many urban and suburban geographies we need to get closer to the subscribers and focus on reusing spectrum more efficiently carriers returning to small cells as a critical tool to improve their networks.
With a very similar business and economic model as our tower business we see a long runway of attractive investment opportunities in small cells.
Shifting to the balance sheet and risk profile we view our dividend as a growing annuity paid to shareholders where we effectively pass through the cash flows we generate from providing the U.S.
wireless carriers access to mission critical infrastructure.
Our goal is to protect and grow the dividend stream overtime.
Our dividend is supported by long-term recurring contracted leases that we have in place which currently represent approximately $20 billion in future contracted rent payments plus future growth from contracted rent escalators and a continuing wireless investments being made that I previously mentioned.
From this foundation we are focused on managing financial and operating risk as we allocate capital and grow the business.
On the balance sheet side we believe in maintaining an investment grade balance sheet should provide us with access to a deeper and more stable pool of capital reducing risk through our cash flows and providing us with an increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities both of which are supportive of the secure and growing dividend.
This same perspective drives our capital allocation decisions as we continue to believe that the U.S.
market provides us with the most attractive risk adjusted return opportunities.
Bottom line with a sustained level of leasing that we expect to continue over the next several years the small cell opportunities we see ahead of us the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our business.
We believe we can continue to deliver 6% to 7% AFFO per share and dividend growth per share.
Further we believe our expected growth rate combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4.3% represents a very attractive long-term total return profile for share holders.
Finally I’d like to speak to our CEO succession plan that we announced last night.
I began contemplating this and subsequently engaged the board in this conversation sometime ago after reflecting on a number of considerations that led me to conclude that 2016 was the right time to begin this transition.
First as we’ve discussed on this call the company is incredibly well-positioned for this transition.
Having accomplished a number of strategic objectives that I believe are important to set us up for the next generation and market leadership and value creation.
Including on this list – included on this list would be the assemblage of our unrivalled tower portfolio the sale of our Australian business the acquisition of Sunesys and leadership in the exciting small cell arena and the strengthened balance sheet with the achievement of the investment grade rating late last year.
Second Jay is ready ready to step up.
We’ve worked together for 17 years since the early days of Crown Castle and he has been an integral part of all we have accomplished.
He has the trust and respect of the board the executive team and the organization as well as the investment community.
I’m very fortunate to have him as a successor and have absolute confidence that he is the right leader to lead the organization into this next chapter of success.
Most importantly though Jay will be leading a team of seasoned professionals who are very good at executing for customers across all our assets both towers and small cells.
Finally on a personal level it’s been an unbelievable privilege to lead Crown as CEO these last eight years.
I have always found it valuable from time to time to push myself out of my comfort zone in search of new challenges.
Many years ago I lost my dad to a heart attack when he was only 47.
In 2014 my wife had a breast cancer scare and fortunate was caught early and through surgery has resulted in a full recovery.
With our kids out of the house now our once structured lives have changed.
It is with all these considerations and the reminder that life is short that I sense this is the right time to initiate this move out of my comfort zone.
I look forward to pursuing many new challenges some personal and some professional.
I also look forward to my continuing investment and involvement with Crown Castle in this new capacity ensuring leadership continuity as Executive Vice Chairman.
I am proud of what we’ve accomplished and through the succession plan I’m highly confident this team will continue to reward shareholders customers and employees for choosing Crown Castle.
Thank you to all of you on this call who have supported me and this management team over the years.
I look forward to our continued association.
And with that operator I’d be happy to turn the call over for questions.
Hey guys thanks Ben.
You know this is not the last quarter we’re going to chance to talk but thanks for all that and the contributions.
And Jay congrats on the job.
I’m looking forward to continue to work with both of you guys.
Kind of focusing on the business is the kind of look ahead I guess I’ve got a couple of questions.
One just on the obvious with respect to kind of all the noise coming out of Sprint with respect to their network architecture we don’t have to talk about Sprint necessarily as to say there’s a carrier out there that’s looking to explore new more efficient ways to build a network and it seems that they are looking to reevaluate their renewal schedule on tower leases as we go forward.
I was wondering if you can kind of talk about what if anything you see ahead for that strategy.
And then second Jay a year ago we were sitting here and I think the outlook was for new site leasing activity of maybe 5% and now we’re sitting here looking at actually 6% a better outlook for this year over the course of last year that outlook actually went up by about a percentage point.
So what are the factors that you see maybe evolving in 2016 that could do to this year’s guidance what happened to last year’s guidance in terms of walking it up the curve over the course of the year? Thanks.
Sure Dave hi this is Ben.
First of all without addressing Sprint specifically what I’d like to talk about is the fact that three of the four carriers have reported thus far and I think all of them in various ways have confirmed the need for macro sites being an integral part of their network now and in future and that shouldn’t be surprising any of us that are close to the business.
Macro sites i.e.
towers remain the most attractive and cost effective way to cover a given geography with the spectrum that they own.
That said there are certainly hybrid sites and head net [ph] architectures that we participate in and many people do.
That are going to augment the capacity of the networks going forward and that’s the whole small cell underlay approach.
And frankly sites that look like crosses between macro sites and small cells dark fiber fed and ultimately that sort of what CRAN architecture starts to look like overtime.
When you think about our business fundamentally it’s a capital intensive business.
Goes with the lowest cost of capital tend to win and when you introduced on top of that the notion of shared economics i.e.
the carriers only pay for the proportion of the asset that they need.
It’s an incredibly compelling model and it’s one that I think is going to continue to work as it has for the last 20 years for the indefinite future.
So when carriers work on new deployments and new architectures with certainly an appropriate view to save cost we’re going to be right there with them at every step of the way.
And I can tell you that we’re working with all four carriers in that regard to utilize our cost of capital and the sharing model to be an integral part of their solution going forward.
And so I think it’s been helpful for the last couple of weeks that three out of four carriers have confirmed that macro tower sites are an integral part of their model going forward.
That’s not surprising to us.
But I think this hybrid-type network going forward is going to be very important and we’re incredibly well positioned with assets and capability to take advantage of that.
But when you hear us talk about the cost of capital it’s not simply just to lower the cost on the balance sheet of our interest expense it is very much to the most competitive company out there that can deploy capital assets on behalf of these carriers and make it very efficiently for them.
And so that’s something we’re spending a lot of time on it and executive team and I’m very comfortable with what we see in front of us.
Dave and your second question last year the 2015 increase in guidance over the course of the year about half of that was driven from an increase in leasing activity and about half of that was driven from lower non-renewals than what we had expected going into the year.
And as we look at our guidance for 2016 we held that elevated level of leasing activities throughout the full calendar year 2016 such that leasing activity we think this year will match that of 2015.
As there are potential upside there I’d point to the fact that typically in the business we have about six months to eight months of visibility – from the time we have an application coming from a carrier to the time it’s actually revenue producing.
So we have a real good idea as to where new tenant leasing is going to be through at least the first half of the year or maybe dead-end of the third quarter.
So to the extent that there was additional leasing activity over the course of year that’s honestly more likely to impact our run rates going into 2017 then it is to be that meaningful to result in 2016.
Got it.
All right thank you very much guys.
Thanks good morning guys.
First I like all the comments congrats to Jay and Ben it’s been a great ride long time together in the tower space for us and looking back at my notes I think Crown is up 4X since 17 years ago.
So congrats to both of you guys.
Thank you.
Thanks.
First question I’ve got is if a carrier does decide not to renew their lease what triggers there? And do they have to remove the equipment and how much could that cost? typically our contracts require them to remove the equipment and restore site what we and we’ve gone through that many times with these non-renewals that Jay has talked about and we’ve experienced with the next [indiscernible].
What we’ve often done though is essentially negotiate a final payment if you will what was commonly referred to in the industry as pay and walk fee and that could be anywhere from sort of $30 000 to $50 000 per site depending on what’s out there and the negotiations but that’s generally what occurs.
And so more often than not we’ll negotiate a final payment that’s typically the market convention.
Makes sense.
Also this quarter we saw a pop-up in the SG&amp;A line can you talk a little bit about what is occurring there and can we think of that maybe as a revenue driver longer-term? Yes the SG&amp;A pop-up a bit of that would be related to having Sunesys for all three months of the quarter Ric.
And then the other part of it the business outperformed our bonus level for across the employee base for the full-year 2015 would have been above kind of our targeted level as we raised outlook throughout the course of the year and delivered and even exceed it in the fourth quarter.
I think if you look at calendar year 2016 we think the run rate is basically unchanged from full-year 2015.
So as we talked about on previous call we think that there’s virtually no cost increase at the GAAP line on the tower side or on the SG&amp;A side for calendar year 2016 and that would be based on the current level of activity that we see in small cells ex cetera.
We’ll obviously have some operating costs in small cells as we deployed brand new systems.
But for most part on the tower side we think costs are flat and on the SG&amp;A we think those costs are flat in 2016 to 2015.
That make sense.
And then on Sunesys you’d talked in the past about some extension maybe that could be done half of those existing fiber that Sunesys brought in.
Update us a little bit about what you’re seeing in that extension mode? Sure.
The rationale behind the 10 000 miles of fiber providing great bargains are Sunesys it would give is a great head start on small cell deployments and that’s exactly what it is.
But it’s a head start it’s not a perfect footprint and so as you referenced we’re constantly working to improve that our network just as we do with existing Crown fiber where we get a new engagement and maybe there’s as I’ve described before there’s always overlap.
So when you think of a tower co-location which is 100% co-location on existing site co-location or an additional deployment on a Sunesys piece of fiber or Crown fiber is always a hybrid.
So there’s always a percentage of overlap and a percentage of new typically.
But in examples may be otherwise like Manhattan where there was pretty full overlap.
So that’s working well.
It drives our increasing created yield on the asset.
As I mentioned in my remarks we’re up to about 8% on the embedded capital like to date.
And so as we’re building additional either additional laterals or accommodating co-locations it’s essentially driving up that yield overtime.
And we’re going to have better metrics for you in the coming quarters because I know this has got a lot of moving parts to it.
And we’re going to come out with that for everyone to help their modeling later in the year.
What we focus on as a management team is ultimately the yield on the invested capital.
That cuts through all the metrics whether it’s tenants per node or nodes per mile or revenue per mile.
And so we’re going to help everybody with that later in the year so that we can all be clear but that’s why we’re giving you these sort of run rate yields it’s validating for ourselves as well that we’re continuing to see accretive investments in that space.
Great thanks guys.
Thanks and also congrats to you guys really exciting news.
As we think about where you’re deploying capital you sort of listed a couple of potential areas of discretionary investment.
I might have missed it but I don’t think you actually include towers on the list.
I’m curious whether you feel like the portfolio towers that you have today is essentially the portfolio you’ll be operating and generating returns off of for the foreseeable future.
And then just as an extension you talked about the importance of small cells and how you’ve invested in that.
And as you see your carriers kind of evolve how they’re thinking about deploying venture networks do you feel like the outdoor business that you have in the top 25 markets today is really what you need or do you see opportunities to create partnerships or make investments in other areas to further accelerate your positioning in that market? Thanks.
Sure Brett.
First of all I didn’t mean to slide towers at all.
We bought 17 000 sites in the last I guess three years that we’re looking for more tenants.
So those towers we acquired from AT&amp;T and T-Mobile most recently are very attractive co-location candidates.
And probably not probably absolutely represent the biggest value creation opportunity we have in the company.
That is to co-locate on an existing tower and we’re quite happy with that going forward.
The fact is that the carriers had essentially sold the vast majority of their site.
There’s some small portfolios out there.
And it has been somewhat aggregated by the three large carry tower companies.
So I don’t see anything large on the horizon out there.
It’s certainly not a requirement for us to create significant value as I mentioned the organic growth is what drives value around here.
But I would also highlight go back to 2001 and 2000 and 1999 when essentially the carriers sold all their sites initially and then we went through a whole another wave of that some 15 years later.
So we do think there’ll be a need for more tower sites overtime as cell sites continue to shrink and density requirements continue to increase.
There’s nothing significant out there today and we are certainly advancing our leadership position on this newer architecture around small cells as we talked about.
On the outdoor business for small cells while we are about 90% focused in the top 25 markets we’re constantly looking at opportunities outside the 25 markets.
And so your question I think goes to sort of how big could this be? And the answer is we don’t really know but it looks like it could be sort of a whole another tower business.
It’s hard it’s expensive it takes a long time to build these systems but at the same time we are focused on what we think our franchise locations in something of a land grab that reminds us a lot of the early days of the tower business and so we’re focusing our efforts in the top 25 markets but I don’t think it’s going to be limited to that.
In fact I know it’s not because we’re looking at opportunities occasionally outside those markets and looks like it’s got a long long runway.
And that’s primarily outdoor opportunities I mean it just seems like there’s a lot different types of small cell solutions there’s indoor solutions and rooftops and I’m just wondering whether those areas are peaking your interest as well? Well we have an indoor business and we do quite well with it where we choose to play we’ve done a lot of sports arenas things like that.
I think overtime you’re going to see multi tenant office buildings but there are alternative solutions available to the landlords and tenants when you get into a multi tenant facility that don’t necessarily lend themselves to a neutral host owner like ourselves.
A tenant in an office building can set up their own system or an office building can own their system there’s lot of different variations.
And then there’s a limitation in the marketplace still as to what the carriers will ultimately elect to pay for in terms of the rent.
As we’ve said forever and we all know this there’s more need in the market for densification and network and there are hours in the day or capital that the carriers can invest.
So there’s a rational prioritization going on.
I think you’re certainly seeing this extend to healthcare facilities now.
And so we’re certainly looking at the indoor building business where there when we find it attractive.
But it’s – I don’t think it’s as large as the outdoor business.
Okay.
Thanks for that color.
Okay.
Good morning and thanks to ask the questions two if I could.
Your first observation that you add more nodes on to relatively flat amount of fiber mile is that a trend that should continue and how does that affect your return on capital opportunity from that business overtime? And then secondly I’m curious what you’re seeing on the propagation side for small cells? And how would you compare the radius of a small cell in your expense versus the macro? And are there changes in technology that’s going to affect the relationship over time? Thanks.
On your first question Mike you are pointing out a good observation there.
You’re right miles of fiber were relatively flat and we added nodes against those fibers miles which is exactly colocation.
I mean that’s the business we are in and why we’re interested and like the tower business and why we like the small cell business.
You have an asset investment against which you add additional recurring revenue and that drives the long-term yield on that invested capital.
And that’s the model we’re seeing play out.
As Ben and I referenced in our comments On the second question the propagation characteristics of small cells there’s no simple answer to that question or one-size-fits-all answer to that question.
Its designed based on what the carriers desire.
And so you can go into a given area and find a small cell every 200 yards where they are trying to increase the density of their network.
At other places you’ll see them spaced a little further than that.
So there’s no easy answer to say that the propagation of a small cell it has to do with what spectrum may deploy across that small cell how much power they use.
So it can vary.
I would say in a typical urban environment you’re going to cover about a block to two blocks of area when you deploy – when the carriers deploy small cells.
And we’ll see them put up nodes about every other block would be a relatively normal deployment in a dense urban area.
If you look across the entire portfolio on an outdoor basis where we’re typically when we’re building a new system for someone we’ll be somewhere between 2 nodes and 2.5 nodes per mile of fiber on the initial deployment.
So that gives you some idea of what we see and obviously there can be some pretty wide swings depending on whether or not we’re doing central business district or doing something a little bit outside of the most densely populated areas of the city.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
Hi this is Richard Joe for Phil.
Just wanted to follow-up a little bit more on a small cells we wanted to get a sense of the competition is like small cells how many RFPs are competitive and how is the pricing held up? Yes hi Richard it’s Ben.
It’s very competitive and look we’re the leader in the space and we believe we have more capability for what we turn key deployments which all in building systems locating antennas on fiber that we build.
But at the same time there are other very capable competitors out there and we see competition in the marketplace.
It goes back to my original comments about cost to capital matters in this business.
And so that’s something that we focus on.
Not going to get really into the specifics around the market a lot of these systems are conducted through an RFP process initially but at the same time what matters most to carriers obviously is the ability of the award winner to execute.
And so we have seen opportunities come back to us on occasion where the awardee may have had some challenges in the market.
What matters most to carriers if they have a need for small cells is execution meeting your milestones getting on the air so that they can accomplish the capacity enhancements that they are trying to do on their network.
So I think it’s [indiscernible] I will say on that it’s a highly competitive market these days.
Great.
And then a quick follow-up in terms of your guidance should we think of this small cell business just ramping through the year or is this going to be more back-end loaded as the bills kind pile up so to speak.
On both the towers and small cell side the year is the bit back-end loaded it’s about 40% of the activity in the first half of the year and about 60% in the second half of the year.
Great thank you.
You bet.
Yes so I have a question about the push out of the non-renewals and wondering which projects that refers to is it WiMax or iDEN or one of two CDMA decommissions that’s been happening? And then just generally kind of your macro tower business wondering what new developments are seen in your pipeline as it pertains to things like AWS-3 overlays or macro site densification or any and then I guess I have a quick follow-up on small cells.
Thanks.
Yes.
On the first question </strong> we hesitate to comment specifically on what carriers are doing.
I think I’ll pass on that it comes from several sources John its not one single source and we updated actually probably have seen in the supplement our expectation for churn for the next several years and that’s in aggregate.
I wouldn’t say we’re seeing anything at this point I would point out is changing our overall view of the non-renewals.
I think we’ve been pretty specific in the past about the amount of consolidation churn in non-renewals and what was driving that.
And our underlying assumptions are basically intact for that today.
The second question on the tower side we’re seeing carriers do all kinds of things on the macro side.
There’s been simplification [ph] activities there’s amendment that’s adding new technology they’re supporting additional spectrum that we’ve seen and the mix of both amendments and new cell and brand new cell sites in 2016 is pretty similar to what we saw in 2015.
So we’re not seeing any trends here that I would point to it as changes from what we saw in 2015.
Just to add to that.
John just real quick to add that as we’ve pursued the small cell business we’ve talked about on this call and remain very enthusiastic about the opportunity again the first thing a carrier does is add densification is macro tower sites.
And everywhere we’re building small cells there are macro tower coverages already there.
So if you were to stand on the street corner where we have a deployment you would already have a macro site covering keyword covering that geography.
And so we’re building small cell networks essentially and underlay approach in to add capacity to these networks.
But certainly the macro tower site is what happens first and that’s continuing to be what we see on the tower side.
And then I guess segwaying into the small cell is there a different as of demand that are seen in terms of which carriers are coming on to your infrastructure? And then I guess related to that and related to what Mike was asking as well is the nodes you expect to have this year how much would be kind of a long existing fiber routes that have been activated with your infrastructure second or third tenancies if you will along the same route versus new laterals that haven’t been activated with your data infrastructure? Go ahead Jay.
I was to about say on the first question when we go into any given year there’s an expectation we have around ranges for each of the carriers.
And I wouldn’t point to anything in calendar year 2016 that looks that much different than what we saw in 2015.
We’re seeing activity on both the macro side as well as small cells from all four of the operators.
We saw that throughout 2015 and we would expect the same thing in 2016.
On the mix of leasing in small cells it’s about a 75% mix of where we’re deploying brand new systems in places that we did not previously have small cell systems and about of the leasing activity would be coming from co-locations on existing systems.
And then finally on the CFO search any particular criteria that you are looking for in terms of the background of the individual you’re looking to hire? Well based on some initial conversations I think we can attract extremely seasoned and qualified candidates that we’re very optimistic there this spring having a great new addition to the team and more to come on that.
Thanks good luck.
Thanks John.
Thank you very much and good morning.
Simply want to echo the comments Ben wish you the best of luck as you look to make what I suspect we all hope will be an exciting transition for you and your family.
Thanks.
In terms of questions I’ve two if I may.
On the first you mentioned some of the upcoming spectrum that seems to be coming to market I mean obviously there have been selected carriers who’ve talked about the opportunity set in terms of providing additional bandwidth with deployment of fellow spectrum.
But there have also been discussions about how networks are dense enough and how additional capacity.
And I’m just trying to sort of triangulate in terms of the opportunities that for you folks I mean do you see those types of carriers looking to densify their networks? How should we think about the potential amendment opportunities going forward with things like AWS-3 in terms of providing support for the longer term runway? Sure and I think what you’re referring to is Amir is the inherent trade-off that is between spectrum and densification i.e.
to the extent you have more spectrum you can do more with your existing sites and within to lay the need to densify in a particular area if you otherwise didn’t have spectrum.
And that’s true and yet what we see is kind of all the above.
So as the carriers come in and launch new spectrum to get maximum efficiency out of that very expensive spectrum they’re typically adding more equipment to the site to the existing site.
That just makes sense.
The cost of that incremental amendment on a tower is nothing compared to getting the maximum value out of the spectrum in that particular geography.
And that’s what is driving a lot of our amendment activity across all of the carriers and as has for years.
I don’t see that changing.
But in addition to that you’re not going to cover the capacity requirements simply by adding spectrum to existing site.
It’s mathematically impossible you can’t get the capacity requirements that are required.
And so what happens is in addition to adding that spectrum on existing sites you’re then seeing small cells added in an underlay approach which gives them multiples of that spectrum capacity because they’re then reusing that spectrum in that geography and unloading effectively unloading the capacity challenge on the macro side.
So you’re going to see both it’s exactly what’s driving our business today.
The carriers are obviously being very rational about how do they prioritize their spend and they’re looking at spectrum auctions and having to pay for the spectrum up front.
And then how do they maximize that capacity overtime.
And then various carriers they are in various stages of that today whether that’s cell site densification or macro site amendment.
But all of that drives our business and it’s something that we think is going to continue for a long long time.
Thank you very much.
And then dovetailing on to small cells it seems as though the growth has been a bit higher than expected but of course it also seems like we’re still at the very early stages of adoption particularly when we think about sort of a neutral hosting business model.
I mean there has been some chatter in the marketplace with folks discussing opportunities to densify their networks going at it alone in terms of utilizing certain technologies or potentially possible rights of access or microwave backhaul or however you want to look at the combination of different opportunities.
How do you sort of compare and contrast the opportunities that you folks have utilizing assets such as Sunesys or some of this land grab that you had mentioned versus carriers looking to potentially densify their network via small cells on their own sort of strategy? Well I think you’re going to see sort of all the above and it’s not new if you think about it.
The wireless carriers essentially rebuilt the tower portfolio on their own balance sheet since we as an industry acquired in the early 2000s and then elected to monetize it overtime in the last three years.
I think carriers will from time to time experiment with lots of different methods to add capacities to their network that’s not new.
It goes back to the earlier comment and there’s a lot of different technology variations I think it’s generally accepted that fiber connectivity for small cells and towers ultimately through dark fiber connectivity provides the most flexibility and the most capacity for a given location.
And so I think you’re going to see overtime that fiber whether you’re talking about fiber-to-the-cell or fiber to the small cell is a necessary element long-term to accomplish what they need.
And it goes back to earlier comments on this call around cost of capital and the sharing model.
Certainly it’s possible for carriers to work and build their own systems and certainly free to do that and operate under the same constraints that we do around permitting and zoning and rights away and things like that.
But to the extent they can avail themselves of a lower cost of capital allow themselves to put their capital back to work in their primary business and we pass along some of that shared economics to them in that construct that’s going to make a lot of sense as it has for the last 20 years.
And that’s what we’re pursuing.
Excellent.
Thank you very much for the incremental color.
Sure.
Great thanks very much.
Ben and Jay congrats and good luck on your next move.
Ben I wonder if you just talk a little bit about your new roll I guess you’re going to have a real focus on strategy.
How do you see spending your time and what are the real areas that you think you’re going to be able to do dive deeper into with your new responsibilities? And then sort of following-up from the last question for Verizon has talked about a lot about 5G with trials coming up in the next month or two.
Micro waves is going to be – frequencies are going be deployed there.
Have you had much conversations with companies and with the equipment companies about the opportunities there and what that might mean over say the next five or ten years? And we saw fixed wireless launched yesterday.
So it does look like there’s other technologies which are really starting to appear on the horizon here.
If you could talk to that that would be great? Sure.
First of all on the role Simon we’re filling out the list but it keeps getting more items on it.
I think initially I’m going to certainly continue to spend time on industry matters whether that’s your PCI or NAREIT.
I’m on the board of both organizations and we’re making some good progress there in the interest of our company as well as the broader industry.
And I expect to continue in the capacity.
And then also I would expect to continue to work the executive team on matters of strategy capital allocations some of the discussions we’ve had on the call.
But would anticipate that given the longevity and tenure of the team this executive team and Jay in particular having worked together for 17 years and can finish each others [indiscernible] I do not think we’re going to have a difference of opinion very often on strategy.
So it’s really going to be a to the board and to industry matters that I think are increasingly important for us.
As we look to continue to have the ability to deploy wireless infrastructure in a very efficient way across the country and just for those on this call that is not getting any easier and so it’s something that I’m pretty focused on.
Any… Go on… Any movement from NAREIT on sort of index inclusion? Nothing definitive yet we will wait until August and we have our new GICS code and see how that goes.
Okay.
Thank you.
Simon on your second question I think you can roll back the clock and see that as the carriers have migrated technology that those have almost always been aimed at improving the consumer experience which is generally code for faster access to data network.
And those have always resulted in additional need for network density.
And I think regardless of – you rattled off a few opportunities that are on the horizon.
And we’re seeing carriers behave and think about the network planning whether we’re talking to them about macro sites or small cells in a very similar way that it’s going to result in additional network density being required and we think that’s great for our opportunity our opportunity as we deploy capital and see additional yield on the capital that we’ve already deployed.
Right thank you.
Great thank you for fitting me in and to both of you congrats with your newer opportunities.
Thanks Colby.
First up I wanted to kind of just levels of expectations around Sunesys.
So can you just remind us how fast Sunesys grew in 2015? And then what the implied growth rate is off of the $105 million which you guided for 2016? I’d appreciate that.
Sunesys contributed $42 million to you in 2015.
But I’m just trying to get the year-over-year comparisons.
And then just talking more about small cell you mentioned your focus on 25 markets and obviously looking beyond that in those 25 markets roughly how many of those are you – that where you’re comfortable with the amount of fiber that you have? And really what I’m getting at is what’s the likelihood of you going and doing another Sunesys like acquisition in 2016 how important is that to you when you think of strategy in areas you’re focusing on for 2016? If that acquisition you were to do was to come with a larger percentage of enterprise or wholesale or is that definitely not small cell like business in terms of how they’re using that fiber.
Is that a business you’re increasingly getting more comfortable getting into as we go forward so that you’re no longer just a small cell fiber provider but really something much more broader than that.
Thanks.
Sure.
Thanks for the question Colby.
On the first question when we did the Sunesys acquisition I know initially when we announced that we weren’t sure exactly what the timing of the closing was going to be.
The revenue growth year-over-year is a couple of million dollars.
So the guidance that we gave you was what we were expecting in 2016.
And really your two questions are fairly closely tied together.
When we look at fiber in these markets and the opportunities that we’re seeing more broadly than just Sunesys and whether that’s expanding our portfolio on the top 25 market or as Ben referenced earlier if we’re looking outside of the top 25 markets our aim is to own fiber that is supported by the wireless carriers.
That’s our core business and that’s what we’re focused on.
And so when we look at opportunities for fiber that’s what we have in mind of what can we do with that fiber ultimately to drive yield on the capital invested.
And we think that yield is going to be primarily driven through investment by the wireless carriers and I was adding nodes to those or in some cases doing fiber-to-the-cell.
There may be some acquisitions in the future frankly as we talked about when we did the Sunesys acquisition we think that asset is really unique it was dark fiber in major metro markets in the U.S.
And while we have found a few tuck-in acquisitions like the one we did two years ago in the Baltimore Washington area.
Those are relatively rare.
So we’re not thinking about this as getting into per se the fiber business or expanding into the fiber business.
Over time we may find opportunities to add additional yield through recurring revenue sources across the fiber that we own.
Because of the location of the fiber it’s in urban areas where there’s a lot of density of population.
And so we may find opportunities to add additional revenue and drive returns.
But our focus both on the investment side as well as where we’re focusing our sales effort is around supporting our wireless carrier customers.
That’s what we really want to do and what we want to be.
So that’s where you’re going to see us invest capital and focus our time and effort both in the near-term and what we believe currently will be the long-term strategy of the firm.
And just to clarify when you said Sunesys expectations you grew a couple of million are you saying that the 105 guidance for 2016 is effectively a couple of million higher than what Sunesys did as a whole in 2015? That’s correct.
If we obviously we did not own Sunesys for the entire 2015 period.
But that’s what it grew year-over-year.
That’s great.
Thank you.
You bet.
Okay.
Well I appreciate everybody’s time on call this morning.
Thanks for the questions I know there was a long lived cheer and there are several folks who probably did not get to.
We’re around today so feel free to pick up the phone and call us or you can reach up Son Nguyen.
And we’re happy to get your questions.
And look forward to talking to you next quarter.
