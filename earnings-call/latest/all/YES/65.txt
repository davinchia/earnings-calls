Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time for introductions and opening comments I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead ma'am.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Wayne Leonard; and Leo Denault our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] After the Q&amp;A session I will close with the applicable legal statements.
Wayne? Good morning everyone.
I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance which Leo will review with you in a moment.
Quarterly operational earnings per share topped the second quarter records set just 1 year ago despite the effect of the depressed power pricing on the wholesale business the power price contracts roll off.
We continue to pursue a full agenda of strategic initiatives that will take some time to fully play out.
In the meantime the commodity markets which are showing some signs of long-term recovery will continue to be a drag on earnings for at least the next couple of years.
I'll begin today by providing an update on the progress that we've made on some of those key initiatives.
Starting at the utility.
Our utility companies have worked hard for a long time to secure regulatory structures and mechanisms that allow a real opportunity to earn returns commensurate with investment alternatives at comparable risk.
You will see that these efforts are coming to fruition as you review the financial results.
For example since the end of 2001 average residential rates have increased a little over 0.5% per year over the near 10-year period or almost flat for 10 years while utility operational earnings per share at the midpoint of the 2011 guidance is nearly double the operational results 10 years ago.
At the same time our operational and our safety performance and our environmental record continues to set new company standards.
Our voluntary CO2 emissions reductions put us over 20% below the year 2000 level.
Formula rate plan filing for 2010 reflects earnings consistent with each company's bandwidth ranges in Louisiana and Mississippi and we are above the range in New Orleans.
Unseasonable weather in 2010 both a warm summer and a cold winter contributed to these results with industry Gulf States Louisiana -- Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans near the top end or above the range.
In total the New Orleans 2010 FRP filing reflected a $7.6 million decrease in electric and gas rates.
Also included in the Entergy New Orleans May filing was the request to increase storm funding by about $20 million to replace the cash storm reserve after expenditures for hurricanes Gustav and Ike allowing the cash storm reserve to reach the approved $75 million level on schedule by 2017.
The electric and gas rate changes are expected to be effective in October.
Turning to Texas.
Legislation was enacted in May allowing for a special rider to periodically adjust rates for changes in distribution estimate.
The Public Utility Commission of Texas is now in the process of repairing the rule-making and rate filing package to be completed by late September.
Entergy Texas also continues efforts to achieve a purchased power capacity rider after the PUCT reopened a rule-making earlier this year.
The introduction of a distribution rider and a purchased power capacity rider coupled with the transmission rider already authorized would provide industry Texas' additional tools similar to those in place in other jurisdictions that efficiently and effectively promote the public interest and align shareholder and customer economic interests.
If final rules are adopted ETI has the opportunity to file for 1 or more of the 3 riders in 2012 depending on circumstances related to a more complete review of overall cost.
The utility also continued to execute its capital investment commitments related to last year's resource selections in the summer 2009 long-term request for proposal.
In June Entergy Louisiana filed a request seeking Louisiana Public Service Commission approval to construct the 550-megawatt Ninemile 6 combined-cycle plant.
The total project cost is estimated at $721 million excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades.
Under the current proposed structure Entergy Louisiana would own the plant retain 55% of the energy and capacity and sell the balance under a life-of-the-unit power purchase agreement to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans.
The June LPSC filing also requested approval for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to enter into the PPA for its 25% share of the output of Ninemile 6.
Entergy New Orleans also filed with the City Council seeking authorization to purchase 20% under its life-of-unit PPA with Entergy Louisiana.
LPSC approval was requested by January 2012 in order to issue full notice to proceed and maintain the construction scheduled for a targeted commercial operations date by the summer of 2015.
Regulatory filings were also submitted seeking acquisition approval and rider recovery upon transaction closing for the 620 megawatt Hot Spring power plant in Arkansas and a 450-megawatt Hinds power plant in Mississippi.
Closing on both acquisitions is targeted for mid-2012 subject to receive federal and state approvals and other closing conditions.
In transmission on May 12 utility operating companies each filed reports detailing the rationale for joining the Midwest ISO.
Total net production cost savings range from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion compared to $0.8 billion to $1.1 billion by joining the Southwest Power Pool over the 10-year period from 2013 to 2022 compared to the status quo.
Production cost savings are projected to be realized for customers in all operating companies.
The reports emphasized the known benefits to our customers that a mature functioning large Day 2 market.
Then on July 1 FERC issued an order on the joint operating agreement between SPP and MISO that confirmed additional power flow between MISO and Entergy would be available over and above the 1 000-megawatt interconnection assumed in the cost benefit analysis.
That's the amortized [ph] that you often hear about.
At issue was whether the joint operating agreement allowed sharing of available transmission capacity often called loop flows between MISO SPP and Entergy Arkansas in the event Entergy Arkansas joins MISO.
FERC found consistent with past FERC policy that if Entergy Arkansas joins MISO the joint operating agreement will allow market flows between MISO and the Entergy system across the interconnected SPP member facilities or the shared flow gate.
While additional details may be resolved between MISO and SPP on compensation matters FERC's decision on the JOA and the ability to utilize surrounding transmission lines above the 1000-megawatt interconnection previously assumed for purposes of a conservative analysis will only serve to increase the potential benefit for joining MISO.
Beyond the clear economic benefits of MISO other factors favored MISO over the alternatives.
It's mature operating Day 2 market larger geography load and generation resources scale and diversity and transition cost allocation policies that are better aligned with our principles on cost causation.
For years we have advocated the efficiency of the cost causation principle despite -- what we'd often call participant funding despite pressures to move to a more cost allocation based tariff or what others call rolled-in rates.
Speaking about FERC order 1000 after its July 1 issuance FERC Chairman Wellinghof stated that a fundamental principle of the new rule is that if there are no benefits there will be no cost allocated.
FERC's policy deploying cost allocation to be roughly commensurate with the benefits is more aligned with the efficiency and equity of cost causation principles and should provide the protection for our customers similar to those that we have long fought for.
However the effectiveness of the new rule will depend on how it is implemented in the various regions.
Since the May 12 filings utilities have continued to participate in technical conferences and meetings and have provided additional details on the analysis as requested by regulators.
The Arkansas Public Service Commission has a hearing scheduled for September and the docket addressing the system agreement and MISO.
Joining MISO marks a significant transformation of the Entergy system providing greater independence transparencies and efficiencies addressing the exit of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi from the system agreement as well as providing substantial benefits to our customers contributing to the ability to maintain affordable rates for Entergy's utility customers.
Utility continues to target a system wide cut over to MISO by December 2013.
Moving on to Entergy wholesale commodities.
Starting with Vermont Yankee.
Last Monday we announced that Entergy's Board of Directors voted to proceed with the October refueling outage.
This decision followed the board's careful deliberation on the merits of the case we filed and the arguments put forth by all parties at the preliminary injunction hearing conducted in June.
The court has put this case on an accelerated schedule for a mid-September trial on the merits of the case.
Given that we are in litigation that's about all we can say about that for the time being.
However even with this expedited trial schedule this litigation could well continue for an extended period of time given the potential for appeals to the Second Circuit and a writ to the U.S.
Supreme Court as many have speculated where this will all ultimately end.
Turning to matters in New York.
Progress continues on the regulatory front related to license renewal.
The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board issued rulings in July continuing its work to determine the issues that will be the subject of hearings and the NRC staff determined that a supplement to the safety evaluation report is wanted to document their updated safety reviews.
As a result hearings at the ASLB likely will not occur earlier than mid-2012 with further delays possible given the complexity of the issues and the number of parties involved.
In June we filed notice with the NRC that the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation had not issued a final decision on our water quality certificate application within the 1-year timeframe required by law.
The significance of this is simply that if the NRC agrees that a waiver has occurred then a new water quality certification is not a requirement for the NRC's issuance at Indian Point's renewed license but it does not change the need to comply with the New York State water quality standards which are already subject to proceeding on the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit or SPDES where the cooling tower versus sludge water screen issues are being addressed.
Although the SPDES process protects water quality it is not linked to the NRC license renewal process like the water quality certificate process did.
The ALJ's plan to move forward with the joint preceding for both the water quality certificate and SPDES pending the waiver by the NRC hearing some several issues are now expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Written testimony on the first round of issues was filed July 22 so that process is underway.
Final decisions by the EEC on these trial matters representing a subset of issues in the SPDES proceedings  are estimated up to be 2 years away and it could go beyond that.
Like the likely extended timeframe to resolve issues on the Indian Point's license renewal effort yesterday we signed a contract extension with Con Ed for a 500 megawatts of capacity in Entergy out of Indian Point units 2 and 3.
The terms of the PPA prevent us from sharing all the details.
However we can tell you date of the contract is in the contingent and contingent on  license renewal for a 5-year term extending through 2017 and contains market-based pricing mechanisms within a predetermined range committing low-cost energy to Westchester in New York City while allowing Entergy to meet its goals of hedging energy volumes in periods after license current license expirations.
The vital role of Indian Point in the region was clear in a draft report prepared by the Charles Rivers Associates for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection.
Key findings of scenarios without the Indian Point included: Higher wholesale electric cost to consumers beginning at $1.5 billion each year and after consideration of subsidies for uneconomic replacements and likely higher -- lower carbon levels higher costs quickly rise to over $2 billion per year.
The loss of 1 100 direct jobs and associated ancillary jobs supporting the plant substantial grid reliability issues and increased air pollution estimated at 15% more carbon emissions and 7% to 8% more NOx.
Underscoring these results was released by the EPA in early July of its final rule on cost state air pollution.
While we cannot say that we completely understand how EPA did its modeling and believe me we've tried or that we agree with the results or the challenges are not likely by a number of parties this rule is now final.
However based upon where we stand today in our reading of the rule New York will need to reduce its summer season NOx emissions by at least 44% assuming purchase of emission offsets in other states and by 54% without those offset purchases.
This summer ozone fees [ph] in 2010 Indian Point provided over 7 million-megawatt hours of NOx-free generation.
New York will also have to reduce its annual NOx and SO2 emissions.
Any emissions in excess of allowed amounts in the state could expose the generators to maximum penalties of $37 500 per ton per day.
And I would emphasize that's per ton per day and that's a big number.
And the end [ph] requirements to submit extra penalty emission allowances under the Clean Air Act.
We expect the generators will reflect the cost of NOx and SO2 emissions in their bids and also market prices will increase as a result.
Now summing it up for New York.
I know the Indian Point license renewal is of significant interest to everybody.
It is certainly to us.
We believe the arguments for license renewal are very strong and are supported by the facts as evidenced by the water quality certificate filing at the New York State EEC and NRC filing for license renewal.
The NRC process also requires that Indian Point obtains a consistency determination in the New York Department of State under the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act.
Indian Point will file this application in due course and we believe the factual case supports obtaining the CZM consistency determination especially since Indian Point is an existing facility not a new one and since the plant is not seeking permission to change its operations in the coastal zone.
Now perhaps because of the significance of Indian Point or maybe because of the proximity of the plant to many of you that conduct business that reside in New York there have already been considerable rumors speculations and questions that we typically refer to as kind of inside baseball stuff.
There is an unusual amount of digging on questions that typically don't come up until they're much further into the regulatory process when a public record is starting to emerge.
Specifically speculations on the probability of some sort of settlement of the issues that would provide needed direction to both Entergy in operating the plant and the state for long-term energy planning.
We agree that it would make a lot of sense for everyone given the importance of Indian Point to the energy environmental needs of New York and the surrounding areas.
As a point-of-view company we always had a position on the various issues individually or in total and an economic valuation of what makes sense for our stakeholders at any point in time.
Protracted litigation is always an option but due to the inherent uncertainty and the cost the certainty equivalent between a settlement and protracted litigation produce different results in our analysis utilizing sophisticated decision risk analysis and statistical techniques and the best judgments of experts in each area.
In other words some sort of commercial agreement among all the parties is always the preferred option.
On the other hand when the parties cannot find common ground then we are always prepared to not only rely on the regulatory review process to make our case but exhaust court appeals as necessary to secure a fair or reasonable outcome.
In Vermont we went down various paths to achieve a fair and reasonable outcome but the nonnegotiable demand from the state to shut down the plant in March 2012 despite the NRC license renewal until 2032 gave us no choice but to seek relief in Federal Court.
In New York it is well known and we disclosed the fact that it's been our process that we offered a number of options to the state in order to meet their objectives and still achieve our business objectives including a more efficient structure to own the non-utility nuclear assets.
In the end the states' demands on Entergy would have been a step backward in terms of our economic efficiency goals compared to the structure we already have in place.
We relied on the regulatory process and as you know we did not succeed.
And we chose not to appeal to the courts in that instance.
In other words our record supports the fact we practice what we preach.
We are a dynamic emphasis on dynamic point-of-view company and essentially everything has a price that is everything except our ethics in plating gray areas of the wall like disclosure issues.
Having said that it is neither appropriate nor advisable to discuss any issue related to any dialogue or any what if that is not part of the public record in the various regulatory processes.
We will not answer questions on things like whether we have talked to a certain party the positions of the company on various issues or whether they are negotiable or speculate on other positions or disclose those positions we think we [ph] might become aware of them.
Or any other question that could fuel speculation or create mistrust or otherwise interfere with the regulatory process.
Like I said there have already been a lot of questions or observations that start to feel like almost reverse psychology in order to solicit responses in areas where we have had a long-held policy of not speculating on.
I know there will be a lot more misinformation or rumors with the renewal process duration but to selectively respond to anyone in particular despite how much we might want to given the nature of the rumor is a slippery slope that we are determined to stay off.
So you're going to get a lot of no-comments on questions in that area.
Our no-comment will not stop others from speculating but it will not fuel those rumors.
I just ask that you trust that we always have your best interest clearly in focus and we have an open mind on how to best protect and promote that.
You all love certainly who doesn't with the exception of maybe some option traders out there.
But unfortunately we cannot provide that to you today.
But we are very early in the process and to see things typically unfold sometime seems is better.
At Pilgrim we're pleased to report the completion of 2 open items requiring resolution report of the renewal process and renewed license can be issued.
First in June 30.
The NRC staff issued the supplement and safety evaluation report completing the additional safety review of the license renewal application.
Then 2 weeks ago the ASLB issued the decision rejecting on re-amp [ph] from the NRC last year the only admitted contingent remaining before them.
An appeal of this rejection by the ASLB is possible and other late-file contingents remain outstanding.
However the NRC regulations allow for the issuance of Pilgrim's 20-year license renewal while any appeals for late file contingents are pending.
Before closing I would remind you of the utility's extraordinary effort to respond to winter storms tornadoes and floods affecting all aspects of operations this year.
Efforts include protecting generating units along the Mississippi River from potential flooding post-monitoring of transmission facilities to keep targeted lines in operation and restoring approximately 216 000 customer outages from multiple storms primarily in Arkansas and Mississippi.
Not only are our employees the best at responding to these challenges but they did so more safely than ever with the fewest number of recordable accidents over any 6-month period in the company's entire history.
The utility is well prepared and battle tested as we face the peak of the hurricane season ahead.
Lastly in nuclear operations in May the Nuclear Energy Institute announced the top -- 2 of the top industry practice awards recognized in safety innovations for 2 of Entergy's nuclear plants.
Scrutiny of the safety of the nuclear industry has never been greater and our employees throughout the company continue to show they are committed and up to the task.
And now I will turn the call over to Leo.
Thank you Wayne and good morning everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover quarterly financial results and cash performance an update of our share repurchase program our 2011 earnings guidance and then I'll share a few closing thoughts on our long-term financial outlook.
Starting with our financial results on Slide 2.
Second quarter 2011 earnings were higher than 1year ago at both the Utility and Parent &amp; Other while they were lower at EWC.
Second quarter earnings included accretion from share repurchases the lower share count is due to the effect of repurchases completed in both 2010 and 2011 including initiation of repurchases against the $500 million program during the quarter.
Higher utility results were driven by sales growth across all customer classes including the effect of warmer-than-normal weather.
Overall retail sales growth on a weather-adjusted basis was also higher than last year driven by continued strength in the industrial sector.
Parent &amp; Other results were higher on the reversal of the tax reserve and at EWC lower power pricing continue to affect results.
Turning now to the details driving quarter-over-quarter results.
At the utility Slide 3 shows higher net revenue as 1 factor driving the quarterly earnings increase.
Overall retail sales grew by 2.9% and for the second year in a row weather was a significant factor.
In Entergy service territory cooling degree days were 38% above normal for the second quarter.
The region's temperatures ranked second hottest in the 117 years of available data for the second quarter.
Texas and Louisiana temperatures were especially warm ranking first and second respectively.
And June was particularly warm across the service territory with stations averaging at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit above the monthly norm.
Residential sales grew 3.7% but decreased slightly on a weather-adjusted basis.
While the number of residential customers increased to 0.7% the usage per customer on a weather-adjusted basis declined.
The trend of increasing industrial sales continued with 2.8% growth this quarter.
Industrial expansions in Texas and Louisiana contribute to about 40% of the total industrial increase Texas issuing the strongest growth of all jurisdictions especially in the industrial sector.
Recent reports from the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank noted a positive outlook for refiners and petrochemical companies along the Gulf Coast.
Also on a positive note consumer confidence in the West South Central region which includes Texas Louisiana and Arkansas ranked first in overall confidence among the 9 regions in the United States.
These bright spots were partially offset by weakening in small industrials as well as paper and wood products segments.
These trends have affected Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi which saw a decrease in industrial sales compared to strong results in 2010.
Regulatory actions in 2010 also contributed to this quarter's net revenue increase including rate adjustments in Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas partially offset by a formula rate plan decrease at Entergy New Orleans.
Also contributing to the utilities earnings increase was lower interest expense more than $1.3 billion of refinancings have been executed at an average coupon of 4.6% a decline of over 100 basis points.
As of June 30 the weighted average coupon rate for the utilities debt portfolio was 5.6% or 30 basis points lower than last year.
Moving on to EWC.
The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operational earnings was due primarily to lower net revenue and a higher effective income tax rate.
Net revenue for EWC's portfolio declined as the result of lower energy and capacity pricing.
For the EWC nuclear fleet the average realized price for the second quarter of this year was $52.38 per megawatt hour or 9% lower than last year.
Capacity pricing has also declined over the last several years due to low demand conditions driven by recession coupled with a degree of energy efficiency programs success and high levels of demand response.
The collapse has been most severe over the last 12 months in New York.
For example monthly spot prices in New York's rest of state zone ranged from $0.15 to $0.65 per kilowatt month in the second quarter this year compared to $0.64 to $3.52 a year ago.
The August spot auction for New York rest of state came out a few days ago at just about $0.05 per kilowatt month.
A major driver that has affected New York capacity market over the last 2 months and which will continue to affect in-city and the rest of state prices unless otherwise resolved has been the addition of roughly 550 megawatts from the story of 2 but has not been mitigated as expected.
There has been some discussion about creating a new capacity zone in New York for the Lower Hudson Valley area.
Potentially by the summer of 2014 such a development could improve capacity pricing for our Indian Point units longer term.
Other help in the capacity markets will likely come over several years from retirement of certain generators that currently rely heavily on capacity revenue and were facing increased environmental compliance costs going forward.
Also these little capacity values may drive a retrenchment of load response programs or at least slow their growth.
System load growth remains a wild card but there is some possible upside compared to New York's current load forecast which are projected to remain below 2010 levels until 2014.
Operationally the nuclear fleet produced a 91% capacity factor slightly higher than the second quarter last year.
This capacity factor improvement is due to 8 fuel refueling outage days this year.
Non-refueling outage days were comparable quarter-over-quarter.
A higher effective income tax rate at EWC also contributed to the lower earnings.
In May the State of Michigan enacted legislation that repealed its business tax replacing it with a corporate income tax.
The new tax law which will be effective January 1 2012 eliminates the future deduction which was available for certain book and tax differences.
Given that this deduction was no longer available EWC wrote off the related deferred tax asset.
Finally Parent &amp; Other results were higher this quarter due primarily to lower income tax expense on parent and other activities.
The lower tax expense is attributed to the reversal of the tax reserve which results from a settlement of an uncertain tax position.
Our 2011 guidance assumes a 35% effective income tax rate and the tax reserve adjustment recorded this quarter is consistent with that guidance assumption.
Moving now to Slide 4.
Entergy's operating cash flow performance for second quarter this year reflected a decrease of approximately $140 million compared to the second quarter of 2010.
This decrease in OCF was driven mainly by 2 factors: Lower deferred fuel cost collections and the previously discussed decrease in Entergy's wholesale commodities net revenue.
I'll now turn to an update on our share repurchase program as reflected on Slide 5.
During the second quarter we completed roughly $105 million of share repurchases.
We purchased a total of 1.4 million shares at an average price of $68 per share.
About 75% of the repurchases were made through the existing $500 million board authorized program.
The balance was repurchased to offset the dilutive effects of grant exercises.
At the end of last quarter $425 million remained on the existing $500 million program.
Consistent with past practice decisions on whether to buy back stock will be based on a number of factors including current business conditions and investment needs our liquidity and financial flexibility to quickly respond to changing conditions or opportunities particularly since we are approaching the peak of hurricane season and our point of view on the value of our stock.
Slide 6 details our current 2011 earnings guidance which ranges from $6.35 to $6.85 per share on both an as-reported and operational basis.
The guidance range remains unchanged from the numbers we initiated last October.
As we assess our earnings performance to date we believe we have made good progress through the first half of 2011 and earnings have benefited from favorable weather.
Consequently we are well positioned relative to our full-year guidance range.
For the rest of the year efforts will focus on continuing to produce positive financial results through strong operational performance.
Consistent with our past practice we normally will affirm or revise guidance on a quarterly basis and will revise guidance only when we see factors that move our expectations outside of the overall range we have previously provided.
In closing I'd like to touch on 2 topics.
First I'll make a few comments about our EWC sold forward table in the release then I'll touch on our long-term financial outlook looking ahead to next year and beyond.
On Slide 7 we've summarized information from our EWC nuclear sold forward table on Page 5 of the release.
This quarter we have included a range for the average energy contract revenue per megawatt hour rather than a specific price point.
The range takes into account contracts with the collar like the recent extension of the power purchase agreement with Con Ed that Wayne mentioned earlier.
The lower end of the range reflects contract floors and the upper end contract ceilings.
At the bottom of Table 6 the average contract revenue per megawatt hour which includes both capacity and energy revenues reflects the price that the contacts would settle assuming current forward market prices.
Slide 8 outlines key aspects of Entergy's long-term financial outlook.
Starting with the utility we continue to see the long-term growth outlook consistent with the 6% to 8% compound average growth rate through 2014 off the 2009 base year net income.
One thing to note is the changes in utility net income can be lumpy due to several factors including weather and sales growth timing of capital investments and regulatory actions.
All of these items do not occur evenly from year to year.
For EWC we expect declining revenues as price trends for energy and capacity play out over the next few years in both sold and unsold volumes.
As we outlined in Table 6 in the release assuming current contracts and forward markets for EWC nuclear output average prices decrease in 2012 and again in 2013 before recovery starts in 2014.
Long-term EWC offers a valuable option on positive effects of ongoing economic growth and environmental regulation.
Parent &amp; Other can vary from year to year.
Parent interest expense depends on the label of borrowing as well as the cost of debt given the range of possible private and public financing options and the timing of their execution.
An income tax expense can fluctuate with resolution of unresolved income tax issues.
Our capital deployment philosophy focuses on maintaining a balanced investment and capital return program.
Our capital plan includes expenditures to support continued safe and reliable operations as well as value-added productive investments.
We also plan to maintain a capital return program which includes common stock dividends and share repurchases.
Our current long-term outlook remains to return up to $4 billion to $5 billion to shareholders from 2012 through 2014.
As we move into the next quarter we recognize that many of you will continue to fine-tune your estimates for the coming year and beyond.
In that regard we have provided additional details on key business drivers in the appendix of this webcast presentation.
Our overarching aspiration remains top quartile total shareholder return.
Conditions in the commodity markets in the interim uncertainties for the full agenda of strategic initiatives that Wayne reviewed earlier have left us well short of these aspirations in recent years.
Nevertheless the management team continues to focus on delivering results that will create tangible long-term value we can return to you the financial yardstick of our success.
To that end we will continue to focus on safety operational excellence risk management and disciplined capital deployment to maximize the value of our company.
And now the Entergy team is available for your questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.
On the water permit if the NRC doesn't agree to the waiver and if the water permit actually is denied what would be the next steps? I'll let Rod West take it.
If the water permit is denied by the State of New York the remedy available to the company would be to appeal it.
And can the plant operate I guess while that's going on? I mean I guess that's the case with Vermont Yankee.
If you guys -- if the case doesn't go your way in Vermont or New York while it's under appeal these plants can still operate is that right? Right.
And a particular note I'll make note of the term the timely filed doctrine that allows the plants to continue to operate assuming that the facility has sought relicensing from NRC at least 5 years prior to plant expiration.
And in the case of New York our point of view is that that timely filed doctrine would apply that will allow the plant to continue operating while we are resolving issues you just raised.
Okay great.
And then just on the capacity markets in the Northeast.
We've seen Astoria in Ravenswood file for emergency -- I don't know a petition to FERC I guess to basically have market mitigation buyer side market power mitigation.
And we're seeing efforts in New England by generators to do the same.
Do you guys see the potential for I guess ISO activity to potentially raise the capacity market by going after these out-of-market revenue generators? Yes Paul.
I mean we're part of many of those proceedings both as a member of the ISOs but also at FERC.
So I think it's going to play out over the next year or so both within the ISOs and then also eventually at FERC.
And in fact you've seen preliminary rulings coming out of FERC on PJM on the same issue.
Right.
So what kind of -- can you give us an idea about what you think might happen in terms of capacity pricing in the Northeast as a result of this? Any sense? I mean I know it's kind of foggy right now but...
Well I mean if the mitigation takes place I mean as Leo went through the details of what's going on in the quarter and both of those markets --  I mean the prices are depressed.
So with the market mitigation they are anywhere from 75% to 80% of what their new built cost is is what they have to bid into.
So logically that's going to increase those capacity prices.
Right.
And any sense as to how much maybe? Or is that too preliminary? I think it's too preliminary.
And we'll move next to Daniel Eggers from Crédit Suisse.
Without trying to pin you down on your kind of questions you won't answer are there some external data points we should be following as far as New York's concerned maybe the monitor discussions you're having or the process outside of your kind of the more obvious New York decisions on the water permit? Well there will be.
But I think having the water quality permit as we're saying today -- is probably about as maybe front and center as far as options or direction that we may go ahead going forward.
Again I hesitate to get into it.
It's still in the process.
For reasons that I just outlined and I apologize I can't at this point but it just wouldn't be advisable.
But I'd say on the water quality permit and in particular the issue there that we just discussed while it's not approved the question there that you have to keep in mind is is it headed toward a conditional approval or rather than rejection putting cooling towers versus flat rejection or condition upon something else.
And I'm just following those hearings versus making assumption that it's an up-or-down rejection or proceed.
Other than that I'm not sure I can help you at this point.
As time passes we'll keep you updated with those things that we feel comfortable commenting on that are part of the public record but today there isn't much.
Okay that's fair.
And then just on the hedging philosophy right now there's a big step-up in your percentage of generation that was sold for 2013 with the contracting.
How should we think about kind of the strategy on filling out '13 and maybe looking out at '14 to '15 what you guys would expect as far as selling more of that power output? Dan this is Leo.
We're pretty comfortable with the levels we are right now.
We're going to continue to execute on the hedging strategy based on the limits we put in place and our point of view about around the market.
Obviously we have limits that are based on things like financial policy and liquidity and credit ratings and the like.
And we're in pretty good shape where we stand right now for where we want to be.
We've had to spend a lot of time figuring out the right way to hedge going forward.
As Wayne mentioned the idea of hedging out beyond the current licenses is one that we have to make sure that we put additional risk management structures around and we do that first before we make any transaction decisions.
But right now we'll really be just basing it on what our point of view is going forward in the markets and where we think things are going to go.
And just to make sure so the -- the out year numbers the '14 '15 those hedge pieces are effective in the Midwest plants plus kind of the Indian Point contract with Con Ed is that a fair representation of mix of what's captured so far? Yes majority yes.
Okay.
And just one last question just on the Cooper plant is there any exposure to you guys given the flooding issues there as far as maybe additional spending or impact on payments they make to you guys running the plant? Gary? Yes Dan.
No there's no impact.
The plant did very well during the flooding issue and we're continuing to watch actually the river has already crept.
It is already declining and the plant actually did very well so we don't see any impact there.
And we'll take the next question from Ashar Khan from Visium.
Leo if I want to go back to the slides that was in your guidance for this year there was a $0.62 negative variance for the weather.
And so based on what you provided in the release you're up like $0.02 if I'm right on weather year-over-year.
So I'm I correct we are running nearly like -- based on what you provided last year for this year we're running like $0.64 ahead as we stand on weather for 2011 versus '10 as a positive thing? Well we haven't done third quarter yet Ashar.
So third quarter is really kind of as you know for us given the location of our service territory third quarter is a big quarter for us.
Make or break us either way.
We can have weather that's below normal cooling degree days or above normal cooling degree days.
So yes we're running pretty comparable to where we were last year which is a pretty big year both in the winter and the summer but until we get through the third quarter I wouldn't declare weather closed in the books yet one way or the other.
And obviously we always go back at the end of the year when we get ready to do next year's guidance and we'll adjust acting on the weather for next year as well.
And my second question if I can ask what was -- can you -- what was the average purchase price for the shares that were purchased in the second quarter? About $68.
Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman from Bank of America.
A couple of questions.
Is there any sense of timing or schedule on the NRC ruling on your water permit filing? All right Chuck.
Steve this is Chuck.
No.
There's really not -- there's not any pressure on the NRC to make a ruling on that really until they get much closer to the actual ruling on our license renewal application.
Okay.
This is the waiver issue correct? The waiver issue for Indian Point.
Will they take comments and  other stuff as part of that so we'll know there's a process? Or will it just suddenly come out one day? I don't know the answer to that.
We've made our filing.
There had been responses filed with the NRC by the DEC and by the River Keeper.
But what their process going forward will be we really have not been informed.
Okay.
And then Wayne I'll do my best to try and interpret what you're trying to say but maybe I kind of read it as you were just going to hear a lot of things over this period and hearing a lot of things early on.
I guess one thing you're trying to say look if in the end it makes sense for shareholders to settle on issues just to let us know that you're going to be looking at what's the best risk return option I guess.
That's right Steve.
And you're very plugged in as you always are to a lot of these rumors.
And I think what's really kind of precipitated a lot of this is it would make a lot of sense I mean for both parties to come together.
And it was something that will give directions and stay in direction to us.
Obviously that makes sense.
In the process of posturing sometimes things get into the press that are just not true or whatever and we can't comment on those kind of things.
And then in the process of trade presses and others trying to get more information as you've seen there are rumors speculations that have been leaked us back and postured or we've been positioned as not willing to consider certain things and that's not true.
I mean as you've known over the years we've spent -- some people in this room have spent careers at negotiating tables.
Sometimes it's turned out well and sometimes we have had deadlocked but that is our preferred position.
And in this case it would be a preferred outcome.
But it has to make commercial sense.
And I guess the point that we're trying to make is just a -- not  a warning we don't need to warn you all but just -- there will be a lot of things out there that just aren't true.
And we would like to respond to them but that will only get -- Like I said create distrust among a lot of parties and we don't have the best record in New York already coming out of an excess [ph] spin in terms of trust and things of that nature.
And we're trying to rebuild that and commenting on these rumors they always -- the  words get turned around and things and we're going to stay away from that.
But we are -- like you kind of described we do continue to develop scenarios that would be in the best interest versus protracted litigation and we're open to ideas in any of these processes.
Then hopefully it won't have to go the whole nine innings here.
Okay.
One last quick thing I guess for Leo.
Just on the data on the hedges with the collars.
You might have said this and I missed it but a current forward or something like that would you be at the low end of the collar on these? Or...
They'd be probably in the middle end of them at the moment.
Okay.
So probably the best thing is to assume middle and then if things get a lot better it's higher and if things get worse it's lower.
Correct.
But if you look in the table where we get down to the bottom of that table where we put in the percent sold on the total revenue basis it's got capacity and energy in it.
The energy portion of that is at what we would settle at today if it was the forward curve.
In that bottom section of the table where we present percent sold on a revenue basis that includes all of the revenue including capacity.
That estimate is a single point and that single point is used in today's forward curve to settle point.
And we'll move next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.
Firstly to follow up on the questions on the nuclear side.
The ASLB had previously issued a release suggesting it anticipated resolving the Pilgrim renewal by the end of July 2011.
Is there any new comparable date we should be looking out for? Is there any kind of defined or prescribed timeline at this point in the process? Rod? Currently end of year 2011.
Great.
And then secondly could you comment briefly on your efforts to renew the FRPs in Louisiana changes that you suggested that could be a potential new rate case filing in the state? Okay Gary? Yes we made our last filing for this 3-year term with the FRP in May and those rates going into effect in September.
And so at this point we will continue to work with the staff.
We intend to work to continue those FRPs and renew those for another term.
They've been very efficient they work well for our customers and for owners.
So you would anticipate resolving the FRP renewal by September or in the next couple of months? Really they're 2 different issues.
If you look at the filing that rates went in will go into effect in September.
So we will need to obviously have that approved by the LPSC and our intent to resolve the FRP as far as renewals hopefully by the time we would re-file in May of next year.
Great.
And then thirdly can you just quickly discuss the potential for a Texas rate case in light of the latest legislation et cetera? Yes if you look at Texas and in all of our jurisdictions I mean one of the fundamentals in our plan is that each of our businesses earn their authorized return.
The average in Texas as Wayne talked about it's come to fruition especially the capacity rider will help us do a lot of that.
The capacity rider may require us to require to file a base rate case just to set the baseline.
We've already done that for transmission and we proactively already did that for distribution in our last rate case.
Although we look significantly at where that is that's the biggest pressure on it and depending on where they are with relation to ROEs and whether we get these riders done will require whether or not we file a rate case which we can do each year in Texas.
We'll take the next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
You've talked at length about cross-states rule and the impact on the non-regulated side.
Just curious how are you thinking about what it means for the regulated side of the business in terms of potential rate base growth opportunities in terms of your Arkansas coal plant that may need scrubbing et cetera? Okay.
This is a complicated question.
I'm going to start with -- let Rod talk about kind of how it affects spend side and I'll let Gary follow up specifically on how we're thinking about how it affects the business plan.
Good.
The first part of the tag team is we're assessing the impact on the rule.
Obviously the issues for us stem around timing where the EPA prior to what we knew was the transport rule before this funding by the EPA had -- we were assuming a 2014 effective date.
We've now moved up under the rules to 2012.
That certainly had an impact.
And then when you combine the notion of allowances all of those affect our perspective cost of compliance.
And certainly the fines.
On the regulated did side of the fence which Gary can talk to obviously there are assumptions made by the EPA regarding the retirement of plants in our regulated space quite candidly that are needed whether it's reliability purposes transmission of baseload load following ready much-run designation.
And there's a lot that we have to do to try and assess where that is and it's a dynamic process for us.
We're just not at a point right now where we're taking a firm company point of view because we ultimately have to determine what this means for our customers and that's an iterative conversation with the regulators.
Gary? Well I'll actually cover it Michael probably in 2 parts.
The first is really there's mechanisms for environmental cost recoveries the SOx and NOx in each of our jurisdictions.
In the case of EGSL and NOI there are environmental adjustment riders that are available to cover those costs as well as through Arkansas post service the APSC and the NPSC and the public utility commission Texas all that's recovered through fuel.
The rule is new is I think what you just heard from Rod and changed significantly from what we saw and expected in 2014.
So we are in the process of actually evaluating what would have to be done to each of those plants.
In each case there are technological solutions that would require some capital investment.
We've not gone far enough down the rule this road to really say what those are.
We knew what they were going to be.
We didn't think they will be significant as it existed under 2014 and what was the proposed rule.
We believe though our initial look we're looking forward to it that we would still be able to make those investments.
As Rod said those plants are reliability much run and I think we're going to be able to do that and in a cost-effective way.
But I think that's going to be more evolved as we're studying it right now because it's fairly new.
We have no further questions at this time.
I'd like to turn the conference back to Ms.
Paula Waters for any additional or closing remarks.
Thank you and thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G combined statements.
Our call is recorded and can be accessed for the next 7 days by dialing (719) 457-0820 replay code 8424061.
This concludes our call.
Thank you.
And again that does conclude today's presentation.
Thank you for your participation.
Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time for introductions and opening comments I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead ma'am.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Wayne Leonard; and then Leo Denault our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] After the Q&amp;A session I will close with the applicable legal statements.
Wayne? Okay.
Thanks Paula.
Good morning everybody.
We know many of you are preparing for the EEI Conference next week.
Many other companies in our sector are reporting this week also.
With that in mind our comments will be brief at least relatively brief for us and limited to quarterly results and recent events.
We will discuss strategic issues with you at EEI.
Starting at the Utility on October 28 the Arkansas Public Service Commission issued an order in its Show Cause proceeding on post-system agreement transition issues for Entergy Arkansas.
In its order the APSC decided that it is prudent for Entergy Arkansas to join a Regional Transmission Organization.
However the commission did not make a determination on the question of which RTO is in the best interest of Entergy Arkansas and its ratepayers.
The Midwest Independent System Operator option or the Southwest Power Pool RTO option.
A decision on which RTO to join was not the original subject of this docket which was opened in February 2010 and as such the APSC deferred any determination on Entergy Arkansas' proposal to join MISO until the company files an application to transfer operational control of its transmission facilities to MISO.
The APSC order provides helpful guidance on the upcoming changes [indiscernible]  Filing that Entergy Arkansas will make in the next 30 days.
Similar changes of control filings will be made in the other retail regulatory jurisdictions by year end starting with yesterday's filing with the Louisiana Public Service Commission.
Upon its exit from the System Agreement Entergy Arkansas proposed to join MISO which would provide it as well as the other utility operating companies more benefits from the commitment and dispatch of a larger system than currently provided by the System Agreement.
These benefits derived from joining in an RTO with substantial scale and a Day 2 market.
As you know Day 2 refers to an RTO that includes day ahead and realtime energy markets.
MISO has a functioning Day 2 market today that will generate savings for the customers on Day 1 SPP does not.
Even though cost benefit analysis completed to date optimistically assumes SPP will have one by December 2013 both schedule and cost are highly uncertain particularly in light of the challenges other RTOs have experienced in transitioning to Day 2 markets.
Even assuming an operational Day 2 market in SPP MISO is expected to provide 25% greater benefits than SPP.
The System Agreement was the subject of another ruling late last month by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission related to its 2005 bandwidth decision.
FERC's 2005 decision established a requirement that each utility-operating company's production cost be roughly equal within plus or minus 11% of system average production cost and set 2007 as the first year for payments based upon production costs for calendar year 2006.
In its latest order the FERC rejected our arguments to require refunds for a 20-month period spanning September 2001 through May 2003.
However the FERC concluded the bandwidth remedy should have been implemented sooner by calculating bandwidth remedy payments and receipts for the 7th month period starting June 1 2005 the date of FERC's initial order rather than January 1 2006.
We're currently reviewing the order and are in the process of calculating the amount of payments required between utility-operating companies.
As is the case with bandwidth remedy receipts these payment receipts will be calculated based upon the detailed formula prescribed by the FERC staff.
It is likely the effect of moving up the implementation date to the bandwidth remedy will result in additional payments from Entergy Arkansas.
But as a reminder Entergy Arkansas has an existing rider approved by the APSC that provides full recovery of costs resulting from the FERC 2005 orders and any subsequent modifications of these orders.
Immediately after the FERC order on rehearing in late 2005 Entergy Arkansas gave the required 96 months notice of its withdrawal from the System Agreement.
That exit is now 26 months away and Entergy Arkansas is actively preparing for this exit.
In another development relating to the proposed move to MISO a FERC ruling in late September provided important procedural guidance regarding the path forward for obtaining certainty on key issues affecting the operating companies' participation in MISO.
At issue was a transitional waiver requested by MISO regarding proposed transmission cost allocation provisions associated with Entergy's integration into MISO.
The FERC concluded that the waiver request was not the appropriate vehicle for obtaining FERC approval for the proposed provisions.
Instead these type of provisions should be sought through specific tariff changes and accompanied by additional detail.
MISO recently made public the proposed tariff changes and is currently working through its stakeholder process to finalize and file the appropriate changes.
This approach will provide greater clarity for Entergy's retail regulators and customers with the cost allocation policies that will be in effect for the operating companies' customers as they integrate into MISO.
In other regulatory events at the utility formula rate plan filings for the 2010 test year were resolved in Louisiana and New Orleans.
At Entergy New Orleans the city council approved a settlement that will result in a $13.1 million reduction in electric rates and a $1.6 million reduction in gas rates effective the first billing cycle on October.
This is the fourth straight year of rate reductions due in part to continued sales strength from the city's rebirth following Hurricane Katrina as well as unseasonable weather in 2010.
The average residential electric rate for Entergy New Orleans customers is now more than 22% below 2008 levels.
Also last month Louisiana Public Service Commission approved formula rate plan reports for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana resolving their 2010 test year filings.
The final reports reflect 2010 earnings consistent with each company's authorized bandwidth returns resulting in no cost of service changes.
However the LPSC deferred to its November meeting motion for a one-year extension of the formula rate plans through the 2011 test year as proposed by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.
As part of the proposed extension each of the Louisiana companies indicated that they would file a full rate case by May of 2013 primarily to determine cost of service rate classes and the appropriate rate structure.
This time we will also allow considerations of any potential rate-making issues associated with the proposed transition to MISO.
And in Texas after completing an overall review of costs Entergy Texas submitted a notice last week to the cities in its jurisdiction of its intent to file a rate case.
The rate case is expected to be filed by year-end and under Texas law a final decision is due within 185 days of filing.
Wrapping up at the Utility.
In October Entergy filed for review for a stay and implementation of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or Casper in the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
In addition Entergy filed directly with the EPA to request a delay an implementation and reconsideration of the basis for the final rule.
Numerous utility states and other parties also filed challenges for Casper including the public service commissions in Louisiana and Mississippi and the state of Texas.
We believe the rule is well-intended but seriously flawed due to insufficient modeling capability and inaccurate inputs to that model.
As a result it incorporates some fundamental errors based upon inappropriate modeling applications that could threaten the utility-operating companies' ability to meet the needs of its customers without subjecting the companies to the risk of large fines for noncompliance.
The primary issue for Entergy is the potential inability to serve our customers and to comply physically from the shortened time length created by the final rule especially if interstate allowance trading is also limited.
Utility-operating companies are still reviewing the rule as well as last month's proposed revisions to the rule.
Specifically items under review include likely allowance pricing unit operations and dispatch options and the potential inflation of pollution-control equipment that can be installed by next summer.
Even with EPA's proposed revisions to the rule the Entergy states are still disadvantaged on allowances.
The revision would be a step in the right direction and is more realistic because it takes into account the necessity for some units around the country to operate due to load pocket needs and transmission constraints even if they don't run in the model that EPA use.
For example it is well-known in our service area that the areas in Amit [ph] south and west of the Atchafalaya Basin or what we call low tab presents substantial service complexity.
They are dead-ended to the south by the Gulf of Mexico and in the case of low tab also to the west by Ertahad [ph].
These constraints limit the amount of power that can be imported into the area and therefore make stable generation by existing facilities in the load area essential to maintaining reliability.
The revised rule would also allow unlimited interstate allowance trading until 2014 that's increasing the liquidity of the allowance market.
However most of the states are still significantly short allowances and methods for compliance are still under review.
As it stands today Casper is effective next year unless the courts issue a stay.
An appeals court decision could take 12 to 18 months.
In the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.
In Vermont a 3-day trial was held in mid-September in our federal lawsuit to block the state from forcing the Vermont Yankee nuclear Plant to close in March of next year despite the fact that the NRC has issued a license to operate for another 20 years.
A ruling by the District Court should be issued at any time now.
However this case is very likely headed to higher courts regardless of the decision.
In New York a hearing before the Administrative Law Judges of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation or the DEC began on October 17.
As we've previously discussed at issue are several matters identified in the Water Quality Certification and water discharge permit proceedings for Indian Point.
Two issues will be covered in the first phase.
The efficacy or performance of our wastewater screen proposal and whether the DEC staff properly denied the WQC application based upon the impact if any of the leakage of radiological material into the groundwater beneath Indian Point.
Future hearing dates have not been set but are expected to resume in December on other issues such as: What impact if any Indian Point has on the stated best use of the Hudson River and any endangered species and the availability of cooling towers as the best technology available.
Final decisions by the DEC could be up to 2 years away and are appealable to a New York state court.
With expiration of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's operating license in September 2013 for Indian Point 2 and December 2015 for Indian Point 3 we are still in early stages of these license renewal processes.
That said the NRC issued a decision early September denying intermediate requests filed in the aftermath of the Fukushima event to suspend the license renewal processes for all plants including those for Pilgrim and Indian Point.
A similar late file contention arising out Fukushima by the Massachusetts Attorney General is the last item appending before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board in Pilgrim's license renewal preceding.
There is no reason to believe that the contention filed in the Pilgrim proceeding is any different from all the other similar requests that have been denied by the NRC.
Appeals by Pilgrim Watch a recent ASLB decision denying contentions they raised also remain outstanding with the NRC.
The NRC stated target for reviewing license renewal applications is within 22 months if there is no hearing and within 30 months if a hearing is required.
That was the case in Pilgrim.
Over the course of more than 69 months the longest license renewal proceeding in history the NRC staff has completed an in-depth review and the ASLB has resolved all admitted contentions.
On the basis of these 2 facts in August we filed a motion that the Pilgrim license renewal is justified under the NRC immediate effectiveness rule and asked the NRC to direct its staff to immediately issue the 20-year license renewal.
The NRC has not ruled on that motion yet.
As it relates to timing the NRC Chairman stated in a letter sent last year to Senator Kerry that NRC regulations permit operation beyond the expiration of the current license yet the final determination on Pilgrim's license renewal application has not yet been made.
That refers to the timely renewal doctrine.
Wrapping up recent developments in EWC last week we announced the acquisition of the Rhode Island State Energy Center a 550-megawatt combined cycle gas fire power plant located in the ISO New England market.
The purchase price was $346 million approximately $593 per kilowatt including a planned 33-megawatt upgrade scheduled for completion prior to acquisition.
Consistent with our disciplined point of view-based strategy this investment add standalone economic value.
But it also starts to diversify EWC's portfolio across fuel type and dispatch merit and provides a valuable backstop against firm sales from Pilgrim or Vermont Yankee thereby reducing unit contingent discounts compared to levels we have experienced in the past.
The economic value of a unit has less to do with the cost to build it or replace it or even comparable units than you might think.
It has more to do with competitive positioning.
How efficient is the unit compared to the general stack at that location? What are the transmission constraints or availabilities under various scenarios? Who are the likely customers and what are their product preferences? Besides outright economics what are other barriers to entry into that area? It's a long list but it comes down to evaluating a plant on an option basis and the investment optionality it provides to your total portfolio.
Closing this target for this year pending federal regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.
In closing I'm proud to report that Entergy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for 2011 and 2012.
This marks the 10th consecutive year Entergy has received this prestigious recognition for its leadership in sustainability.
This year key categories where Entergy ranked among the very best were occupational health and safety corporate governance price and risk management floorboard measurements and of course climate strategy.
Our approach to climate change was also recognized in September by Entergy's inclusion in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index for the seventh time in the last 8 years.
Despite the challenges we're facing today we continue to set new financial and operational records along with continued leadership in sustainability.
For example Unit 1 of the Arkansas Nuclear One plant just completed 530 days of continuous operation setting a new record run for that site.
And a $207 million securitization financing closed in September for recovery of costs in the canceled Little Gypsy project was at approximately 2% coupon rate.
That was one of the lowest fixed-rate coupons ever achieved by Entergy or any of its subsidiaries.
Also financially our revised 2011 earnings outlook is consistent with another record year in operational earnings per share.
I believe that's something like 12 of the last 13 years that we've set a new record.
And now I'll turn the call over to Leo to review more of the specifics.
Leo? Thank you Wayne and good morning everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover third quarter results and cash flow performance followed by a few comments on capital deployment and our updated 2011 earnings guidance.
As Wayne noted we'll keep our comments brief and focus on the quarterly results and a few recent events.
We'll see most of you next week at EEI where we'll discuss longer-term strategic issues.
Starting with our financial results.
On Slide 2 third quarter 2011 earnings were higher at the Utility compared to a year ago while results were lower at EWC and Parent &amp; Other.
Third quarter earnings included accretion from share repurchases.
The lower share count is due to the effective repurchases completed in both 2011 and 2010.
Operational earnings were up significantly compared to third quarter 2010.
This increase is due largely to a tax settlement agreement with the IRS.
The settlement covered several issues the most significant related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of the utility power purchase agreement.
Slide 3 summarizes the effects of the settlement.
The net effect to the IRS tax settlement was $382 million reduction of income tax expense.
Entergy Louisiana will share a portion of the benefits with customers consistent with the intent of the original tax benefit sharing agreement.
In a settlement approved last month by the Louisiana Public Service Commission Entergy Louisiana will make annual payments of approximately $20.2 million to customers over the next 15 years.
Accordingly Entergy Louisiana recorded a $199 million regulatory charge net of tax and a corresponding regulatory liability to reflect this obligation.
The factors driving quarter on quarter results for each of the segments are summarized on Slide 4.
At the Utility the tax settlement and corresponding regulatory charge for the sharing arrangement were the primary drivers for quarter-over-quarter earnings growth.
Excluding these items Utility net revenue was slightly lower than a year ago.
Retail sales increased 2.4% compared to the third quarter last year or 2.6% on a weather-adjusted basis.
However net revenue is down in spite of benefits from weather-adjusted sales growth and regulatory actions.
Lower unbilled revenues provided the offset due to milder weather in the unbilled sales period at the end of the quarter.
Unbilled sales -- or the Utility sales statistics provided in Table 4 of the release reflect billed sales while revenue also includes the effect of unbilled sales.
Weather was again a significant factor for the quarter it was essentially flat to last year on an earnings per share basis.
This year was the warmest August on record and our system saw several new records.
System load for the month of August was highest in Entergy's history breaking the previous record set in August of 2000.
Three of the operating companies set new all-time peaks.
Most of the retail sales growth came in the industrial sector.
Entergy Louisiana Entergy Texas and Entergy Mississippi had the strongest industrial sales growth for the quarter.
The industrial sales trend was similar to what we've seen in previous quarters where expansion's continuing to drive the increase in industrial sales partially offset by weakening in paper pipeline and wood products segments.
Year-to-date total retail sales growth for the Utility is 2.4% on a weather-adjusted basis higher than the assumptions used on our full-year guidance due to stronger industrial results.
Regulatory actions also contributed to net revenue in the current quarter.
Results reflected 2010 Entergy Texas base rate adjustment as well as the Entergy Louisiana regulatory action associated with the Acadia acquisition earlier this year.
These items were partially offset by the October 2010 rate decrease at Entergy New Orleans.
Also contributing to the Utility earnings increase was lower nonfuel operation and maintenance expense.
Decreased O&amp;M is due in part to lower compensation and benefits expenses the absence of amortization of rate case expenses for Entergy Texas in this quarter last year and the deferral of previously expensed outage cost pursuant to the Entergy New Orleans regulatory agreement.
Moving on to Entergy Wholesale Commodities this year's third quarter results declined versus 2010 due primarily to lower net revenue and a higher effective income tax rate.
Net revenue for EWC's nuclear portfolio declined as a result of lower energy and capacity pricing.
For the EWC nuclear fleet the average realized price for the third quarter of this year was approximately $56 per megawatt hour compared to $61 a year ago.
Lower pricing was partially offset by higher nuclear volume.
Operationally EWC's nuclear fleet had an excellent quarter producing a 98% capacity factor compared to 91% last year.
The third quarter of 2010 included a portion of the scheduled outage at Fitzpatrick while there were no re-fuelings in the third quarter of this year.
There were also fewer unplanned outage days 14 days in the current quarter compared to 26 days for the same period a year ago.
A higher effective income tax rate also contributed to EWC's lower results.
The higher rate was driven by the absence of a reversal of a tax reserve and the net effect of consolidated tax adjustments both we recorded in the third quarter of last year.
You may recall that consolidated tax adjustments affecting individual lines of business but net to 0 at the Entergy level.
Partially offsetting these factors was lower nonfuel operation and maintenance expense partly due to lower compensation and benefits expenses.
Finally third quarter Parent &amp; Other results were lower than a year ago due primarily to higher income tax expense at Parent &amp; Other activities.
The income tax expense increase was due primarily to the absence of a reversal of the tax reserve in the third quarter of last year which resulted from a favorable tax court decision.
The absence of consolidated tax adjustments recorded last year also contributed to the income tax expense increase at Parent &amp; Other.
Moving to Slide 5 we review operating cash flow performance for the quarter.
While 2011 OCF was lower than last year the decrease was due to the absence of roughly $700 million in receipt of 2010 stored financing proceeds from Louisiana.
Absent that item OCF increased largely due to higher deferred fuel collections.
Intercompany tax payments did contribute to the line of business variances but were offsetting between Utility EWC and Parent &amp; Other.
Now turning to Slide 6 we provide some additional details in our recent agreement to acquire the Rhode Island State Energy Center or RISEC the 583-megawatt combined cycle plant including a planned upgrade to be completed prior to our purchase.
The RISEC acquisition aligns with our market base point of view.
This modern and efficient generation asset is well-positioned to benefit from expected market recovery and it complements the existing business by allowing more contracting flexibility for our portfolio of assets in the Northeast.
The agreed upon purchase price is approximately $346 million subject to closing adjustments.
The acquisition will be financed similar to other nonutility investments and we'll utilize available corporate resources.
Assuming closing by year-end we expect the asset to produce earnings per share in the range of $0.07 in 2012 based on forward natural gas and energy prices at the end of September 2011.
Just one point on our long-term financial outlook Entergy has an outlook to deploy up to $4 billion to $5 billion through dividends and share repurchases from 2010 through 2014 absent other attractive investment opportunities.
We continue to affirm that outlook.
Now turning to our share repurchase update summarized on Slide 7.
During the quarter we completed $75 million of share repurchases buying 1.1 million shares at an average price of $66 per share.
All of the repurchases were made through the existing $500 million board authorized program.
Year-to-date we have completed $150 million of share repurchases.
Recall that no buybacks were assumed in 2011 guidance.
Consistent with past practice we will continue to evaluate share repurchases against other capital deployment opportunities considering current business conditions and investment needs as well as liquidity and financial flexibility.
Slide 8 details our updated 2011 earnings guidance.
The net effect to the IRS and LPSC settlements discussed earlier is significant enough by itself to move 2011 results outside our original guidance range.
Therefore we revised our 2011 as reported and operational earnings guidance the range of $7.15 to $7.65 per share with a midpoint of $7.40.
The updated range takes into account year-to-date income tax expense adjustments above the level assumed on the original guidance including the IRS settlement agreement net of the amount to be shared with the Entergy Louisiana customers.
In closing as Wayne said we plan to review our longer-term outlook at the upcoming EEI Conference next week similar to our past practice of the last 2 years.
At that time we also plan to initiate 2012 guidance and review the details on key drivers for 2012 provide a preliminary roll forward of our 3-year capital plan for 2012 through 2014 summarize our long-term financial outlook and discuss longer-term strategies and opportunities.
And now the Entergy senior team is available for your questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Trying to -- just when we go over the $1.02 of IRS benefit you guys are showing sort of an $0.80 increase.
Is that because you guys had anticipated some sort of benefit it just was a much lower amount? That's correct Paul.
We had -- in our planning for the year-end guidance we typically go through a tax perspective what we believe may or may not show up during the course of the year to help set not only the midpoint range but the midpoint but the guidance range.
And so we had anticipated some level of tax benefit showing up during the year and the settlement is bigger than that.
But we had about $40 million or so of tax benefits already baked into our guidance.
So this is -- the $0.80 is the increment of whatever was already there.
Okay.
And I know you guys are going to be giving guidance and everything at EEI and can't wait for that but just any sense as to how we should think about taxes the potential tax situation or effective tax rate that we should be thinking about for 2012? Well we'll bring that up when we get into the guidance at 2012.
It's kind of difficult to talk about it in an isolation without talking about earnings in general.
Okay.
Just the other thing I just wanted to touch base with is the growth of customers versus sales.
It does look like customers are using less outside the industrial area and I was wondering if you guys thought that was sort of a temporary thing or whether or not you thought that that might rebound next year or if you're seeing something you think might be more permanent sort of the kind of stuff that we've seen on the gas side maybe? Gary? Yes this is Gary Taylor.
Yes I think what we have seen and probably in a broader context is pretty similar to what you've seen along the region is -- when you think about residential they tend to really affect the price elasticity quite a bit.
Their bills were up about 10% to 15% with high heat.
I think we've seen an impact that playing through.
I mean so that's one factor.
Energy efficiency is playing through as well in all classes and we factored that into our plan.
And we're kind of seeing the same with commercial as well where commercial has really followed what you've seen in the economy.
So as the economy recovers we'd expect commercial to come back.
Industrial has actually been very very strong as Leo said actually stronger than we would have expected.
And our overall sales are a little bit above our existing plan.
And if you think about how Entergy is positioned I saw some EEI data that basically says for the Southeast sales weather-adjusted were up about 1.5% this year and we've up for about 2.5% overall.
But what we should see is as price mediate a little bit residential should come back up some and commercial is going to pretty much follow what we think the economy is going to do.
We'll talk more at EEI what we expect as far as sales next year.
Next we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> I guess 2 questions.
First on the accretion from the transaction.
When -- I mean obviously I think you generally financed this with cash on hand or debt.
That in theory it also replaces other uses of cash like potentially more buybacks.
So when you're giving the accretion estimates are you doing it -- how are you kind of thinking about the financing? Is it is essentially are these accretive versus the other ways you would have used this money? Well that's accretion on a whole excluding financing.
And you're right.
It's fungible in terms of whether it comes out of the incremental borrowings or utilizes dollars that we otherwise would have used for the buyback.
So it's not net of that in terms of what we reported.
Research Division</strong> So it's not net of any financing cost or just net of like debt like use of the bank lines or something? Yes it's not net of any real financing cost.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And is this accretion -- I'm sorry.
Is this accretion including the benefit to the company on the local nuclear plants in terms of maybe selling the power differently or not? No.
It's not.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So it's not -- so it's without financing cost but also without changing the way you're selling the nuke.
Correct.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
One other question.
When you look at year-to-date the benefits if you do -- go to your little table the benefits of like sales and rate actions year-to-date I think it's $0.15 a share versus last year from Page 9.
And when you gave guidance I think that you had expected that to be $0.45.
But it seems like sales have been pretty good and I'm not aware of any surprises on rate actions so I'm curious why that's trailing.
Or is it just -- is there a big fourth quarter catch-up? Well one aspect of it is the delay in Waterford 3 that was supposed to be in rates this year and now will be next year.
A delay in closing of Acadia by a month and that was factored in as well.
Research Division</strong> Are you booking AFC on those things so it's not really earnings impactful or it is? It's not exactly as good as putting them in rates.
Acadia there was not because it was an acquisition.
But there would be fewer dollars because of the spend being delayed in Waterford.
The ASLB seal [ph]  Will just be on the portion that's been expended as opposed to all of it being in rates earlier this year.
[Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
This is Neil Mehta here for Michael Lapides.
Lots of O&amp;M improvement in the quarter.
Can you walk through again what the key levers were and if there were any unusual items embedded in that O&amp;M? The key drivers for the O&amp;M decrease is really lower compensation and benefits expenses was been the biggest driver between this year and last year.
Got it.
And then separate question.
Your debt refinancing plans at the holding company especially related to the credit facility next year can you provide any color related to that? You should see us probably start to take action on this credit facility here in a pretty short order.
We've got till August of 2012 before that is -- before that expires.
So certainly around the first part of the year we'll get that taken care of.
Next we'll go to Ashar Khan [ph] with Visium Asset Management [ph].
Just going back to the -- so can we assume that as you had mentioned in your assumptions that weather was like $0.62 positive last year and you expected that to -- normal would've been a $0.62 variance negative that as weather has been pretty much flat year-over-year we have kept majority of that $0.62 this year versus losing any.
Would that be a fair comment? It's a -- you're right weather has been flat year-on-year.
When we move guidance Ashar we didn't take into effect anything other than the incremental tax position.
So we didn't incorporate anything into the move for guidance.
For weather we didn't include anything in it as it relates to reduced pricing in the Northeast.
We didn't include anything in there as it relates to the Waterford 3 delay that we were just talking about.
So you're correct that we've seen about $0.57 of weather I think this year which is pretty close to what we saw last year.
I think you asked about that actually on last quarter's call and I think I told you not to count third quarter weather this year just like last year.
And I don't know what you knew about the weather that you would know it would come out exactly the same on an earnings per share basis.
But I think we had the $0.29 last year and this year both so.
Okay.
And then just going back to Steve's question.
As you said you had factored in like $0.45 and normally it seems like probably $0.20 would show up this year.
Can we then assume that this $0.25 that didn't show up this year is really as you're saying going into next year rather than this year? Is that a fair thing to say? In terms of the rate actions and load growth? Right.
You had mentioned $0.45 for sales growth and rate actions so as you're saying year-to-date we might end up around $0.20 versus the $0.45.
So can we take the remaining $0.25 as you mentioned some of the factors got delayed can we assume that these are then reflected next year? Well next year you will see the full year impact of Acadia and when the assets that didn't get in rates this year are getting rates next year you'll see that step up from there yes.
That will be included in what we come out with in guidance for 2012.
Yes.
And the other thing the Waterford 3 steam generator project's not scheduled to be completed to the end of 2012 so you wouldn't see the impact of it until basically 2013.
Understood.
But you know the amount that we lost like $0.20 this year or so they've been really delayed to '12 right? That's what's happened.
It's not that they've gone to '13.
Or has some moved to '13 as well? The Waterford 3 will be toward the end of the year next year.
So you won't get a full year of it.
You won't get much in next year as we would have had this year.
[Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to Reza Hatefi with Decade Capital.
On the weather question.
So I guess since the great weather you've had this year is not included in your revised earnings guidance I guess how should we think about that as you finish the year? Is it just once you print your fourth quarter numbers does it all of a sudden show up? Or I'm kind of just confused on how to think about that.
There will be a variety of things I guess that will kind of get into the end of year number again though we haven't made adjustments for weather or lower capacity and energy pricing in the Northeast the Waterford 3 delay et cetera.
So I guess one way to think about it is that the low end of the range is probably not something that we'll be would be looking at by the end of the year.
And I'm sorry if you answered this earlier but O&amp;M this year I forget what the earnings impact was when you originally guided in last EEI but how does that track versus your original guidance? And would you consider maybe spending some O&amp;M here to sort of offset the good weather you've had bringing it forward I guess? Well certainly when you've had the kind of weather we've had you'll have a situation where the plants are running more the system is stressed more and so there'll be O&amp;M associated with that in both the generation and TD basis.
So some of that might just be incremental some of it certainly would be having to do maintenance on facilities sooner than we otherwise would have thought we had to because we're running the system harder because of the weather.
And then actually it's 2 years in a row.
So that's certainly a possibility that you see O&amp;M pick up to match the kind of operational characteristics of the system in this kind of weather.
And that will conclude our question-and-answer session today.
At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Paula Waters.
Thank you Caroline.
And thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release and website for safe harbor and Regulation G compliance statements.
Our call was recorded and can be accessed for the next 7 days by dialing (719) 457-0820 replay code 4650540.
This concludes our call.
Thank you.
Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time for introductions and opening comments I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Wayne Leonard; and then Leo Denault our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] As part of today's conference call Entergy corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Wayne.
Okay thanks Paula.
Good morning everyone.
At our Analyst Conference last April and since then we have discussed the plans and strategies to positively resolve overhang issues that are negatively influencing your view of our future prospects.
At EEI in November I made a number of personal predictions on how I felt the future playing out.
One was that we would find the right partner and financial structure to allow a divestiture of our transmission business in a way that is in all stakeholders' best interest.
Another was that Vermont Yankee will not be shut down.
While neither of those are closed issues as of today we are pleased with our progress.
As for other viewpoints I expressed I standby those as well.
And while we don't have specific outcomes to report today we have been equally active in making them a reality.
Starting in Vermont.
Consistent with our in-depth analysis on January 19 the U.S.
District Court for the District of Vermont declared unconstitutional the state of Vermont's attempts to force the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant to close on March 21 of this year.
The court ruled that Vermont Act 160 and a provision in Vermont Act 74 were preempted by the Federal Atomic Energy Act because they were enacted with radiological safety concerns in mind.
Act 160 passed by the Vermont Legislature in 2006 required legislative approval for continued operation after March 21 2012 before the Vermont Public Service Board to decide whether to grant a Certificate of Public Good or CPG to Vermont Yankee.
The provision struck down and Act 74 had required legislative approval for storage and suspend nuclear field from operations after March 21 2012.
The court found that "There is overwhelming evidence in a legislative record that Act 160 was grounded in radiological safety concerns and the strong commitment desire to empower the legislature to act on those concerns and deciding the question of Vermont Yankee's continued operation." Similarly the court concluded that "Radiological safety concerns were the primary motivating force for enacting Act 74 in particular the requirement for a permanent legislative approval for Penfield storage after March 21 2012." Furthermore the court founded the issuance of the CPG for continued operations and not be conditioned on the below wholesale market power purchase agreement with Vermont or the Vermont Utilities or Vermont Yankee selling power to the Vermont Utilities at rates below those available to wholesale customers in other states.
Over the last few years there has been a nearly constant Entergy bashing in Vermont.
And among other things our company's integrity and our trustworthiness.
We had chosen to not engage those attacks in the media.
However Judge Murtha's meticulous 102-page order rejects the state's assertion "Entergy comes to the court with unclean hands." By stating "Dependents have offered no evidence Entergy acted inequitably or in bad faith.
And the court holds this argument unpersuasive." The court's decision is good news good news for our 600 employees at Vermont Yankee the environment and the community and also supports the proposition that the rule of law applies to everyone.
The American justice system's blind in this application to see some facts beyond the surface in getting to the truth.
Since the ruling was issued a little over a week ago the #1 question being asked is "What are the next steps?" We do not know what Vermont's next step will be.
If they plan to appeal Judge Murtha's decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals they are required to file a notice with the Court by February 21.
As for us we are considering our options for recovering from the state of Vermont the costs and attorney's fees incurred in the case thus far.
In addition today we filed a motion with the Vermont Public Service Board asking the Board to take action in existing CPG docket without further proceedings to grant a new CPG or amend the existing one to permit operation of VY through March 21 2032.
As a reminder in March 2008 we filed a request with the Board to issue a CPG for operation past March 2012.
Hearings were held in the second quarter of 2009 followed with the filing of proposals for decisions and initial brief for the parties in July 2009.
With the judge finding that no nuclear safety or power contract issues can be the basis for denial we believe there is nothing standing in the way of initialing the CPG.
We believe the evidence is complete and supports the decision to allow it's continued operation.
The law does allow the plant to continue to operate past March of -- March 21 if the decision on a new CPG has not been made.
Now there may be arguments that the issuance of the CPG is premature and so the state decides whether to appeal the decision and if so the appeals process is exhausted.
But nonetheless the record indicates it's complete now.
In other license renewal news the Pilgrim Nuclear Station came one step closer to obtaining the 20-year extension of its operating license.
On January 11 the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board or ASLB dismissed the last pending late-filed contention and formally terminated proceedings before them with the words "Denied and Terminated" in capital letters.
5 appeals of ASLB decisions including the most recent one have been filed with the commission.
As we've stated in our August 23 motion NRC regulations allows for the staff to issue Pilgrim's license renewal with appeals pending.
That motion remains pending with the NRC.
However issuance of Pilgrim's extended operating license might not occur until all appeals are resolved.
As we have stated repeatedly in the past the NRC's timely renewal doctrine allows for continued operations past June 8 if our application remains unresolved at that time.
In the state of New York preparations have began for hearings before the ASLB on Indian Point license renewal application.
There are currently 14 consolidated issues admitted into preceding that will be the subject of the hearings which are expected to begin in the third quarter.
On a parallel path hearings continued from October 2011 to January of this year before Administrative Law Judges of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation or DEC were completed for the designated first set of issues.
Issues covered in its first phase were: The efficacy of our Wedgewire screen proposal was the DEC properly denied the water quality certification application based upon the impact if any of the leakage of radiological material into the groundwater beneath Indian Point and whether Indian Point impairs the best uses of the Hudson River.
Remaining issues include endangered species consideration the management appeals water discharges and whether the cooling towers are the best technology available on this site.
The trial and the remaining issues is expected to resume later this year but an end date is not clear at this time.
The start of these hearings is certainly a milestone in both the NRC and state processes.
But I would note that Pilgrim entered this hearing stage on its NRC application in April 2008 nearly 4 years ago.
And Pilgrim had 2 admitted contentions and the NRC license renewal proceedings versus the 14 consolidated contentions with what the ASLB for Indian Point today.
The decision on Indian Point's continued operation ultimately rests with the NRC.
The water quality proceedings before the New York DEC are focused primarily on the evaluation of operations with cooling towers versus operations with our proposed waste water screen alternative or simply maintaining the status quo.
And nothing has changed my view that these proceedings included in the appeals could take many years to complete.
While we do recognize it certainly has valued all stakeholders during the potentially extended time frame it takes for the NRC to render a final decision Indian Point can continue to operate under the NRC's timely renewal doctrine.
Actually that is pretty close pretty certain itself.
In other words the weight of the policy contentions of [ph] the NRC must wade through does not lead to an expeditious shutdown but more likely that this process could extend deeply into the license extension period we are asking for.
It could be a horse race on which process takes longer to litigate the federal or the state.
In other EWC matters Entergy closed on its acquisition of the 583-megawatt Rhode Island State Energy Center Power plant in late December.
The rising plant is an efficient plant to diversify EWC's position across the dispatch curve and provides us with additional dispatch flexibility to extract value for market volatility enhances our ability to manage risk and value across our New England portfolio something we've seen in recent weeks.
EWC will continue to focus on managing open portfolio commodity risks and actively seeking out some more hedging products volumes and timing going forward.
At year end 2011 EWC had sold 88% of nuclear generation for this year and 81% for next year at prices that are now $7 to $15 per megawatt-hour above the current markets.
At Utility.
On December 5 we announced that the Board of Directors of Entergy and ITC Holdings approved an agreement by which Entergy will divest and then merge its transmission business into a subsidiary of ITC's reverse lower-stress structure.
We will see various approvals for the transaction including from each of Entergy's retail regulatory jurisdictions.
We believe the transaction provides tangible benefits to customers and all other stakeholders.
Moreover this outcome is consistent with congressional intent enforce policy and direction and also addresses transmission issues raised by other entities that rely on the operating public transmission system.
Immediately following the announcement we'll begin working jointly with ITC to obtain an understanding of our regulators' perspective on the proposed transaction in advance of initiating any regulatory filing.
We fully intend those filings will address any issues of concern.
We will make the change for controlled filings once this pending process is complete.
The targeted close of the transaction remains in 2013.
Once the pre-requisite to the closing calls for the Entergy systems to have all the necessary approvals from the state and local regulatory jurisdictions to join a reasonable transmission organization.
The progress continues on that front.
The change of control filings to join the Midwest Independent System Operator or MISO made in all jurisdictions except Texas.
Texas operates under a requirement to issue an order within 180 days of the filing.
And as a result we want to add other jurisdictions to make further progress on our request to join MISO before Texas is required to issue a decision.
Procedural schedules on the MISO change of control proceeding for the Louisiana Public Service Commission and the Arkansas Public Service Commission had hearings occurring in May and in early June followed by a potential decision shortly thereafter.
Decisions in the other jurisdictions are expected by the third quarter of 2012.
It is our belief that change with control filings to join MISO should be considered separately from the ITC transaction.
In other Utility regulatory developments Entergy Texas filed a rate case in late November requesting a 2 -- a $112 million base rate increase and a 10.6% ROE.
Rate case will also set base lines for transmission and distribution as well as purchase power capacity costs that could be used in future rider recovery mechanisms.
Transmission and distribution riders have already been authorized and the Public Utility Commission of Texas opened the rulemaking project last year to consider a purchase power capacity line to mechanisms as well.
In Entergy Texas rate case the parties have agreed to schedule to contemplate the final decision by July 30 with ultimate rates relating back to June 30.
In Louisiana in mid-November the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved one-year extensions of the formula rate plans for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.
As part of the approval for the extensions both Louisiana utilities will be required to file base rate cases by January of 2013.
Also for Entergy Louisiana the FRP extension includes a provision related to the Waterford 3 Steam Generator replacement project initiating recovery without any regulatory lag through the May FRP filing assuming an in-service state at the beginning of 2013 subject to refund improvements review.
And the over-earnings will be applied to produce the incremental revenue requirement.
These rates are expected to stay in place until completion of Entergy Louisiana's base rate case to be filed in January of 2013.
In Mississippi developments 2 more independent firms hired by the Mississippi Public Service Commission have completed their review of Entergy's Mississippi's fuel and energy procurement practices and procedures.
Moreover these latest audits continue to confirm that there have been no improper charges by the company to its customers.
The fuel audits are the 6th and 7th MPSC-commissioned independent audit since 2008 all have reached the same conclusion.
Inquires into Entergy's Mississippi's steel purchase practice began after rising gas prices led to a 28% increase in the typical Entergy Mississippi residential bill.
Earlier this month the Mississippi Public Service Commission voted unanimously to certify the audits and file them with the state legislature.
In 2012 utility has a full agenda once again addressing regulatory and capital projects initiatives.
In addition to the annual formula rate plan filings in Louisiana Mississippi and New Orleans Utility will complete the rate case in Texas and prepare for rate case filings for Louisiana as well as potentially other retail jurisdictions as they plan for the proposed integration into MISO.
Utility will also seek approval of the change in control products to join MISO by the third quarter while separately pursuing approvals for the spin-merge of the transition business.
Further Utility will focus on cost-efficient integration planning to enable a seamless transition to MISO and for the spin-merge of the transmission business.
In addition Entergy Arkansas will continue to prepare for its exit of the industry system agreement now less than 2 years away.
At nuclear 2 major capital projects will be completed in 2012.
First in the spring the approximate 178-megawatt upgrade at Grand Gulf is scheduled to be completed during the refueling outage.
Once the upgrade is installed the reactor in Grand Gulf will have the largest capacity of any single nuclear generating of its type in its station.
Then the Waterford 3 stall refueling outages steam generator vessel head replacement project is scheduled to be installed.
The Utility's possible generation fleet the process to obtain regulatory approval in Louisiana to issue the full notice to proceed our construction of Ninemile unit 6 a 550-megawatt combined cycle power plant is nearing completion.
New Orleans regulators are expected to get final approval from Entergy New Orleans' 20% participation at the Ninemile 6 project at February 2 to the city council meeting at EWC.
Goals for 2012 are consistent with prior year's.
Beyond our overarching objective of safe and secure operations of a nuclear fleet we expect to close out Pilgrim's license renewal proceedings and of course defend against any attempt to nullify or overturn any part of the Federal Court's recent decision of January 19 2012.
While resolution in Indian Point will not occur this year in a regulatory setting at least EWC will continue to establish the fact-based records compliance with all laws and regulations and the NRC license renewal proceeding and in the water quality proceeding before the New York DEC.
Should an opportunity for achieving certainty at Indian Point arise that is fair to all stakeholders and can be assured that we will pursue that with a number of creative ideas and have an open mind to the needs and ideas of others.
EWC will also continue to apply its dynamic point of view in the midst of uncertain and rapidly evolving commodity markets sway fundamental views of natural -- use of natural gas and power prices against forward-hedging opportunities that exist in the market.
Finally we will communicate updates to our long-term financial objectives at a future date.
Among other factors timing will depend upon when there is better clarity around long-term commodity price pass as the transmission spin-merge transaction progresses.
2011 was once again a strong year financially and operationally.
At the Utility we maintain reliability of the bulk electric systems through 2011's highest events tornadoes and record flooding.
And in the summer we set a new record for non-coincident peak hour loads with the system in 3 of our 4 jurisdictions.
At the same time we improved our J.D.
Power Associate's customer satisfaction scores with 2 jurisdictions noted among the most improved utilities.
The EWC continues to set operational records the longest continuous runs were completed at Pilgrim at 642 days.
There's the one seriously troubled Cooper unit in Nebraska at 483 days.
And Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim were evaluated once again in the excellence category as compared to peers.
A distinction held by a total of 5 plants in the Entergy's nuclear fleet.
Financially operational earnings per share of $7.62 exceeded last year's record of $7.10 marking the 11th  record in the last 12 years.
And operating cash flow remains strong at $3.1 billion.
This does not equate to similar record performance in the 2011 shareholder return.
Earnings have grown in the compound average annual rate of 10% in the last 13 years since the end in 1998.
Although the 2011 earnings reporting season had just begun the 12-year annual average earnings growth rate for the members of the Philadelphia Utility Index was about 4% at the end of 2010.
So earnings have grown about 2.5x the industry average even at a depressed commodity market.
During its 13-year period since the end of 1998 Entergy's shareholder return has averaged 10.6% per year compared to the 6.8% annual return for the Philadelphia Utility Index or about 150% of the industry average ranking in the top quartile of the index members.
But Entergy's 2011 total shareholder return was 8.3% significantly below the 19.3% return by the Philadelphia Utility Index ranking us in the bottom quartile.
We take no comfort in what we have accomplished in the past to the difficulty resolved in the overhanging issues expeditiously without giving it substantial long-term value.
Recent events such as the ITC transaction announcement and the district court's decision on Vermont Yankee illustrate our commitment and our resolve to do well and do right by our stakeholders.
Specifically we will not be satisfied with anything less than returning to the top quartile in total shareholder return on both an annual and a cumulative basis.
Before closing I want to take this opportunity to thank 2 key members of our leadership team whose retirements were announced this morning.
Bob Sloan the Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Gary Taylor Group President of Utility Operations.
Both have achieved the end-or-all aiming core to retire having successfully achieved our professional goals while still having the opportunity to fully enjoy the next phase of our lives.
In Bob's case the recent successful outcome of our federal litigation regarding Vermont Yankee [indiscernible] distinguished career with Entergy and General Electric before that.
During his time with Entergy Bob reshaped the legal department enhancing the quality and efficiency of legal services to meet the company's changing needs developing more robust practice areas and adding key personnel including in environmental labor nuclear and the federal regulatory area.
Assuming responsibility for the legal organization of Marcus Brown.
Marcus is on the call with us today.
Marcus has been on point for high-profile litigations including leading the Entergy legal team in the Vermont Yankee case and legal efforts in Entergy's New Orleans successful emergence from bankruptcy with a full compensation reorganizational plan.
Gary's influence in the company's success reaches throughout the company in both the nuclear and in Utility operations.
During his 7 years in nuclear organizations including the last 4 as CEO of Entergy Nuclear Gary elevated safety and operational excellence to best-in-class.
He's instrumental in our acquisition of the Palisades Nuclear Power plant and brought together the Utility and non-utility into one organization for the first time.
He brought the same safety and operational excellence focus along with the commitment to our customers and delivering shareholder return the Utility business over the last 5 years.
Gary is fully committed through his retirement on May 31 with a seamless transition to his successor who will be named at a later date.
So you will get every opportunity to extend your well wishes at the upcoming events or conferences to Gary and I hope you do.
Now I will turn the call over to Leo.
Leo? Thank you Wayne and good morning everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial results our cash flow performance for the quarter and the full year and a review of our 2012 earnings guidance including some comments on quarterly timing of results.
In reviewing 2011 results a few things stand out.
We achieved record operational earnings per share for the seventh year in a row.
And 11 out of the last 12 Utility EPS grew more than 40%.
EWC's nuclear fleet achieved a 93% capacity factor including 2 scheduled refueling outages below the 30-day targets.
We successfully closed on 2 plant acquisitions the 580-megawatt Acadia plant for the Utility and the 583-megawatt Rhode Island State Energy Center which will expand EWC's product options in New England.
Utility announced an agreement to spin-off and then merge its transmission business into ITC and we will return nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Before I talk about the full year I'll quickly review the financial results for the quarter.
Slide 2 summarizes fourth quarter 2011 as reported in operational earnings results which were lower at Parent &amp; Other compared to a year ago while results were higher at Utility and EWC.
On Slide 3 the factors that drove the quarter-on-quarter results are outlined in more detail.
Parent &amp; Other operational results declined in the fourth quarter due primarily to higher income tax expense.
Parent &amp; Other as reported results for the quarter included a special item the special expenses incurred in connection with the proposed spin-off and merger of Entergy's transmission business which we announced in December.
Now turning to the Utility earnings in fourth quarter.
2011 were higher than last year.
The major driver was again lower income tax expense.
After excluding the effect of prior year regulatory item that was offset in other income net revenue was not a significant driver for the quarter.
Retail sales declined 1.8% however on a weather-adjusted basis increased by 0.6%.
Weather was negative for the quarter versus the positive weather we experienced in the fourth quarter last year.
The weather-adjusted sales growth was driven by higher industrial sales which increased 2.5% quarter-over-quarter as the positive benefits of facility expansions continue.
Sales and other retail segments declined compared to fourth quarter a year ago.
At EWC operational results were higher than the fourth quarter last year.
The increase was due to a lower effective income tax rate and reduction in the decommissioning liability which also reduced decommissioning expense.
Partial offsets include the absence of the gain on the sale of our interest in the Harrison County plant which we sold on December 31 2010 and lower net revenue.
EWC's net revenue declined largely as a result of lower energy and capacity pricing for its nuclear fleet.
EWC's nuclear generation was 95% hedged for the quarter and the average price for the sold portion of the portfolio was around $52 per megawatt hour.
The average energy price for the -- market energy price for the quarter was $35.
The effect of these lower prices was partially offset by higher nuclear volume.
Billed sales for the nuclear fleet were up 7.5% with fewer planned and unplanned outage days.
The fleet capacity factor was 93% for the quarter compared to 86% in the prior year.
On Slide 4 we've summarized EWC's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and full year.
While we have occasionally presented EWC's adjusted EBITDA in the past we will now provide this view as part of our quarterly discussions on EWC's results.
For the quarter and full year EWC's adjusted EBITDA was lower than the same periods a year ago.
The decrease is largely attributable to the absence of the gain on the sale of Harrison County plant and lower net revenue as I just discussed.
Slide 5 provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow in the current quarter was just under $1 billion about $240 million higher than the same quarter last year.
This change was due to lower pension funding and lower working capital requirements.
Moving to full year results Slide 6 compares 2011 as reported on operational earnings to 2010.
Higher operational earnings at the Utility were partially offset by lower results at EWC and Parent &amp; Other.
On an operational basis 2011 earnings per share ended the year at $7.62 up 7.3% over 2010.
The main drivers for this increase were an income tax settlement with the IRS recorded in the third quarter of the current year which reduced income tax expense $382 million less $199 million regulatory charge to reflect a regulatory agreement to share a portion of the tax benefits with customers.
Higher Utility net revenue after excluding the effect of the regulatory charge just mentioned accretion associated with Entergy's share repurchase program and a reduction in the decommissioning liability at EWC which reduced decommissioning expense.
Items providing a partial offset include lower net revenue at EWC and the absence of the gain on the sale at EWC noted earlier.
Slide 7 provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the full year.
For the year 2011 operating cash flow was $3.1 billion down from a record $3.9 billion in 2010.
The decrease is due primarily to the absence of the receipt of roughly $700 million of proceeds associated with storm-related debt issuances for 2008 hurricanes in Louisiana and lower EWC net revenue.
Slide 8 details our 2012 operational earnings guidance which we're affirming today at $5.40 $6.20 per share.
Previously issued as recorded earnings guidance of $5.40 to $6.20 per share for 2012 does not reflect any potential future expenses for the special item in connection with the proposed spin-merge of Entergy's transmission business.
As reported earnings guidance will be updated to reflect the special item as the actual costs are incurred throughout 2012.
The details of our earnings guidance shown on Slide 8 should be familiar to you as most of the drivers have not changed since we initiated guidance last November.
In keeping with past practice we have however adjusted a few line items to reflect final 2011 results including weather the decommissioning liability adjustment noted at EWC and income tax by segment.
While we do not update all line items in our guidance table we do provide details on assumptions at the time guidance was issued and comparable information today.
While we are affirming our operational earnings guidance range we already know of some challenges that I'd like to highlight.
First I'd like to touch on commodity prices.
Since the end of the third quarter we've seen natural gas and power prices decline roughly 20% across the curve through 2016.
As you know there's been some rebound in the last week or so.
For EWC's plants in the Northeast market 2012 market energy prices now average in the range of $35 per megawatt hour compared with an average unsold energy price assumption of $46 reflected in guidance.
Conversely forward markets for the New York capacity have shown signs of initial recovery from their low point last summer.
Another headwind that we face for 2012 is pension expense.
When we issued guidance we assumed a pension discount rate of 5.6%.
The final pension discount rate is 5.1%.
This lower rate combined with other updated assumptions will result in higher pension expense.
We estimate the earnings impact will be in the range of $0.24 per share below the guidance midpoint assumption.
Some offsets include lower interest costs lower depreciation and the capacity prices that I mentioned earlier.
With that in mind earnings estimates currently point to the bottom of the range.
That said it is still early.
We need to focus on things we can control such as spending levels and operations.
We will continue to work towards offsetting these challenges and keep you updated on our progress.
One last point on 2012 as it relates to quarterly results.
While we do not provide quarterly guidance Slide 9 outlines some key events to keep in mind in considering the quarters.
2011 earnings were heavily weighted in the third quarter due to the IRS settlement and associated regulatory reserve.
2011 EPS includes the $0.52 of weather primarily in the second and third quarters.
Utility net revenue can be affected by seasonality as well as the timing of regulatory rate actions such as the Entergy Texas rate action which we are assuming effective around midyear.
We're also assuming Hinds and Hot Spring acquisitions and the Grand Gulf upgrade to be placed in service around mid-2012.
At EWC the fourth quarter of 2011 included an adjustment to the decommissioning liability which reduced decommissioning expense $0.12.
While there is ongoing impact to this adjustment it is not significant.
Quarter-over-quarter non-fuel O&amp;M variances are reflected by both the timing of spending and the occurrence or absence of specific events.
Finally tax items are lumpy by nature.
Significant tax benefits in 2011 realized in the second and third quarters.
In closing I'd like to recap some accomplishments from this past year that position us well for the future.
We completed the RISEC acquisition which adds a new flexible plant to the New England market.
EWC also added nuclear hedges last year particularly for 2013 delivery where the energy sold forward position more than doubled to 81%.
This provides additional certainty on future revenue streams not only increasing the volume hedged but also prudently utilizing firm product structures to address the challenging commodity market and unique portfolio positions such a pending license renewals.
Looking ahead to 2012 EWC will continue our focus in key areas of the merchant generation business including license renewal for our nuclear plants our analytical and market-facing capabilities and positioning EWC to capture the long-term potential upside from key rate expansion.
At the Utility in 2011 we continue to build on the Utility's progress get the operating companies the opportunity to earn their allowed return on equity and the growth story for the Utility based on productive investments and flexible regulatory mechanisms remains intact.
As we plan our strategies and initiatives for the future we continue to take the steps necessary to name financial flexibility as reflected in solid credit metrics and strong liquidity.
As an example the ITC spin-merge transaction will increase flexibility of the Utility's investment alternatives and protect credit quality of Entergy and its operating companies.
I can assure you the management team is focused every day on accomplishing the goals that Wayne laid out for you earlier this morning towards the overarching financial goal of creating and delivering sustainable long-term value to all of our stakeholders.
And now the Entergy team is available for your questions.
[Operator Instructions].
And we'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> My first question is on some of the tax items.
I'm -- just reading the footnotes to the variance table you talk about the consolidated adjustments which net to 0 and also the shift of the nuclear power marketing but within Utility you also highlighted favorable income tax adjustments and then at Parent unfavorable income tax reserve adjustments.
Any chance you could quantify those or give us a sense of whether they netted out? And what was sort of a net impact of tax adjustments in the quarter? Well the net impact wasn't that significant.
You've got the consolidated tax savings.
Those adjustments are all net to 0 just shifting between Utility EWC Parent &amp; Other.
And the impact of all the other adjustments was pretty close to 0 as well.
So the overall effective tax rate if you look at that is 36%.
Research Division</strong> So the net is just noise within the segments that you're referencing after? Correct.
Correct.
Research Division</strong> Okay and on year-to-date basis is there a similar number you could give us? Well on the year-to-date basis the big issue that we have is the IRS tax settlement which effectively turns a temporary difference to a permanent difference.
And that was the big third quarter adjustment that we have.
Other than that we make all of those consolidated tax adjustments in the fourth quarter so those are all embedded in the year as well.
But the big item for taxes for the year was the IRS settlement.
That's the $382 million that I mentioned.
But in the third quarter -- but then you also have the offset because of the regulatory sharing agreement of $199 million in the same quarter which impacted the Utility segment's revenue.
Research Division</strong> Thanks Leo.
And then if I may on another topic Wayne I think you mentioned the sort of thought that the Vermont PSB would reopen the existing proceeding they have on the Certificate of Public Good.
Is it possible that they could start a new proceeding altogether? And what are your thoughts on the sort of those 2 different routes? Well we've had a lot of discussion among ourselves about what we think what they may or may not do.
And if there's 4 of us in the discussions there's 4 different opinions on what they may or may not do.
So the -- I'm not going to speculate about that.
We expect that they will follow the law.
We expect that they will follow the record at some point in time in this case.
I expect that there will be pressure to let the appeal...
get the appeal exhaust before they make that decision but we're just going to have to wait and see first of all whether the state decides to appeal.
And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> First Bob and Gary best of luck just in case I don't get to see you.
And on the questions the -- Leo on the pension increase that you're projecting now for 2012 the additional $0.24 is there a way to break that out between the effect to the Utilities versus the effect to the other -- the unregulated businesses? Yes there is.
It's about -- in general our pension our liabilities are about 75% of the Utility and 25% is the EWC portion of that.
So in all of those things when you're looking whether it's a cash flow statement or whatever that's the general rule of thumb.
Research Division</strong> Okay and does it -- obviously that may mean that you under-earn a little more in 2012 so does this potentially change any thoughts on timing of rate cases? Well what -- the way pension -- net pension expense runs through the regulatory mechanisms such that it's a cost to service.
So what we'll see is anything that has a test year for example of 2012 will include the pension expense that we recorded in 2012.
Research Division</strong> Right.
So just get through without in the formula rates potentially? Their process...
Either the formula rates were in the 60% or so of the business where we have those or in rate cases when they -- whenever those are a test year.
Research Division</strong> Okay and then I guess my last question is just on the ITC transaction.
I know you're still in the -- I think as you called the vetting process but on the regulatory side do you have -- would it be fair to say to expect filings in the second quarter on the transaction with the states or too hard to pin down still? Steve it's Wayne.
The -- we wouldn't want to discount that or commit to it.
We have another round coming up a visit with regulators and it actually starts next week and have better insight into where we stand at that point in time so ask me that at our next conference.
We'll go next to Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Leo I thought I heard you earlier say that nuclear decommissioning impact on the fourth quarter would essentially not affect 2012.
What was -- what did you reflect in the fourth quarter and why doesn't it have an impact on '12 earnings? It's basically a reset of the liability based on a commitment we made to the state when we acquired the plant that we would review the cost of decommissioning at this time.
So it's a commitment we made to the state of Vermont that we would reestimate what that liability is and so we're actually just making a change in the liability going forward based on changing assumptions mostly around interest rates escalation rates et cetera.
And so that reset of the liability runs through the income statement in the period which you do it.
Going forward because the liability is lower there is an impact between now and the end of the plant's life.
But it's not a big number like this one it's as much smaller number.
So it's not really the kind of thing that you're going to notice one way or the other going forward.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And going back to the back to taxes if I look at the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 it looks like to be in the 26% range versus the 37% range this quarter.
What were the drivers behind the change in effective tax rate quarter-over-quarter? We had some -- I'll try not to use the buzzword for it but basically when we finished up the 2009 tax return in 2010 there are some adjustments made to what we actually filed versus what we would have estimated at that time and that those are made in the fourth quarter.
That happens every year.
It just happened to be a little bit more significant last year at the Utility.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay and last for me is can you update us at all on I guess you had filed several years ago for a large nuclear decommissioning loss which gave rise to tax benefits.
Can you just update us on where you stand in that process and has the IRS issued any type of ruling on the position that you took? Are you talking about -- when you say filed for loss? Are you talking about the tax deduction we took? Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right.
Okay.
No that's going to be a long time before that gets resolved most likely.
We had the -- if you're talking about the deduction that we took actually I think on the 2009 return associated with the decommissioning liability at the Northeast plants that -- by the time that comes up to audit cycle by the time we get through review and wherever that's going to go it'll be quite a while before we have resolution unless something comes up to settle it sooner.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And we should assume that you're not taking or that you haven't taken any of those NOLs as a credit towards earnings? Or is that not the case? Well to the extent that we had resolution for example in the recent tax settlement those things -- the recent IRS settlement is kind of an outgrowth of all of that.
There was a combination of benefit from the tax positions that we took plus we utilized about $2.5 billion of the NOL at that point in time.
So those do get taken care of as we run through resolution of those issues to the extent that there is a reserve against those.
And we'll go next to Daniel Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Just looking at some of your long-term planning assumptions that you provided in the fall I guess my first question is the $4 billion to $5 billion you thought you could return to shareholders in a lower commodity-priced environment how is that number being affected? Are you guys still seeing yourselves within that band? And what kind of credit metrics we'll be watching to understand where you could fall out against that number? We would still see ourselves in that band at the amount of repurchases we've done since then plus the current dividend.
We're already at the bottom end of that.
Commodity price movements the acquisition of RISEC things like that impact the distributable cash flows and how those will work.
And recall that from a buy back point of view we're really focused -- the buybacks come from either the EWC business the commodity-market based business or unique events like asset sales or things like that.
So we still see ourselves in that range but arguably with today's commodity prices that puts us down in a range rather than up.
Research Division</strong> And Leo what kind of metrics should we be looking at most specifically as far as coverage ratios and that sort of thing to kind of calibrate where the balance sheet should be? In terms of which ones? I'm sorry you were a little bit...
Research Division</strong> Yes I guess add flow[indiscernible] interest what kind of cover around metrics are you guys focused on? Well we don't really disclose targets of where we're trying to go with those.
Our metrics have traditionally been very strong within our ratings category.
Our debt-to-capital ratio usually hovers around that 55% debt-to-cap on a gross basis.
We focus mostly on maintaining a significant amount of liquidity to manage the business both the needs of the Utility but also obviously within UDPWC.
But typically we strive for and we accomplish cash flow metrics that are reasonably strong within the ratings category we are to.
But we don't give out specific targets or anything like that.
Research Division</strong> Okay and I think just one last question.
I know there's a lot of work that you've done on the ITC transaction but when you look at that 6% to 8% compound earnings growth do you guys feel comfortable at those numbers even if just on the traditional distribution business? Is it traditionally Utility businesses x Transco if you'll look out between now and '14? Well the 6% to 8% objective included the transmission business.
We haven't done anything as Wayne said to reset what would look like once we accomplish the spin and those are obviously they went through 2014 anyway.
So we really haven't -- we don't really have an update on those.
We'll look at those as we go forward.
Certainly the transmission business is a -- has a lot of capital associated with it but so does generation.
The biggest CapEx to depreciation spread is in transmission but the biggest numbers are in generation.
And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Research Division</strong> So I wanted to first address Arkansas as we are looking towards the MISO and ITC transaction and transition respectively.
Specifically as far as contingencies go I mean I know we're still a little bit ways away from end of 2013 but I just wanted to hear a little bit about -- could Arkansas go independent for a little bit just to --  how much of a hard deadline is the end of 2013 vis-a-vis Arkansas and getting this all done? This is Gary and I'll start with the end part.
December 2013 is a firm and fixed date.
They -- we have the System Agreement in that date and we've got to be prepared for them to have an option.
Until that point we really have been proceeding with really 3 options.
One is basically the RTO with it going to MISO and then there's a little one that would probably most likely if we were not to get there is we got also the -- it's a stand-alone option.
That's obviously not the one that's in the best interest of our customers and the one that would be more costly.
But we've been proceeding with all of those options kind of simultaneously.
As soon as we can get an answer from the commission hopefully here in June then we would basically terminate those others.
Research Division</strong> At what point do you need to make a formal notification? Let's say end of this year it doesn't look like you've gotten -- have a determination in hand or what have you do need to make a decision with respect to investments to get yourself ready to transition to an independent system for whatever period of time? We are actually making those investments consistently at the same time right now.
So the reality is we're spending money for both options and the sooner we can get one we would actually terminate one.
But we're were assuming that we could go through the end of this year holding both those options open until the commission makes a decision.
And we need to file with FERC in 2013 for our intention of where we plan to go.
We have [indiscernible].
Research Division</strong> All right.
Great.
Did I cut you off there? No that was fine.
Research Division</strong> All right.
And then finally just a follow-up on the EWC side.
In terms of the recent scrutiny at the Palisades just kind of commenting around how you guys intend to change operationally your operation of that unit? I'll give it to John here and our Chief Nuclear Officer.
John? Julien this is John.
A couple of things first while we're certainly disappointed with some of the performance issues that we've had at Palisades.
I can assure you that not only the leadership team at the site along with our corporate leadership has put a lot of attention on this facility to make sure that we turn the tides here.
We've had multiple meetings with the NRC assuring them not only what the cause of some of these issues were but what corrective actions we've taken in making sure that the entire organization at Palisades is engaged with making sure that we don't continue to make some of these same performance errors.
But we've definitely had significant oversight and making sure that the leadership team there is very focused on turning around this performance at that facility.
Research Division</strong> Just as a follow-up is there a key review date that we should be looking forward to there sort of a key decision move forward date for NRC in terms of kind of unflagging the unit or anything like that? We're still working with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on 2 issues and we haven't got their final review on that.
Typically when you have something like this you'll have a root cause -- you'll have the corrective actions and then typically about a year when you're able to sit down with the regulatory body and then go through -- making sure the corrective actions that you've taken have resolved the issue and that you're assured yourself that these types of issues won't continue.
So it's early to say right now what the final date's going to be but it typically runs about a year from the time you get the final report from the regulatory body.
And we'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Just to follow-up on Paul Fremont's question on Vermont Yankee.
It sounded like there was sort of just generic things like interest rates and what have you that changed the impact of the decommissioning liability.
And I'm wondering is there any possibility that could happen at other plants? It has happened.
And we've done some of these in the past but there's no schedule for some of those plants at the moment.
This was something that we did as a result of our agreement with Vermont when we acquired the plant.
So typically there's -- if there's some rationale for doing that you'll go through that process.
But right now there really wouldn't be for the other plants.
Okay so there's nothing really on the horizon that could happen in that area? Not at the moment.
Okay and then just with respect to the ITC transmission.
I'm sorry if I missed this but any sort of follow-up with respect to discussions with Utility regulators in terms of their -- by that I mean sort of the local state regulatory folks how they're looking at this and how they -- did their discussions there how they're responding? Well yes I'd mentioned that we planned on at least 2 rounds with our regulators before we make our filing to make sure that we're addressing all the issues that are on their mind.
We've had the first round.
Rob and I are doing this personally.
The second-round starts next week.
But the main issues as you are aware we haven't really heard any immediate reaction from our regulators publicly.
They've reserved judgment until they see the filing.
Obviously they've heard over the last 2 years from a number of parties that in technical conferences that they believe independence is paramount to our system particularly given the magnitude of the merchant generators.
They've heard that over and over and over again.
So I think the details of how we would plan on proceeding with this what impact it may have on customer rates what impact it has on their own authority and ability to influence the construction plan things of that nature they're going to want straight answers to those questions.
And we think we've got good answers for those questions.
We wouldn't have done the deal.
But we'll like I told Steve I think the Steve Fleishman earlier I'll reserve judgment on that until this next round and see if that after they've thought about it new issues arise.
I don't expect new issues to arise.
But again the good news is that they have not come out with a premature opinion of the transaction.
They're waiting to see exactly what we filed and that's what the regulators should do.
Okay so it's pretty much sort of what you're kind of -- within the range of what you had expected in terms of reaction is that a good way to characterize it? I think it's -- I think yes yes I think it's in like I said it's in the range of what good regulators should do and all the times across the country you've seen regulators react before the filings and we haven't seen that with our regulators and we appreciate that.
And we'll take our last question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> I just wanted to make sure I was clear on the -- your comments relative to the earnings guidance range guys.
So does the -- you said you would expect to be at the lower end of guidance.
Does that include the assumption that you've completed the sort of amount of the buyback that's already been completed but exclude any future buyback or does it exclude that totally? Well the guidance range that we provided Greg excluded any repurchases similar to the guidance range that we gave last year.
So within that same set of assumptions which includes no buybacks we would point towards the bottom of the range.
Research Division</strong> Okay but you've already executed a small portion of it? We executed some buyback last year.
Research Division</strong> Okay and should we presume that given how soft the commodity environment is and that sort of -- obviously the impact that would have on cash flow that you would be less anxious to complete the buyback in the next 12 to 18 months? Or is your decision on when to complete the shareholder value return program sort of independent of what's going on in that space? The commodity prices are a factor as they relate to free cash flow.
And so that's a factor that's considered.
There's -- I wouldn't want to imply that we are preprogrammed to take an action on that regardless of what's going on there.
So to the extent obviously the cash flow's better that gives us more flexibility to the extent that it's a little bit tighter because of where the commodity prices are and then that's going to give us pause.
Because it impacts not only our cash flow and our liquidity but certainly we've always got to keep an eye on credit metrics and all of that.
So it's certainly a major factor in the buyback particularly given the fact that the buyback is really geared towards distribution of capital that comes out of the commodity-based businesses at EWC.
And that concludes our question-and-answer session.
I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms.
Waters for closing remarks.
Lynn and thanks to all for participating this morning.

Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Wayne.
Thanks Paula.
Good morning everyone.
The theme of our 2011 Annual Report to Stakeholders is Adapting to a Changing World.
Given the schedules involve for design and illustration each year we must select our theme 4 to 5 months in advance of production and distribution.
As it turns out looks like -- so now it looks like we have a foreknowledge of what was to come.
It would be except in Philosophy 101 you learn 2 things on day 1.
The first is the beginning of all wisdom is to know thyself.
The second is the only constant in life is change.
For some time we've been communicating to you our plans and initiatives to address risks or uncertainties and given our strengths and limitations to adapt to the coming reality that we are now facing.
Today I'll update you on where we stand and will provide a context for our accomplishments and our challenges.
Starting with one of our key utility initiatives the proposal for each of the utility operating companies to join a regional transmission organization specifically the Midwest Independent System Operator or MISO.
Events continue to move us closer to achieving that goal.
In a significant development last week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued its order conditionally accepting MISO's tariff revisions regarding cost allocations for transmission projects upon introduced transition into the MISO RTO.
Just to remind you last September FERC denied MISO's request for tariff waiver to implement this same proposal.
Moreover FERC noted in its order that it was not making any findings on the merits of the proposal at that time.
The request for the tariff waiver was just a wrong procedural vehicle to implement the proposal.
In the April 19 ruling on the merits FERC founded that it was just and reasonable for MISO and its existing transmission owners to agree to establish a transition period to ensure that no entity must bear the cost of transmission facilities from which it has not been showing the benefit consistent with traditional cost causation principles.
Prior to this FERC ruling on March 16 Entergy Arkansas reached a settlement with its Arkansas co-owners in its coal-generating plants including Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation one of the intervenors in the FERC proceeding.
The settlement will include how the plant will operate after Entergy Arkansas integrates into MISO.
This agreement extends the benefits of MISO participation to all co-owner utilities if the Arkansas Public Service Commission approves the Entergy Arkansas' proposal to join MISO.
Combined with Entergy Arkansas these groups represent 80% of all Arkansas electric customers in the state.
In addressing other concerns utilities have agreed to give the Entergy Regional State Committee upon unanimous vote the authority to direct the operating companies to add projects within the Entergy region to MISO's transmission expansion plan during the 5-year transition period after the Entergy utilities join MISO.
This arrangement is designed to address concerns expressed by regulators.
FERC's reason is based on [ph] transmission cost allocations along with the additional authority to add projects to help address the stated concerns on MISO and provide a wider path for the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and for a seamless and successful integration and realization of up to $1.4 billion to projected net customer savings over 10 years.
This projected cost of benefits derived from its joining in RTO with substantial scale in a mature Day 2 market.
As you know Day 2 refers to an RTO that includes day-ahead and real-time energy markets and uses market-based mechanisms to manage congestion.
The Day 2 market brings about efficiencies by using 1 central unit commitment and dispatch based on the economics of transmission and generation resources.
MISO has one in place today SPP does not although it has plans to.
Even assuming SPP will get there further independent third-party analysis has recently undercut the arguments of those who have opposed our proposed move to MISO.
In a study prepared by the Charles Rivers Associates for SPP SPP is the one that commissioned the study CRA estimates that SPP members would receive $22 million in trade benefits over the 10-year span from 2013 through 2022 as a result of the Entergy and Cleco regions entry into MISO.
Not only that this study projects that those same SPP members would see an increase in net production cost of $17 million if the Entergy and Cleco regions joined SPP instead.
At the retail jurisdictions and testimony filed [ph] in March in Louisiana all parties except SPP conditionally [ph] support or do not oppose at least the move to MISO.
Hearings are scheduled to begin next week in Louisiana and at the end of May in Arkansas with potential decisions coming in at summer.
Regulatory proceedings are also underway or will be soon in Mississippi New Orleans and Texas.
Based on the established procedural schedules or in the case of Texas a 180-day requirement we currently anticipate having final decisions on our MISO proposal in all retail jurisdictions by the end of the third quarter or early in the fourth.
Of course joining RTO is critical to our transaction with ITC Holdings to completely separate Entergy transmission's business to a spinoff and subsequent merger.
Joining MISO is an incremental step in improving our business model.
But the ITC transaction is transformational offering customers and other stakeholders the opportunity to benefit from complete independence the advantages of scale and at the same time greater function.
Over the past 3 months we have continued our outreach efforts in conjunction with ITC to obtain the input and perspective of our regulators and other stakeholders.
With the benefit of greater understanding from these discussions we are preparing to make initial retail regulatory filings beginning around midyear.
As I said before we fully intend for those filings to further explain our view in spinning off and merging our transmission business with an independent transmission company at the caliber of ITC provides a solid platform for the future.
There are no perfect solutions to any long-term issues of public policy.
There are however options.
Sometimes the idea is simply bold and exciting but the potential for success is a huge leap of faith with enormous risks.
Sometimes the idea is simply one whose time has come.
The potential and logic are compelling and success is highly likely.
We believe this is clearly the latter of the 2.
On balance we'll ask regulators to consider the net benefit of the transaction.
On the one hand gaining an independent transmission company in a footprint where even without deregulation the merged capacity is almost half the size of the regulated capacity in the region and who's sole focus is transmission versus on the other hand a change in jurisdiction as a result of distant [ph] merge.
Initiation processes related to other key approvals will follow.
The target to close a transaction remains in 2013.
Our incoming group President of Utility Operations Theo Bunting has been instrumental in developing the regulatory plan we are now executing.
Theo will take over the top Utility box on June 1 from Gary Taylor who announced his retirement earlier this year.
Gary is on his last earnings call today which he just reminded me of.
And he will certainly be missed.
But I know he would tell you that he's turning the Utility over to very capable hands.
Theo who is on the call with us this morning as well currently serves as Entergy's Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer.
In his 20-plus years at Entergy he had broad-based experience for anything from strategic and financial planning regulatory strategy and risk management to operational support areas including customer service.
He was the obvious choice.
Next I'll review -- briefly recap some other developments.
In Mississippi the annual formula rate plan volume was made in March for the 2011 test year period.
The evaluation report reflected an earning return on equity of 10.92% within the performance adjusted bandwidth therefore no change in rates.
In Louisiana the Public Service Commission approved Entergy Louisiana Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's application for the Ninemile 6 project on March 21.
As you'll recall earlier this year the New Orleans City Council authorized Entergy New Orleans' participation.
Ninemile 6 is a 550-megawatt new modern state-of-the-art natural gas-fired combined cycle plant we built on the existing Entergy Louisiana site.
With regulatory approvals in hand Entergy Louisiana is with full notice to proceed on its construction of Ninemile 6.
The new plant is expected to go in service in the first part of 2015.
As you know we disclosed in the fall of 2010 that we received a civil investigative demand by the U.S.
Department of Justice to investigate competitive issues concerning certain generation procurement dispatch and transmission system practices and policies of the utility operating companies.
Due to the confidential nature of this matter I am limited on what I can say today.
All I can say or more accurately all they will let me say is that it remains outstanding.
And we believe the documentation we provided to the DOJ demonstrates that our practices and policies have been appropriate and consistent with regulatory orders and industry practice.
With respect to our announced acquisitions of the Hinds and Hot Spring facilities the parties have satisfied their obligations under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act but the DOJ is still reviewing the transaction.
I do not know if the complexities of our discussions with DOJ will affect the timing of DOJ's review of the Hot Spring's and Hinds' transactions.
Obviously we don't think it should but you should be aware of that possibility.
Also at utility I'm proud to report that once again for the 14th consecutive year Entergy was recognized with its leadership in storm restoration.
This year we won both Edison Electric Institute's Emergency Recovery and Emergency Assistance Awards.
The 2012 hurricane season starts June 1.
And happily predictions call for a contained season but of course it only takes one.
So if a severe storm strikes we will be prepared as always.
At Entergy wholesale commodities Vermont Yankee nuclear plant entered the period with extended operation under its renewed Nuclear Regulatory Commission 20-year license on March 22.
Three days before that rulings by the Federal District Court and the Vermont Public Service Board provided the clarity we requested that VY would continue to operate while legal and regulatory proceedings are pending.
The Vermont Attorney General and the Vermont Department of Public Service have stated their agreement with that and the Vermont Public Service Board has acknowledged this reality even if they don't agree.
On April 16 we filed our amended petition for a Certificate of Public Good for continued operations required by Vermont Public Service Board in their order to resume the proceeding in a new docket.
Vermont Yankee's continued operations supports the public good through employment taxes and other sources of government revenue to Vermont which together with the multiplier effect call for substantial economic benefits to the state.
Continued operation also provides for potential sharing of revenues offering value protection against higher energy prices in the future.
The Public Service Board has scheduled a status conference for May 2 which may shed some light on the time line.
Concurrently briefings in Vermont's appeal of the January district court decision to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York are likely to extend through most of 2012 assuming this process [ph] takes its maximum amount of time.
As said the decision is not expected until well under 2013.
At Pilgrim just a few days ago the NRC key staff issued a memorandum asking the NRC commissioners to authorize the issuance of the Pilgrim's renewed license.
A response was requested of the commissioners on their recommendation by May 8 that specifically noted that although a new late file contention has been referred to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board or ASLB when an appeal of an ASLB decision is pending upon the commission the NRC is not compelled to await exhaustion of those appeals before renewing the operating license.
This represents an important step.
That said though the commissioner has requested a decision from the ASLB on admissibility of the new late contention by no later than May 29.
That said they may wait until that day before taking any action.
With the license expiration date of June 8 just around the corner we're not there yet.
But in any event the NRC's timely renewal doctrine would apply to allow continued operation if the proceedings extend past June 8.
We continue to believe none of the items identified should preclude the issuance of Pilgrim's license renewal through 2032.
Regarding Indian Point NRC and state proceedings related to license renewal remains ongoing.
But we know you've been following with interest Governor Cuomo's Energy Highway initiative which has brought more attention to Indian Point.
First of all this initiative is very preliminary.
In the preliminary meetings to date the State of New York has not expressed the goal of closing Indian Point.
It has either good legal advice or good common sense instead the New York administration has identified the uncertainty regarding continued operation in light of other proceedings specifically license renewal and related state water quality proceedings.
The continued operation of Indian Point advances New York's stated goals and objectives and directly provides high value jobs to more than 1000 workers in the State of New York.
Indian Point's continued operation is essential to achieving environmental sustainability affordable energy and long-term reliability of electric systems.
Those interests were described and quantified in last summer's independent Charles Rivers Associates report prepared for New York City's Environmental Protection Department.
In other developments regarding Indian Point the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision on damage claims against the U.S.
Department of Energy for its breach of obligations regarding the spent fuel disposal contract for Indian Point units 1 and 2.
Assuming no further appeals are filed EWC could receive cash payments estimated to be in the range of $100 million in the next several months.
For our other nuclear plants damage claims for DOE's failure to begin disposal of spent fuel in 1998 are in various stages of planning or litigation.
While we had a number of tactical and strategic successes during the quarter financial results are negatively impacted by a number of items resulting in the decision to reduce our 2012 operational earnings range even though it is still early in the year.
In a few minutes Leo will review the details.
As he does keep in mind that in our view the underlying issues are either not new or are noncash or in some cases both.
First financial results in the quarter were negatively impacted by unseasonably mild temperatures this winter a reversal of the colder than normal weather over the past 2 years.
To put it in perspective the southern region had the third warmest first quarter in 118 [ph] years of record keeping.
In fact Arkansas and Mississippi set a record for the warmest March over that same time period with Louisiana and Texas not far behind at third and sixth warmest respectively.
In the context of long-term valuation credit cannot be given for the highest and lowest of course of weather.
But nevertheless the bottom line is we're out $32 million of cash after tax due to the weather.
Another factor reflected in our revised 2012 earnings outlook is the impact of historically low interest rates and the termination of pension expense.
As we discussed in our last earnings call in January final pension expense assumptions were different than what we assumed in setting guidance.
The discount rate was overestimated and we later received updated information on other pension assumptions.
Finally the 2 charges for the Vermont Yankee impairment and the regulatory asset writeoff are noncash in nature.
In the case of the regulatory asset customer rates are unaffected by the change -- by the charge I'm sorry.
Rather we had an asset recorded on our financial book on an accounting method that goes back to the Gulf States' acquisition in the mid-90s that was simply overstated.
For Vermont Yankee whatever you believe about the value of the plant that should not have changed because of the impairment charge.
Impairment cash as the accountants refer to it is a valuation that has been consistently performed and disclosed by use into state actions necessitated in 2010.
The ramifications of this low natural gas price environment is not unique to Vermont Yankee but the key for us was whether there has been a triggering event requiring an impairment evaluation as in the case of Vermont Yankee.
Due to Vermont Yankee's unique position in the courts this accounting valuation requires consideration of all potential outcomes resulting in a value that is discounted through a legal uncertainty.
This impairment reflects the result at March 31 of the applying the accounting rules applicable to VY utilizing our best judgment and in consultation with our external accounting advisers who have also been involved in our -- in other past accounting valuations.
This chart does not reflect a change in Entergy's point of view on the legal and state regulatory proceedings nor on the economic value of the plant based on our point of view assuming it operates for another 20 years.
In any event we could try to excuse the accounting issue as basically noncash and nonrecurring but it's our job to deliver results you expect and clearly we didn't.
That does not mean we've given up or thrown in the towel in 2012.
We will continue to work to meet or even exceed our original earnings guidance but the numbers just aren't there right now.
With natural gas and power prices continue to fall and gas inventories overflowing as well as the full trend of regulatory and legal challenges at the utility and EWC it sometimes seeing some news is all negative.
It's not.
The Board of Directors and management team are focused on adapting to the world as it is and as it will be not how we wish it to be.
There are ever new challenges but there will be opportunities that come along with those changes.
For example initiatives like the MISO proposal and the ITC spin-merge transaction create real benefits for our customers and other stakeholders and reflect our first rule know thyself.
The structure delivers value we simply cannot do on our own.
There are others similar opportunities.
Commodity prices have a long history of volatility with today's bearish natural gas price levels which are likely to persist in the near-term we're closely examining our options to manage through this down cycle and at the same time prepare the business to capitalize on the option that markets improve.
But I should be clear about that.
While the current low prices do not appear sustainable the old days of double-digit natural gas prices do not appear to be realistic either.
For the economy for jobs for the environment for customers for sustainable growth abundant natural gas in moderate prices creates a promising future.
And while low prices may not be the best news for Entergy's merchant fleet we will adapt.
This brings me to the second rule change is constant but we will continue adapting not to losing but to new ways of doing business and creating more flexible flexibility agility and greater options.
And now I will turn the call over to Leo.
Thank you Wayne and good morning everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover first quarter 2012 financial results our cash performance for the quarter 2012 earnings guidance and some closing remarks.
Slide 2 summarizes first quarter as recorded in operational earnings results and Slide 3 outlines the major factors that drove the quarter-on-quarter results.
First I'll cover the 2 special items for the quarter.
These 2 items are included in As Reported results but are excluded from Operational results.
One special item is for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed spinoff and merger of Entergy's transmission business which we announced in December.
Spending on our spin-merge initiative reduced earnings per share by $0.04 in the quarter $0.03 at the Utility and the balance at Parent &amp; Other.
The other special item is for an asset impairment recorded at EWC for the Vermont Yankee asset.
Under generally accepted accounting principles long-lived assets are typically accounted for on a historical basis unless a triggering event occurs which results -- requires an impairment evaluation.
For Vermont Yankee the initial triggering event was in early 2010 when the Vermont Senate voted down a bill that would have allowed the Public Service Board to consider VY's application for a Certificate of Public Good.
The vote raised questions regarding the operation of the plant through 2032.
As a result of this vote and ongoing efforts by the state to shutdown Vermont Yankee early the plant has been evaluated for impairment under the accounting rules every quarter since the first quarter of 2010.
The accounting rules called for a 2-step process.
First the book value of the asset is compared to an estimate of future undiscounted or nominal net cash flows expected to result from ownership of that asset.
If the cash flows are equal to or higher than the book value of the plant no impairment is indicated and the test is complete.
Cash flow estimates consider future operating expenses and future market prices as well as the availability of the asset.
The impairment analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to probability weighted expected cash flows measured at the end of each quarterly period.
As you might expect the key driver for cash flow estimates is forward prices.
For impairment analysis we have consistently used observable market prices were available.
As you all know at March 31 those prices declined significantly which produced a different result this quarter.
Because the undiscounted cash flows were less than the book value of the plant we then performed step 2 of the analysis which compared the book value of the assets to the fair value as of March 31 2012.
Fair value is typically determined using discounted cash flows.
Because the fair value of the plant was less than the book value an impairment charge of $356 million pre-tax or $1.26 per share after-tax was recorded to reflect the fair value of the plant.
The write down represented approximately 70% of the book value of the assets and was allocated pro rata between plant construction work in progress fuel and deferred refueling outage costs.
While accounting details help to understand the actual impairment entry there are a few points that I'd like to emphasize.
To repeat a key point Wayne made earlier the impairment does not reflect the change in our view of the legal and state regulatory proceedings and the overall economic value of Vermont Yankee assuming we win and operate for 20 more years.
Also the impairment derives from the unique legal and state regulatory processes surrounding Vermont Yankee which make it uncertain that the plant will operate until the license expires in 2032.
Absent this uncertainty the evaluation for impairment would not have been required.
The Vermont Yankee impairment naturally raises questions about our other non-utility nuclear plants however Vermont Yankee is unique for the reasons I noted earlier.
As we sit here today no triggering event has occurred for any of EWC's other nuclear plants so no evaluation is required or planned.
However even if we had evaluated EWC's other nuclear plants using our current operating assumptions and the March 31 price assumption an impairment would not have been required.
Now let's turn to operational results.
Slide 3 summarizes the major drivers for operational earnings.
Utility results were lower than a year ago due primarily to higher income tax expense lower net revenue and higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense.
Utility income tax expense was higher due to a non-cash write-off of a regulatory asset associated with income taxes.
I won't repeat the same points that Wayne made in his remarks but there are a few details that I'd like to note primarily on the accounting aspects of this issue.
During the quarter Entergy Gulf States Louisiana determined that its regulatory asset for income taxes was overstated because of the difference between the regulatory and the accounting treatment of certain income tax items primarily those associated with pension expense.
In the regulatory construct there are 2 methods for determining how much income tax expense are included in the customer rates normalization and flow-through.
At a very high level normalization follows GAAP income tax expense while flow-through follows income tax payment.
While normalization is typically the preferred method some jurisdictions do use flow-through for various items.
EGSL's retail rates were developed using the normalization method but the financial accounting assumed that rates were being set using the flow-through method which had actually been the case prior to the GSU merger.
As a result EGSL's accumulated regulatory asset for future recovery of income tax expenses that were already being recovered in rates.
The normalized method has been appropriately applied to income taxes associated with pension expense in rate making.
As a result this adjustment has no impact on customer rates.
The disconnect was in our financial accounting assumption and the noncash write-off aligned the regulatory asset with the regulatory treatment.
Utility net revenue was lower this quarter than a year ago due largely to unfavorable weather in the current quarter compared to favorable weather last year.
As Wayne noted weather was significantly warmer than normal this quarter.
Excluding the effects of weather retail sales increased 3.3% which was consistent with our expectations.
Sales volumes were higher across all customer classes.
Industrial sales were up 4.6% as the positive effects of facility expansions continued.
Weather adjusted residential sales increased 2.6%.
Growth was particularly strong in the Louisiana jurisdictions.
Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense also contributed to the lower earnings results.
Higher O&amp;M was partly due to increased compensation and benefits expenses which was driven by higher benefits cost.
We noted on our fourth quarter call in January the pension expense would be higher than planned due to a lower discount rate as well as other updated pension assumptions.
Utility also had higher fossil expenses due partly to the Acadia acquisition which is offset by higher net revenue from the rate action associated with that acquisition.
Higher fossil outage expense also contributed to increased O&amp;M a portion of which is considered timing.
Slide 4 summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for the quarter for the quarter of the current and previous year.
This quarter's operational adjusted EBITDA declined due primarily to lower net revenue and increased nonfuel operation and maintenance expense.
EWC's net revenue decreased compared to the first quarter of last year due to lower energy pricing for its nuclear fleet.
Prices were down for both contracted sales as well as power sold at market.
The average contracted price was $50 and the average price sold at market was approximately $30.
Decreased generation from the nuclear fleet also contributed to the decline in net revenue.
Build sales were down less than 1% in slightly higher planned and unplanned outage days.
Lower net revenue from the nuclear portfolio was partially offset by an increased net revenue from the non-nuclear assets largely due to the RISEC plant acquired in late 2011.
Higher nonfuel operation and maintenance expenses also contributed to the decrease in adjusted EBITDA.
The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense which includes pension expenses.
Before we leave EWC I'd like to mention one item in our earnings release.
Starting this quarter we've expanded the sold-forward table to include details for EWC's non-nuclear plants.
The Additional Information will provide details on the energy and capacity sold as well as expected net revenue for that portfolio at a point in time.
Parent &amp; Other operational results declined due to several individually insignificant items.
Slide 5 provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the quarter.
Operating cash flow for the current quarter was roughly $600 million about $280 million higher than the same quarter last year.
The increase was due to lower pension funding and lower working capital requirements.
These increases were partially offset by lower net revenue.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 operational earnings guidance which we recently updated to $4.85 $5.65 per share.
Several items weren't considered in our revised guidance range some of which we discussed on our last quarterly call.
Pension expense for the year will be higher than planned due to a lower discount rate and other updated assumptions.
Market power prices have continued to decline since our original guidance was issued.
As of the end of the quarter average pricing for the unsold nuclear portfolio was $30 for the full-year compared to $46 assumed in guidance.
Weather was significantly unfavorable in the current quarter.
The regulatory asset writeoff noted earlier also reduced earnings.
Operating expenses at VY specifically fuel refueling outage amortization and depreciation will be lower going forward as a result of the asset impairment.
The ongoing effect for 2012 is estimated to be $0.14.
This affect declines over the next few years due to the effects of the write-down of the shorter-lived fuel and deferred refueling outage assets.
Slide 7 provides details on the ongoing effects by category.
Opportunities to offset some of the factors that have gone against us so far include reductions in non-fuel operation and maintenance expense lower than planned interest expense based on financings completed to date and potential income tax benefits incremental to the original plan.
Our updated 2012 As Reported earnings guidance of $3.55 to $4.35 per share includes specials recorded through the first quarter but does not reflect any potential future expenses for the special item in connection with the proposed spin-merge of Entergy's transmission business.
As Reported earnings guidance will be updated to reflect the special item as actual costs are incurred throughout 2012.
Before we close I'll provide some details on our recently completed credit facilities.
On March 9 we competed new 5-year credit facilities totaling $4.15 billion for the parent company and 4 of the operating companies.
Pricing terms for the parent facility is LIBOR plus 175 basis points drawn and 27.5 basis points undrawn.
These rates increased from 2007 levels but were in line with other recent utility transactions.
Circumstances like the spin-merge transaction announced with ITC last fall caused us to delay this financing longer than we otherwise would have.
Though not by design or any attempts to time the market the final terms achieved reflected improved market conditions from the levels a year ago.
In February 2011 estimated pricing was at 200 basis points drawn and 30 basis points undrawn.
Assuming $1.5 billion drawn today's terms compared to a year-ago yield approximately $4 million per year lower cost.
Since Hurricane Katrina we have obtained significant improvements in our liquidity position.
At the end of 2004 we had $1.6 billion in credit facilities and negative storm reserves.
At the end of the first quarter we have $4.3 billion in credit facilities of which $2.8 billion is available.
We also have storm reserve escrow accounts in Louisiana Mississippi and New Orleans totaling $336 million.
These improvements give us confidence that we are prepared to quickly address a wide range of potential events that could affect our liquidity including storms.
This is especially important as we move into the summer and hurricane season.
As we look ahead we continue to work to create value for all of our stakeholders by focusing on both operational excellence and portfolio management.
For operational excellence we manage our everyday costs and look for ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness through continuous improvement efforts.
All of our employees focus on safety and operational excellence to get optimum performance from our assets.
License renewal and legal efforts to ensure our ability to run our nuclear plants during extended license period is also a priority.
We also work to effectively communicate and demonstrate that our plants are safe and secure and beneficial to the communities they serve.
We look for ways to provide benefits to our customers and sound investments to improve safety and reliability and improve efficiency.
We also focus on risk management to understand the risks in our business such as the declining commodity price environment that we've seen over the past few years.
And we look for ways to mitigate those risks such as new hedging strategies consistent with our point of view.
On portfolio management we create meaningful benefits in all of our businesses for our customers and other stakeholders with initiatives like the effort to join MISO which is projected to produce $1.4 billion in savings for our utility customers over a 10-year period.
Our proposal to spin off and merge the transmission business with ITC and independent Transco will benefit customers and other stakeholders with improvements in financial flexibility operational excellence in the independent and transparent ITC model.
EWC also explores ways to get the most out of its portfolio such as we did with the RISEC acquisition.
We also look for ways to create other opportunities and we continue to take steps necessary to maintain financial flexibility as reflected in solid credit metrics and strong liquidity.
The bottom line is that the utility fundamentals are still strong.
Weather-adjusted sales were good we have a constructive investment program and our strategic initiatives like MISO and ITC which will benefit our customers and other stakeholders are progressing.
As Wayne said it doesn't mean we won't work very hard to overcome these near-term issues.
It simply means that they are near-term.
EWC is obviously a different story with today's pricing environment and all the political issues.
But we are also working to preserve and enhance the value of that option through our regulatory strategy operating model and market-facing activities.
But in both cases our long-term strategies to manage risks remain financially solid and rationally grow the businesses remain intact.
Our management team is focused on accomplishing the goals we've set out and to move us towards our overarching goal of creating and delivering sustainable long-term value to all of our stakeholders.
And now our senior team is available for your questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Just in terms of the ITC transaction.
I guess listening to ITC and what have you it sounds like you guys are planning on doing a filing in the retail jurisdictions in the summer of this year and I can't recall a transaction on which it took that long between the announcement and the actual filings to take place.
And I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what's going on there and how your conversations are going on with the regulators.
Okay I'm going to let Gary Taylor since this is his last call get a chance to speak here.
Thanks Wayne.
I think actually it's gone as we would have planned.
Early on we talked about the fact that it was very important for our regulators to focus on the RTO transition piece and then file that up as there was more clarity with the transmission program through ITC.
And that's what we've done.
And so if you look at the timing we want to make sure that all the hearings were down.
And they've all been scheduled and clearly those will be completed this summer with the ruling from each of the commissions on an RTO.
The second part was that we wanted to also ensure that many of the commissions had ex parte rules and we wanted to have meaningful conversations with each of them so when we made the filings this summer that they were complete and address the concerns that they had.
With that we're on schedule to do that as Wayne has said to meet our goal of both the transition to the RTO by December of 2013 as well as supporting the closing of the deal with ITC by the middle of 2013 as well.
So very much it's been consistent and as far as regulators in general they've been very open and very objective and I think with what the staff is seeing is a very logical way to address it.
I'll just add one thing.
Gary made a good point yesterday in that -- I know you've all many of you have talked to the regulators you've heard statements by the regulators and if you go back to MISO where we were at in that process and they were well down the road on MISO now but the ITC were basically is where we were on MISO at this point in time.
With the regulators taking a wait-and-see approach waiting to hear the testimonies waiting to see exactly how we are going to address some of these issues and that's their job.
And on MISO once the numbers were put on the table and they could see what the trade was then it's been very positive ever since.
And so maybe it appears a little slow at someone out of the box but we expect that once we make the filings that things will pick up pretty fast.
Okay.
And just in terms of the flexibility of the transaction if one of the states I mean you're dealing with a variety of states there if one of the state pulls out I mean just somebody says no objects I guess is better way to put it.
I mean how flexible are you guys in terms of dealing with that or any potential change? I guess settlement what have you how flexible is the transaction do you think in terms of dealing with that potential situation from developing? Gary? I was just kidding Gary about that one.
I was going to give him all the questions today just as a sort of surprise.
I'm surprised! Leo you want to take that? Sure sure.
Paul that's just not a place that we're going to go.
We anticipate that we're going to get make it the same case in every jurisdiction in terms of the benefits and then we'll get this done across the board.
Certainly there is considerations about the structure we picked and the transaction that we've struck.
So it's not just a regulatory approval of the rate case or something like that where we've got a lot of flexibility around our structuring of this we have a transaction to preserve and structure that transaction to preserve.
So there's really nothing I can comment on there.
Okay.
And just the middle of the next year is what we're thinking about still here? There's been a lot of discussion about that and what we've said is next year.
And it would be nice if it was in the middle of the year.
That's about as early as you could I think as you could reasonably project it could happen.
But we do expect it in next year but I would hesitate to pick a time period at this point.
Our next question comes from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.
Inc.</strong> Leo could I ask you to walk through Slide 7 again on the ongoing impact from Vermont Yankee? I'm not clear I understand what all those different categories are.
The categories have to do with the items that are part of the plant balance.
From an accounting point of view there's the plant itself and that's the one that you can look at from a depreciation standpoint that's the value of the plant on the books that's depreciated every year.
Since we took the impairment for a portion of the plant balance that will reduce depreciation expense going forward.
The deferred fuel or the fuel outage costs and the fuel itself also given the way outages work if you think about it you were buying the fuel upfront and you have so much of it that comes out every cycle and you have costs associated with the fueling outage you could amortize over a period of time those are just shorter-lived assets.
So you allocate the impairment across the asset group of the fuel deferred outage costs and the plant balance then those would be ongoing as long as those what you've written off you won't have to write off over the period of which those would have been amortized.
So the fuel and the outage costs have a short life.
The plant obviously has a life through the end of the license so the depreciation expense goes down through the remainder of the life.
Inc.</strong> Okay and that's another 20 years because you have the NRC extension? Correct correct.
Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Research Division</strong> I'd be curious to get your perspective you mentioned it briefly earlier on the RFI on New York State regarding on incremental transmission and power development.
Just wanted to get first your perspective on how these upgrades might change the need ultimately for Indian Point? Secondly the timing of any such outcomes again you eluded to clearly sort of an initial look at the potential moving forward of this project? And finally what is your expectation of the outcome here clearly transmission and power upgrades being considered? So I'll leave it to you guys.
That's an excellent question.
Certainly one that Rick who's actually moved out of New York and is very involved in it and John also.
And we've been following and been very involved in a lot of the details of what is going on and what is likely to happen.
So I'll let Rick kind of summarize where we come out on that one.
Okay Julien I mean as you think about the energy highway objectives I mean it's everything that we think makes good sense for long-term utility planning.
And I think you start with that they're looking at they have a lot of generation up North north of the state west of the state that isn't fully utilized a lot of wind generation out West.
And what they're looking at is trying to eliminate some of those constraints and try to give an opportunity of some of that generation serving the lower part of the state.
And they are also looking at the long-term reliability the electric systems and as most states do in the Northeast they have a pretty aggressive policy around renewable generation how that could be developed.
So I think as it relates to need there's plenty of excess generation in the North and the West and so that will drive a lot of transmission projects.
Makes a lot of sense also from a little bit the intent of what the governor laid out create more jobs.
So you're going to build a lot of transmission with a nuclear I mean renewable portfolio out West looking at more sustainable environmentally friendly generation.
But 2 things that we think they've laid out as part of their intent is also to maximize rate payer value adhere to market rules and procedures and maintain the overall reliability of the system.
And I think that all plays well with the Indian Point unit as has been laid out in the past.
Both the New York ISO the CRA study the Public Service Commission itself Indian Point satisfies all those objectives very well.
As it relates to timing anytime you're coming in or their going through an RFI process they just had another meeting about a week ago I think it was and their expression of interest are supposed to be filed by the end of May.
And then the task force is looking at potentially identifying some of those requests for interest to maybe take to the next step which would be they'd issue a -- and it won't be the task force that's going to have to be probably the utilities themselves request for proposals around particular projects.
So as it relates to anything like that that's going to take a while to kind of work through that work it back through the New York ISO process and the Public Service Commission process and then you eventually get to real projects probably a couple of years down the road.
And I think a lot of them probably will be transmission.
So I think as the timing is going to take a couple of years to play out and I think the outcome will be more transmission than generation.
I think there is enough generation in the state it's just not all in the optimum places.
Yes all I need is Rick could expand on or even Mark could expand on that issue.
From the reliability standpoint even though over the years we've developed in the industry a number of devices that can help there is no replacement for local generation it is just good.
If you're talking about reliability you can have all the energy all the capacity.
And we are pushing it down wires no matter how big they are or how many devices you put on them local generation is absolutely critical to maintain reliability.
And these are like 2000 megawatts optimally positioned in New York.
And no plan that you are going to come up with is going to produce an expected reliability level as good as one that includes Indian Point.
It's just that simple.
Research Division</strong> Maybe kind of looking a little bit taking a different direction more directed towards Leo.
I saw the refinancing in the quarter January obviously taking some more off the revolver.
What is the expectation as you stand here today with regard to pushing more of that off to revolver into long-term financing? Is it baked into your '12 is it another '12 issuance or are we talking 2013 and beyond at this point? And maybe more structurally are you looking to proceed any kind of further refinancing with any kind of transactions of any sort? As far as the parent company goes if you go back in time prior to the spinoff announcement the nature of our term versus liquidity at the parent is pretty much in the same position now as it has been.
So I wouldn't expect major changes on that all other things being equal in terms of pushing more from the revolver to term or anything like that.
As it relates to transactions when we look at the majority of the transactions that we've got keyed up for example the power plant acquisitions or even the ITC transactions those are operating company financings.
So if you think about the power plants at a specific jurisdiction those jurisdictions do their own financing for those power plants.
And in the ITC transaction when you think about the financing that we'll do associated with that separation it will be to a fixed -- to alter the balance sheets to the right size of the operating companies themselves.
So from a transactional standpoint of anything that we've got out there right now that's all related to the operating companies.
And I think that all other things being equal the parent company has got the right mix of the facility term debt right now.
Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> Wayne you kind of mentioned this issue of the DOJ investigation from a couple of years ago and tie it into the Hinds transaction.
Is it just the issue that those transactions need to be approved by DOJ so that's how they might end up the getting tied together? Well it's speculation.
I mean it's just speculating on logic in terms of you have 1 agency with 2 things in front of them.
And people sometimes tend to want -- not want to let go of one until they see the outcome of the other.
We don't know that.
I'm just -- I'm trying to do is to bring up the issue of we don't know really what's going at DOJ and whether they would somehow relate the two.
We don't think they're related.
But I want to make you aware of that possibility that it could get delayed.
Not necessarily because they are tied together but because it's 1 agency with 2 different things they're working on for 1 company.
Research Division</strong> Yes okay.
And then secondly on New York is there any schedule on ruling on the water treatment issues at Indian Point? Any update on the hearings for that the Wedgewire cooling towers? Yes go ahead Chuck.
Yes Dave this is Chuck Barlow.
There will be -- it will be a relatively slow summer.
There will be a couple of wrap-up type hearings on some issues that have already actually been tried.
This summer there is some briefing post-trial briefing going on this summer but the other issues that we have outstanding such as what is actually the technology that will be required looks like it will definitely go into 2013 as we look at having and wrapping up that trial.
So we don't see the likelihood of any incremental decisions being made by the administrative law judges or any final decisions being made on the water quality front before that.
Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Wayne you made comments about the market cycles for power generation and how things are tough now and they're likely going to be tough for another couple of years but they're not going to be tough forever.
And I also think about your companies and your leadership history of being what I would call a contrarian buyer meaning there weren't so many guys who went out and bought nuclear plants at a couple of hundred bucks per kilowatt back in the late '90s early 2000s.
Are there -- when you look at the merchant power markets today are you seeing opportunities that have the similar value creation potential to the ones you saw in the late '90s early 2000s around nuclear? And if so are there specific either asset classes or markets that attract you the most? Well if I had the benefit of hindsight I could 10 years from now I could tell you which ones will fit that description.
When we bought the nuclear we never expected the prices to be as high as they were for a period of time there.
And we don't see that certainly happening again for really any asset class.
Probably the most certain thing that when you look at it is environmental regulations are going to get tougher now.
Probably not nearly as tough as EPA has outlined which is just a point of view that is going to work its way and will be played out in probably the courts over the period in time.
And there will be assets that people don't view as having much value that will probably have a lot longer life than people think.
But I think from our perspective there's a lot of opportunity because we have a number of companies that are feeling the pressure of these low prices and they're looking for -- to reduce the risks that they were [ph] out with these assets.
And we do have the advantage of having really clean well located plants.
And so I think there are opportunities available.
I wouldn't get in depth to any particular detail but to work with some of the other companies who have merchant capacity fleets and who develop a more robust kind of portfolio that would rather than bet on any one particular kind of future.
I know that's not being very specific but we're spending a lot of time on this and there's a lot of interest I can say that with a number of other companies in terms of trying to figure out how they work their own way through this also.
It's a very uncertain time because I mean you have to -- it's not like one thing you're betting on.
There's just a lot of different issues that could swing one way or the other.
Research Division</strong> I would argue all times are like that and it just depends on where you are in the cycle right? Are there -- would you prefer to add concentration in markets where you already participate in where you already have physical presence versus expand into other markets? Yes absolutely.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And this one might be one for Rick.
Rick when do you expect rulings in the New York ICAP docket? We really don't know.
Research Division</strong> I mean it seems that it's been sitting in front of the FERC for a while just kind of sitting there.
Yes you're right.
I mean everybody has done their filings and stuff.
They're going to have to kind of make their own -- they're going to have to make a decision and we'll see where that goes after that.
They must be pretty busy with other things.
And we have time for one additional question and we'll go to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> I guess I was just kind of thinking about the ITC transaction and as you guys have had a chance to spend some time with the different commissioners and staff members.
How are you maybe verbalizing the value proposition of having ITC run the system? Obviously there is real cost benefit that the MISO involvement as you guys have demonstrated but with the higher cost of capital and that sort of thing what value are you guys trying to really sell them on to get them on board with the deal? Well I think I mentioned in the comments a lot of the advantages.
But clearly the scale they bring and the focus that they bring is unique and maybe that's a leap of faith that they will find ways to do things that we wouldn't necessarily.
But as you know all of our state regulators have been ever since the merchants came into our territory in these very large numbers they've been inundated with complaints and we've had various investigations and various requests for data and oversights and we have processes and to address all those issues and every single one of them it would always come up that we're doing things exactly right according to the rules and all that.
But there's always that suspicion that because you're in the business that you're not.
And that somehow something is being wrong or whatever -- being done wrong.
Some of us come from at least partial backgrounds like you all do in the trading business and in the trading business oversight only go so far.
It's separation of duties is everything.
And for the commission the oversight is with all this merchant capacity is sole owners and it never settles the question.
And so by separating the businesses any concerns that anybody has that there's anything going on here that's not in the best interest of everybody or consistent with the law and they've heard that over and over again from all the merchants and all the different parties and just the independence alone is what stakeholders want.
That's what we're giving them.
And then at the same time we still think there's enormous upside of having focus on that business.
And I think the main thing that we are emphasizing to them is what the stakeholders want is independence and these hearings they've tended to agree with the stakeholders that independence would be good.
And that's -- now they have the opportunity to achieve that.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then I guess Leo just to make sure I understood on the tax treatment the Louisiana income tax reset was unique to this period.
So kind of going forward there's not going to be anymore variation and we should assume a normalized tax rates up there? Yes.
You're talking about the Gulf States? Research Division</strong> Yes.
Yes.
At this time I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Thank you Lauren and thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release and website for Safe Harbor and Reg G compliance statements.
Our call is recorded and can be accessed on our website and by dialing (719) 457-0820 replay code 4034210.
The recording will be available as soon as practical after the transcript is filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
The telephone replay will be available through May 3 2012.
This concludes our call.
Thank you.
This concludes today's conference.
Thank you for your participation.
Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time for introductions and opening comments I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Wayne Leonard; and then Leo Denault our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] As part of today's conference call Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Wayne.
Thanks Paula.
Good morning everyone.
I'll start today with one of our key initiatives.
The proposal for the utility operating companies to join the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator or  MISO.
In May the Louisiana Public Service Commission became the first retail regulator to approve subject to certain conditions the proposal by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to transfer functional control of their transmission facilities to the MISO Regional Transmission Organization.
MISO change of control proceedings are in various stages of progress of the retail regulators in Arkansas Mississippi New Orleans and Texas.
During the second quarter the Arkansas Public Service and General Staff modified their position such that Entergy Arkansas should continue to progress toward joining MISO and when certain conditions are met the APSC will grant the full change of control.
An order from the Arkansas Public Service Commission could come at any time now.
Testimony has been filed in the remaining 3 jurisdictions and subject to various conditions.
Commission staff all the advisers and intervenors in each proceeding generally have been supportive of or at least have not expressed opposition to joining MISO with the exception of course of the Southwest Power Pool.
We believe we should receive all the retail commission orders on MISO in 2012.
Given this progress final preparations were underway now to initiate the regulatory approval process for the proposed spin-off and merger of the Entergy operating company's transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp.
The retail regulatory filings will describe on both a qualitative and a quantitative basis.
The benefits to customers and other stakeholders resulting from the superior independent model for transmission operations that ITC provide as well as the improved financial flexibility and strength of the Entergy Utility operating company following the completion of the transaction.
We expect to make the initial filings in Louisiana followed by filings in other retail jurisdictions at the Federal and Energy Regulatory Commission over the next few months.
Concurrently a fully functioning project management office is mapping out the process as activities and plans for the targeted 2013 closing to ensure a seamless transition.
In other Utility developments this quarter: Administrative Law Judges here in the Entergy Texas rate case issued their proposal for decision early July.
ALJs recommended an overall $16.4 million base rate increase.
However the staffs' working papers that were used by the ALJs indicate an approximate $28.3 million retail base rate increase.
Further the ALJs recommended a 9.8% allowed ROE.
This compares to the adjusted $105 million base rate increase an ROE of 10.6% that was requested by Entergy Texas.
We should note the recommendation affirmed in full Entergy Texas passed fuel costs and made no adjustments to $408 million of the capital additions or over 99% of affiliate costs.
That is the ALJs are not saying you are ineffective inefficient or improved.
Instead the ALJs recommendation results from while we believe our misapplications of basic regulatory principles and practices and these misapplications undermine the traditional rate-making process and public policy objectives.
The end result makes it impossible for Entergy Texas to earn a fair return and that is a clear violation of some of the oldest tested and affirmed principles of the regulatory law no matter how you can get there.
And particularly we believe certain adjustments are clearly without basis or merit.
For example approximately $30 million of purchased capacity cost incurred after the end of the test year within the allowed pro forma period when those rates will be in effect were suggested out with a sort of hyper-technical rationale that is at odds with the purpose of the regulation.
I won't go through all the disagreements we had with the ALJs recommendation but we strongly believe this is a fundamental misapplication of long-standing regulatory rules and practices in Texas which provide for recovery of known and measurable costs.
Under the ALJ's proposal these nonfuel costs could not be recovered for up to 2 years as the time it takes to prepare and complete another rate case that includes a full year of the cost to be reflected in the test year itself.
And if the timing isn't perfect between the test year and historical cost they may never be recovered.
That is why it is common practice in Texas and elsewhere to utilize pro forma adjustments to the test year to eliminate discrepancies particularly when you don't use a formula rate plan or have extensive use of riders.
Regarding regulatory decisions that discourage prudent capacity purchases that didn't pick us from [indiscernible] for the development of a robust efficient wholesale market if it's allowed to stand.
A public utility must be afforded the opportunity not only with showing its financial integrity but it can maintain its credit-rating and attract additional capital as needed but also of achieving returns on investment comparable to those of other companies having corresponding risk.
This is the law of the land and it is without argument.
And ALJ's recommendation fails to acknowledge in any way how this proposal lines up against that basic litmus test.
The PUCT is scheduled to take up the proposal for decision making at the August 17 meeting.
It is expected the final decision will be made at this meeting or by the next meeting on August 30 at the latest.
Entergy Texas has several other remedies available if the PUCT does not reverse the ALJ's recommendation.
Options include: Continuing to pursue the  open rule-making docket to establish a rider to recover capacity cost.
Filing for the authorized transmission and/or distribution riders to fully recover incremental investment costs above baseline set in the case preparing to file another base rate case if adequate recovery is not achieved in its proceeding and of course seeking relief through a legal process.
In Louisiana and New Orleans annual formula rate plan filings were made in May.
The Entergy New Orleans 2011 test  year FRP filing reflected earnings below the bottom of the bandwidth indicating the modest increase in electric and gas rates totaling approximately $4 million.
Entergy New Orleans also requested to accelerate funding of its cash storm reserves to allow to meet the $75 million target by 2017 that was established by the city council.
Under the FRP tariff new rates will be effective in the first billing cycle in October.
This year's filing follows 4 straight years of rate decreases in New Orleans.
Even with these file changes electric rates for Entergy New Orleans customers will be nearly 20% below 2011 levels across the country for non-hydroelectric utilities.
Furthermore rates for New Orleans customers will be among the 5 lowest in the country after factoring in a reasonable price for CO2 as a proxy for climate risk across the country.
The same general profile holds true for the rest of the operating companies explained in part the strong economic development activity in our region.
The earned return reflected in the 2011 test year FRP filing for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana was above the bandwidth indicating the cost of service decreased to $6.5 million.
In addition the company is requesting adjustments  outside the FRP primarily for lower capacity costs.
At Entergy Louisiana the FRP filing reflected 2011 earnings consistent with the bandwidth and therefore no cost of service adjustments are necessary.
While Entergy Texas earned within its bandwidth Entergy Louisiana earned within its bandwidth pursuant to the terms of the FRP the company is requesting rate adjustments outside the FRP for capacity cost for PPAs not covered under the fuel cost.
Both FRP filings with the LPSC are under review now and the FRP would require rate changes to be effective in September.
In addition Entergy Louisiana's recent FRP filing was supplemented to include the estimated the first year impact of the Waterford 3 generator replacement project.
Consistent with the previous LPSC order rates will be updated upon completion of the project subject to a standard prudence review.
The Waterford 3 project continues to meet provided milestones to achieve the planned end of 2012 in-service date.
In early July the steam generators arrived on site.
They are ready for installation during the fall refueling outage.
This Waterford 3 project is the second major capital project for the nuclear organization this year.
In the spring extended power outage project was installed at Grand Gulf during its  refueling hours that concluded in June.
Plant personnel are on the process now of increasing production after achieving the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval to operate at the higher power levels of 178 megawatts.
This 15% extended power upgrade will make Grand Gulf the largest single unit nuclear plant of its type in the country.
One last comment relative to generation initiatives.
In July the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas's request to acquire a hot spring power plant to set a special rider to recover the cost at the 10.2% ROE established in the most recent rate case.
This follows the first quarter 2012 certification by the Mississippi Public Service Commission for Entergy Mississippi to acquire the Hinds plant.
A federal proceeding on retail cost recovery remains pending in Mississippi.
Closing of the acquisition has been delayed pending the U.S.
Department of Justice review.
We do not know where the DOJ is with its review of the transaction or to the extent which its review has been or will be affected by the ongoing civil investigation of competitive issue of the Utility operating companies.
The confidential nature of the DOJ review of the transactions and the civil investigation do not allow me to comment beyond the fact that reviews are ongoing.
However I can repeat that we believe the operating companies' practices and policies and issue have satisfied all of applicable laws and regulations.
In other Utility matters last month the FERC issued a decision in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales case.
As a reminder this case consumes a limited amount of short-term wholesale energy sales less than 1/2 of 1% of the total system sales to third parties from 2000 to 2009.
The FERC found that the sales in question were allowed under the system agreement and made  and priced in good faith but disagree with after-the-fact accounting used to allocate the energy to supply those sales.
We believe our actions were consistent with the system agreement and as such have filed for rehearing last week.
The FERC also set for hearing a separate proceeding to determine a reallocation of cost among the operating companies consistent with its decision without completing the voluminous necessary calculations and therefore cannot quantify the effects of the reallocation on individual operating companies at this time.
We may not have a final FERC decision on this matter until 2014.
At Entergy Wholesale Commodities.
The NRC renewed Pilgrim's operating license through 2032  in late May about 2 weeks before the original license was scheduled to expire.
The decision by the NRC came after an extensive and rigorous review spanning a 76-month period where the NRC spent more than 20 000 hours conducting inspections and reviews and soliciting active stakeholder participation.
The stated goal of the NRC is to complete these reviews in 30 months.
While the Pilgrim license renewal was the longest to date it is almost certain to be surpassed by the Indian Point process given the number of issues and parties involved.
We filed a 20-year license renewal applications for Indian Point units 2 and 3 in April 2007.
The application day was more than 5 years before the expiration of the current operating licenses in September 2013 for Indian Point 2 and December 2015 for unit 3.
And as such meets the standard for the NRC's timely renewal provision which allows continued operation until the NRC takes action on the applications.
Current progress certainly points to timely renewal protection being applied for Indian Point 2 next year and likely for Indian Point 3 as well.
Since 2007 the United States issued a required safety evaluation report in 2009 and a supplemental environmental impact statement about a year later in 2010.
Both these safety and environmental reports issuance of the 20-year license renewal.
Supplement to these 2 reports are to be expected as the regulatory guidance council the NRC's ongoing oversight as well as when open issues are resolved.
Safety report was first supplemented in August of last year and another supplement is expected to be finalized by year end.
Around that time we're expecting the finalized first supplement to the environmental report.
We do not expect any of these supplements to change NRC staff's conclusion but there are no safety or environmental issues which would preclude the Indian Point units from operating safely for another 20 years.
The next milestone in the NRC process is the initial hearings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board scheduled to begin in October.
To date the ASLB has submitted a total of 16 contentions the most ever in a license renewal proceeding and the ASLB is on track to hear possibly 3 to 4 times more contentions than have ever been heard in a license renewal proceeding.
Two contentions have been resolved; 1 in the settlement the other in the commission order.
Ten of the 14 remaining contentions are slated for the track one hearing this fall.
No final schedule has been set for the remaining 4 issues.
NRC process allows for additional contentions to be filed after issuance of these supplemental reports or after any new maternal information comes to life.
And as we've experienced the Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee new contentions may be filed even after the records closed.
I won't go over all the details of each contention that would well take more time than you've got here today.
But suffice it to say these are complicated technical issues that take time to fully investigate resolve and document.
The key takeaway from all these discussions is that the nature of the rigorous process before the NRC indicates that it will be years until we reach final decision before the commission.
In conjunction with the NRC process we also need resolution on the water quality certification issue associated with the Clean Water Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination.
On the first issue.
Last year we filed notice with the NRC that the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation or DEC had not issued a final decision on our water quality certification application within the 1-year time period that is required by law.
The NRC has not ruled on our filing but if they agree that a waiver has occurred then a new water quality certification is not a requirement for NRC's issuance at Indian Point's renewed licenses.
In any event however Indian Point must comply with New York water quality standards to the proceeding on the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit or SPDES.
The department's ALJs have combined the water quality certification and SPDES issues into one joint proceeding now hearing that case in parallel with the NRC review of the waiver issue.
Periods before the ALJ for the New York State DEC will resume this week regarding the best uses of the Hudson River and on the efficacy of performance of the Wedgewire screen proposal that we've made.
These are just 2 of several issues in the water permitting certification proceedings.
But the central issue is the evaluation of what is the best technology available or BTA.
Operations with cooling towers or operations with our proposed Wedgewire screen alternative? And either of these options is required only if Indian Point is creating an adverse environmental impact.
A point on which we obviously disagree with the state and then we have preserved from further litigation at a later date.
Portions of these proceedings date back to 2003 when the New York State DEC issued a draft SPDES permit and proposed license renewal periods suggesting cooling towers are BTA.
Since then we filed expert testimony on how cooling towers don't meet the BTA standard for a host of reasons including that is highly unlikely that cooling towers can even gain the required air permit or approval by local governments due to zoning and other permitting issues.
And furthermore it is difficult to see how cooling towers could pass any reasonable cost-benefit test compared to Wedgewire screens which the U.S.
Supreme Court has ruled and be considered as an element of determining best technology available.
Staff of the New York DEC has not yet filed its primary report or the basis for why they regard cooling towers has BTA and no dates for hearing have been set for this threshold BTA issue to be argued in the sunshine before the assigned judges.
As it stands today we would expect these water quality proceedings to extend into at least 2013 and possibly well beyond that.
One last issue to report on water report.
The first gate under the law on water quality issues is whether Indian Point's operation has environmental impact on the Hudson River.
While the ALJ's declined to hear this argument in this proceeding it is fully supported by our research and evidence and ready to be presented on appeal to cooling towers somehow prevail in the joint water quality proceedings.
Secondly and I know all of this starts to blend together over time as you hear this but this is new and it's certainly not trivial so you might want to listen carefully.
Last week we filed with the NRC a supplement to the Indian Point license renewal application related to the state of New York's requirement or Coastal Zone Management consistency determination under the federal Coastal Zone Management Act or CZMA.
The supplement states that federal regulations make clear given previous reviews of the Indian Point facilities there is no need for a further states CZM review and as a result the NRC may issue the requested Indian Point renewed operating licenses without the need for an additional consistency review.
And let me amplify that point.
Hang on just a second.
Sorry I've lost  about 10 pages of my script here.
So let me amplify that point.
The preamble to the federal regulations implementing the CZMA state: In the event the state agency has previously reviewed a license or permit activity further review is limited to cases where the activity will be modified substantially causing new coastal zone effects.
Exception does not apply in the case of Indian Point since no change in operations has proposed for purposes of license renewal.
Prior CZMA consistency reviews were done for units 3 and unit 2 in 2000 and 2001 respectively by the New York Power Authority and Con Ed transferred ownership for the plans to Entergy.
In both instances the state of New York determined that operation of the Indian Point facilities was consistent with the case state coastal zone management plan.
Based upon these and other prior reviews and the fact that it's part of the license renewal proceedings Indian Point's continued operations will not be substantially different than when the prior reviews were conducted.
We do not believe CZMA requires Indian Point to obtain another consistency review from the state of New York in connection with its license renewal applications.
To that end yesterday we filed with the ASLB a motion for declaratory order agreeing with our position.
Responses by parties including the State of New York to our ASLB motion are due within 10 days although extensions are possible.
We expect that once the parties have stated their positions the ASLB will set a process resolve the issue and issue a decision.
ASLB decisions are appealable to the commissioners but it's not appealed the decisions are filed.
In summary we've made clear our position supported by the expert opinion regarding the law and the consistency of prior reviews conducted at Indian Point that there is no basis to require  a CZM determination as part of the license renewal process.
How and when the processes will advance from here will be determined by the ASLB.
It's important to keep in mind under federal regulations the NRC is the ultimate decision-maker and when the changes have been made they'll want additional review.
As a reminder the federal law also states as national policy the preference for continuing to use already developed areas again like Indian Point facilities into developing new greenfield areas within coastal zones.
And furthermore New York state's federally-approved coastal management program sites location of nuclear facilities in the coastal zone including the Indian Point as demonstrating the state's recognition of the national interest of Entergy facilities.
Regarding that last point there is a good reason why Entergy point serves the national interest.
Indian Point is safe secure and vital.
It's the only plant in the country that voluntarily submit to an extensive blue-ribbon panel audit which we passed with flying colors in 2008.
The preclusion of the  panel of experts was unequivocal.
Indian Point is a safe plant.
Before closing I want to highlight a few recent awards recognized and the operational strengths of our organization.
In a report issued by J.
D.
Powers and Associates earlier this month all of Entergy's Utility operating companies showed gains in the 2012 electric utility residential customer satisfaction study.
In fact Entergy  New Orleans was named the most improved Utility company.
This contrast to the results overall where the national customer satisfaction index declined by 3 points the second consecutive year of decline.
The key factor for the industry of course was the negative impact on perception of power quality and reliability due in part to severe storms that affected several parts of the country.
In May nuclear operations once again received Top Industry Practice Awards from Nuclear Energy Institute for innovative improvements in cost and safety practices at Pilgrim and Arkansas Nuclear One.
This is the 10th consecutive year we received nuclear honors in the NEI Tips Award program.
And finally I'm pleased to report that once again Entergy scored a perfect 10.0 global ratings from GovernanceMetrics International in July 2012 for best-in-class corporate governance.
Entergy has maintained its rating in each of the quarterly periods since 2006 with the exception of one small dip in early 2011 establishing stringent corporate governance standards and living up to them every day and everything we do is an absolute necessity to us and to maintain the trust that you have placed in us.
We demanded of ourselves and I can assure the Board of Directors demands it not only of us but of themselves as well.
And now I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Thank you Wayne and good morning everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover second quarter 2012 financial results our cash performance for the quarter and then add a few closing remarks.
Starting with our financial results on Slide 2 higher overall second quarter 2012 earnings were driven by higher results at both the Utility and EWC compared to a year ago and lower results at Parent &amp; Other.
Second quarter earnings included a special item for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed spin-off and merger of Entergy's transmission business with ITC Holdings.
Spending on our spin-merge initiative reduced the quarter's earnings per share by $0.05 at Utility.
Now let's turn to operational results for the quarter.
Slide 3 summarizes the major drivers for operational earnings.
Utility results were higher than a year ago due primarily to reduction in income tax expense.
This was partially offset by lower net revenue and higher nonfuel operation and maintenance expenses.
An agreement with the IRS regarding the storm cost financings in Louisiana for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reduced income tax expense by $180 million for the affected companies Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.
The company has also recorded regulatory charges totaling $101 million after tax to reflect an agreement to share the tax benefits with Louisiana customers.
The net effect of these items increased Utility earnings by $0.44 per share.
Excluding the regulatory charge Utility net revenue was modestly higher this quarter compared to a year ago.
The increase was due largely to positive weather-adjusted sales growth.
After excluding the effects of weather billed retail sales increased 4%.
The Entergy region benefited from a reasonably healthy economy.
Industrial sales continued to grow from expansions.
However overall weather-adjusted sales growth through the second quarter is roughly consistent with what we expected.
While the effect of weather was positive for the quarter it was lower than the significantly warmer-than-normal temperatures last year.
On a year-to-date basis the weather effect was negative and well below last year.
Higher nonfuel operation in maintenance expense partially offset the earnings increase.
O&amp;M for the quarter reflected higher compensation and benefits costs driven primarily by pension expense.
Fossil and distribution spending also increased over last year due in part to increased fossil outage spending with timing differences also contributing to both.
Slide 4 summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for the second quarters of the current and previous years.
The quarter-over-quarter decline was due primarily to lower net revenue and increased nonfuel operation and maintenance expense.
EWC's net revenue reflected lower energy pricing towards nuclear fleet.
Nuclear generation also declined as a result of additional refueling and unplanned outage days.
Lower production was offset by the exercise of resupply options under power purchase contracts.
The nonnuclear portfolio partially offset lower net revenue from EWC's nuclear fleet.
The RISEC plant acquired last December was the driving factor.
Higher nonfuel operation and maintenance expense also contributed to the decrease in operational adjusted EBITDA.
The increase was due primarily to higher compensation in benefits costs again primarily pensions.
The RISEC acquisition also contributed to higher nonfuel O&amp;M.
While EWC's operational adjusted  EBITDA declined its earnings increased quarter-over-quarter.
The increase was due primarily to 2 items not included in adjusted EBITDA: Lower decommissioning expense and the lower effective income tax rate.
Operational results at the Parent &amp; Other disclosure segment declined due primarily to higher income tax expenses on Parent &amp; Other activities.
The income tax expense increase reflected the net effect of favorable tax items recorded in both quarters the 2011 effect exceeded the current quarter.
Slide 5 provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the quarter.
Operating cash flow for the current quarter was $587 million or $67 million lower than the same quarter last year.
The decrease was due to lower net revenue at EWC and the regulatory refund to a wholesale customer at the Utility.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 earnings guidance which ranges from $3.49 to $4.29 per share on an as-reported basis and $4.85 to $5.65 per share on an operational basis.
The as-reported earnings guidance range was updated to include specials recorded in the current quarter.
The as-reported guidance does not reflect any potential future expenses for the special item in connection with the proposed spin-merge of Entergy's transmission business.
As-reported earnings guidance will be updated to reflect the special item as actual costs incurred throughout 2012.
On our last earnings call we identified several challenges that had developed during the first quarter.
At that time we also had other significant uncertainties such as the pending appeal of the foreign tax credit decision.
While we still have our biggest quarter to go as we sit here today we are well positioned relative to our full year guidance range.
Current indications point to the higher end of the range.
As we head into the second half of the year we remain focused on continuing to produce positive financial results as well as strong operational performance.
And we remain focused beyond 2012 as well.
As we look ahead to 2013 I want to offer some initial thoughts.
Turning to Slide 7.
At the Utility we work to get the right regulatory constructs in place to provide every jurisdiction the opportunity to earn its allowed return.
One example is the Texas rate case that Wayne discussed earlier which will have a bearing on 2013 and beyond.
We also have other upcoming rate cases.
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will file rate cases in January of next year.
Entergy Arkansas is also expected to have a rate case tied to its exit from the System Agreement at year end.
All are likely to take most of next year to complete.
Further the timing and execution of our investment program will affect results.
At EWC one of the most significant variables is the price of power both Entergy and capacity.
Commodity markets continue to challenge margins.
However fundamental indicators in the natural gas market such as narrowing storage surpluses falling rig counts and low liquids margins appear to be signaling that we're moving off of a bottom and into a more constructive territory.
The appendix to this webcast presentation include the details on the current state of the market for energy and capacity prices for EWC.
Protecting the long-term value of our nuclear asset is a key priority.
That includes managing the license renewal process for Indian Point -- for the Indian Point units as well as defending the license renewals already received from the NRC.
In the meantime we're utilizing hedging strategies to protect near-term value while retaining longer-term options.
For both businesses managing cost remains at the forefront.
However as we've seen this year some things like pension expense are driven by external factors we don't control.
Efforts are underway to determine opportunities to mitigate cost pressures now and over the long term.
At the Parent we're always looking for opportunities to improve business results.
For example last week we received authorization to execute a $500 million commercial paper program at the Parent.
The CP program will provide a cost-effective source of capital as well as incremental financial flexibility.
At current rates borrowing from  the commercial paper market will be about 100 basis points below the rate on the revolver which will provide interest savings and bottom line earnings.
We are now finalizing plans to implement this program in the third quarter assuming market conditions stay favorable.
Every day we focus on safety operational excellence risk management and disciplined capital deployment.
Whether managing the current year or planning ahead the goal is to deliver results that will create tangible long-term value for our stakeholders.
And now the Entergy team is available for your questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> I guess on the last earnings call Wayne you brought up the concept of looking at strategic options for the unregulated generation business.
Could you just update us on any thought process there? Well I'll let -- Leo and his team has been working on this.
But I think one of the things that we kind of emphasize that given the uncertainty in a lot of these marketplaces and the environmental regulations and other types of things that we almost have to go back -- one of the additional things we're doing is going back to when we tried to form an axis.
And our opinion at the time of course it was -- these businesses don't belong together for a number of reasons.
They're financed differently.
They have different credit metrics things of that nature.
But then as power prices have fallen and things of that nature and credit metrics and credit quality become a real issue for this on a stand-alone basis as it's structured for the wholesale business.
and -- but nonetheless we still believe it should be separated from the utility.
So one of the other options is to look at transactions or assets or whatever that impact positively credit quality so we can get back to maybe at the notion of separating the 2 businesses rather than focus just on a functional adding power maybe at something else.
I'll let  Leo to have expand on his thoughts on the idea.
Yes Steve the bottom line is if you go all the way back to the kinds of things we would have been looking at the time we came up with the separation concept a lot of those ideas haven't gone away.
As we've always looked at that portfolio ways to grow the business ways to protect the business way to enhance the credit quality of the business ways to provide liquidity of the business we continue to look at all of those kinds of opportunities whether they involve internal moves or transactions-based ideas and really could run the gambit of ways to improve the credit quality improve the margins improve the valuation and to make sure that we continue to protect not only the parent company but  the Utilities as well.
Research Division</strong> Okay one other question.
Just Leo thank you for giving some of those 2013 drivers and beyond.
Is there just maybe kind of a punchline of what you're trying to highlight with -- these seem generally the stuff that we normally kind of you've highlighted in the past.
Was there any -- is it mainly these rate cases that...
Well you're really Steve just to give you all an indication of what's going to drive 2013 and beyond and the timing of when those things actually show up during the year as much as anything else.
And we'll hear next from Dan Eggers of Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> I just wondered if we could go back to the kind of the MISO conversation and the ITC transaction.
If you think about timing and then kind of perpetual delays to get in the filings done for ITC is there something structurally you're seeing that is slowing down that process and what is the level of confidence we'll see filing get done in the third quarter? Theo Bunting  is really heading that process up as the CEO of our Utility.
But Dan I don't think there's anything structurally that's holding it up.
Our commitment is to put on the strongest possible case in an area that is kind of new to a lot of the parties to the case and we want to make sure that we fully support and emphasize how important this is.
We're bringing together 2 companies Entergy and ITC along with a number of outside experts who believe very strongly and have evidence to support why the independent model is so much better than how we're doing it today.
And just bringing all the different points of view and testimony together it's clearly everybody's on the same page and it's clearly there's a -- to the commission and other intervenors on the case has been a little more challenging probably than we might have expected.
We thought that we would be able to make our first filing in Louisiana near the end of this month.
We gave ourselves kind of another week to button everything up and we're just not quite there yet.
Now Leo and Theo are having meetings this week to try to resolve any issues that we feel like are not supported as well as we want.
To get that analysis and the testimony to -- typically the way we would do it or ITC would do it when you just do it on your own.
So it's nothing structural it's just complicated when you involve more parties and we want to get it right.
Theo anything to add or...
Yes I would like to add something Dan let me -- I agree with a lot of -- all of the things Wayne said.
The other thing I think you need to consider is we're doing this in multiple jurisdictions and we're trying to do this on a manner that would allow us to make those filings in those jurisdictions with not much passage of time between filings.
So obviously we have to think about how do we ensure we incorporate all of items need to consider relative to those jurisdictions so that when we start that process we don't get any significant slowdown.
I do think as Wayne said there's still some things we need to work through.
We'll be working through those things over the next few weeks and we'll begin that filing process.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And I guess just Leo on the tax issues for the year is there anything else we should be looking at that you could provide a benefit for this year? And did you anticipate this level of benefits showing up in the guidance when you guys updated this spring? Well we updated the guidance this year obviously.
We had the possibility of both positive and negative items in the tax arena.
We knew we were working obviously on the settlement but at the same point in time we had the appeal of the foreign tax credit decision which had already been lost in a different jurisdiction at a different district for which we had provided the reserve last year.
So that could have been the positive that you saw this quarter because of the win.
But if we had lost that case it was a significantly larger negative possibility.
So we had indications around both of those things but they were unknown at the time and could have gone either direction.
There's always a few things in the hopper as you know based on the size and number of the positions that we've got in front of us at the moment that may or may not turn out may or may not happen could go to litigation like the foreign tax credit case or could be settled.
It just depends on where we are on the audit cycle and what issues are available there.
We had taken some of that into consideration when we reset the guidance remember the $0.22.
I think we characterized that as other in the improvement.
In the original guidance some of that was taken into consideration tax items that may or may not occur.
I think we've mentioned that at the time.
We'll hear next from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> Focusing on Table 4 on Page 3.
Your weather-adjusted sales growth has been quite robust.
You make some comments in there about growth in -- industrial sales growth particularly in Louisiana.
You also had retail sales growth.
Can you extrapolate a on what's going on in terms of residential growth why that's so strong what types of industrial activity you're seeing that are leading to this type of growth? And then the decline in the refineries could we characterize that as seasonal because as I understand it they were down for maintenance and therefore that should be additive when they come back? It's really a very positive underlying theme here.
Okay Theo you want to take that? Sure.
Craig as Leo mentioned in his opening comments obviously on the residential -- let's start with the residential side first.
We are seeing some impacts from still a fairly strong economy in our region especially when you compare it to what's going on nationally.
Also I think you have to think about some of the things we had last year that didn't necessarily repeat themselves this year.
We had certain events last year that had a dampening effect on sales for instance the flooding we had from the Mississippi River that reduced sales volumes.
And also I think last year we had fairly extended periods of extreme weather high bills and generally customers respond to that.
So we probably had some amount of customer response relative to bills last year.
And also I think Leo mentioned the fact that our -- may have mentioned the fact that our billing cycles this year for the quarter had a few days beyond what we would have seen last year as well.
And all of those things really coupled together had some effect on the year-over-year change.
And if you back and if you look at the residential growth year-over-year last it was actually slightly negative.
So given that we saw a fairly robust change year-over-year.
But again as we have said earlier I think we still fundamentally feel like we're -- where we -- about where we expected to be at this point in time relative to sales.
In terms of industrials I think at the chemicals that continue to show fairly strongly in terms of segments in the second quarter and a lot of that is relative to facilities expansions.
As we go through the year we'd likely see some of that moderate as we're kind of seeing those expansions and when they hit in various points in times in prior years.
There are obviously we do get outages in certain areas in terms of customers bringing their facilities down for various reasons.
And that can move our industrial sales up and down as you compare period-to-period.
We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Research Division</strong> Just on the Texas rate case here just if things don't turn out as positively with the final reg here in August what are the various avenues? You've kind of alluded to them quickly on the opening statements but if we were to see a move towards a capacity-type rider when would that happen? Or alternatively if we weren't at what point down the line say 6 months a year from now do we see another filing just to be a little bit more explicit about the timeline? Theo? It sounded like you had a number of questions there Julien.
I'm trying to get though them.
Yes I guess the first thing I would make sure we well understand is where we're at today is we basically have a kind of proposal for decision.
It's not an order from the commission.
And that's still forthcoming.
And part of that obviously what we would do relative to that would have a lot to do with what comes out of that commission order.
I would say it's not unusual in Texas for the commission to not accept all aspects of a PFD.
And as Wayne talked about earlier in terms of various riders that are in place today in the current rate construct in Texas obviously those will be opportunities for us given once we know the outcome of the case itself.
And obviously to talk about what we might do and whom we might do it at this point in time is probably a little premature because we don't have the outcome of the case yet.
The capacity rider it's in a rule-making phase and we are working and we'll continue to work to move that along.
Also as Wayne mentioned in his opening script the big part of what's the issue in the case as it relates to the recommendation of ALJ is capacity.
And if in fact just assuming for a second that we don't fundamentally give what we believe is appropriate treatment relative to that and we would obviously like to -- and try to ensure that we move that rule-making along in order to get proper alignment of the regulatory construct in Texas with what we fundamentally believe is appropriate and what's taking place there.
Yes I think like Theo said we need to get the order out of the commission.
Hopefully it will undo some of these what we think are inappropriate adjustments.
But it won't only just be for the outcome it will be tone set in the order.
Hopefully it will give us some guidance that will be instructive at which way to best to proceed.
And obviously we want -- we don't want to start a war with the commission by going one way if they would prefer another.
We're hopeful that they will acknowledge that this does not give us the opportunity to earn a fair return and they will fix that or give us a strong guidance on how to fix that ourselves.
We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Greg asked my question on sales growth.
I was wondering though on the -- one of the commissioners in Louisiana is talking about changing the ROE kind of significantly on the downward side.
And I was wondering if you could sort of elaborate if he's being joined by anybody else or if he's kind of an outlier on that and any thoughts you have on that.
I'll let -- Theo is maybe closer to it.
But as you know in this interest rate environment I suspect there isn't a commission on the country -- you don't have at least one commissioner who's bringing the issue up as it appropriate.
It's a good question.
Obviously interest rates are much lower than we're used to and the -- in like Louisiana specifically we really have not heard a lot on the issue we do have one commissioner who more outspoken on it.
But again it's fairly [indiscernible] I think across the country.
But Theo why don't you...
Yes I think also one thing that you will note in Louisiana.
I mean that issue has come before the commission at least on maybe one couple of occasions and they just not moved it along.
And as Wayne said I think we have one commissioner there who is very interested and looking into this.
But I think you also have to consider and I think they have to consider interest rates is really just one input into that the entire process of defining what's an  appropriate ROE.
You also have to think about risk premiums and you also have to think about the fact that there's a  legal standard around what is the appropriate ROE.
And ROE basically should be set such that you can maintain the financial integrity of the company you can raise capital on a reasonable term such that the Utility can discharge its public duty relative to the customers.
And in this period of time we're seeing fairly extensive capital investment across the Utility industry.
And I think regulators really need to think about and consider all of these elements as you think about what is the appropriate ROE for Utility.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And then on the stock buyback repurchases any thoughts to sort of -- at this point in time I know you got a lot of things going on a lot of initiatives.
Obviously the ITC stuff and everything else.
How should we think about your thoughts about stock repurchases given everything that you're looking at and what have you? Leo? Well obviously we haven't -- we didn't have any stock repurchases in the quarter.
We've completed $150 million of the $500 million of authority that we have at the moment so it's $350 million less.
Just philosophically the way the repurchase program works is based on the results out of EWC and/or any kind of transactional-based results that we have for example if we sold an asset or what have you.
The dividends usually paid for by the Utility so that's the construct around it.
And depending on what capital expenditures are the cash flow may or may not be used for that.
So for example at the end of last year when we acquired the RISEC plant we spent over $300 million on that plant.
That part of what goes into the decision-making process around the repurchase.
So I guess at the moment we haven't done any recently we typically don't signal what we are going to do but just philosophically to know that transactions and/or EWC non-utility earnings that's where the buyback money comes from.
We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> You've been making progress at the state level and in moving towards membership in MISO.
And in the filings obviously comes up the discussion of distinguishing between MISO membership and approving the ITC sale.
Can you talk about just general a feedback that you've been receiving at the state level to the ITC sale element relative to MISO.
appreciating that that's a later element.
But just nonetheless just any color on the feedback you received at the state level? Theo do you want to in detail? Yes.
Stephen I'm not sure I was -- the audible level of your -- it's fairly low.
Let me see if I can repeat your question on which you were asking.
Were you asking us to in the MISO proceedings are we getting questions around the ITC sale and/or -- just want to make sure I understand what your question was.
Research Division</strong> Yes I think my focus really was just in your conversations about the overall ITC transaction at the state level which I understand we will come up as part of the MISO proceedings.
Can you just talk generally to the feedback that you've been receiving at the state level relating to the ITC transaction? Yes and I made a huge mistake.
I said sales it's not a sale.
It's just been merged.
And I hope I don't think I used that term in my testimony that I plan to file.
But in any case It does come up from time to time but we try to make sure folks understand that they are separate processes they're separate transactions they're separate steps.
Obviously we need to get to MISO to an RTO in order to effectuate the ITC transaction.
And as we've said to many regulators I mean we are focused on getting  in MISO and getting to an RTO.
And that's part of the reason I think why you've seen some passage of time and some separation as it relates to the filings around the ITC transaction is that we are -- we're trying to work through within the various jurisdictions that MISO process.
And moved the various commissions along and other parties to get through that MISO process and get on MISO approvals but it does come up from time to time.
Yes I think the discussions I had been involved in I think it's actually been very encouraging.
The regulators have been very interested in trying to understand more.
When we proposed a similar -- actually I guess it wasn't all that similar 2 years ago it was hostile environment with regard to some type of divestiture of the transition system.
They have -- the questions we've gotten had been very much on point with regard to how things will change.
The overall feeling seems to be that they -- given the amount of merchant capacity we have in our territory given some of the feedback that they've gotten from some of the merchants and some of the extensive audits and -- that we've had relative to merchants some of the merchant's concerns and other concerns they understand that this needs some sort of resolution other than continuing to try to just regulate this thing to debt.
Separating it resolves all those issues and eliminates this -- any perception along with it solves a lot of problems for Entergy with regard to credit quality and  that just lowers rates for customers and assures reliability.
And we've had really good dialogue I think with the commissions.
And the big concern -- the biggest concern that I've heard is to try to explain exactly how giving that jurisdiction the FERC would have ultimate authority on how they maintain authority to execute their job assuring reliability at a fair price and all those type of things and they don't want to end up just as another intervenor at FERC.
And so that's kind of I think had been working through the process trying to make sure that that doesn't happen.
That's really the issue with them but again it's been very constructive.
And our final question comes from Mike Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> I just want to make sure I'm following the rate changes you expect between now and maybe the year end of 2013 kind of following on some of Leo's comments.
You discussed the Texas rate case.
I guess the question is do you think you would file another case and have new rates in place before year-end '13? Then the Louisiana formula rate plane adjustments that are outlined in the appendices do you expect the incremental adjustments before the actual Louisiana rating changes or rate cases kind of resolve? And then the timing of an Arkansas case how early would you file when do you think rates would go into effect there? And apologies a fourth item how do we think about how Grand Gulf's operate will impact rates? I think Theo is getting a good introduction here to his new job but he's like we've said before he's certainly up to the challenge and probably the most knowledgeable person we've ever had in this job so we'll let him prove it right now.
I think he's asking me to prove that because first he wants to make sure if I can actually remember all the questions.
I'll start maybe in reverse order.
Grand Gulf I don't think as you know Grand Gulf is FERC regulated and there is a specific tariff around how cost through the unit power purchase agreement of SERI and the various operating companies how that cost flows from Grand Gulf or from  SERI to the operating companies.
And the various operating companies have different regulatory mechanisms in place to recover cost associated with those billings from SERI.
And they vary a little bit jurisdiction to jurisdiction but they all have fairly timely mechanisms in place to recover cost associated with Grand Gulf.
In terms of filings obviously we would expect the filing in Arkansas consistent with its departure from the system agreement.
And obviously that's targeted for the end of 2013.
Louisiana when you talked about FRPs Wayne talked a little bit about the FRP results as it related to our filings based on the 2011 test year I think as Leo mentioned we would be making rate case filings in Louisiana in January of 2013 to basically reset rates.
Depending upon the length of the proceeding it's potentially you could have some impact from that decision relative to that case in 2013.
But that will be a function of the procedural schedule that obviously we will get once we make those particular filings.
As it relates to one of the questions you had Mississippi we made our FRP filing no changes relative to that filing based again on 2011 test year.
And was there another jurisdiction that -- where there jurisdiction I missed? Research Division</strong> When would you -- if Texas rate case resolved in the next month or so when do you expect you would be back in filing for a new place rate increase? I mean it's pretty mature to talk about that at this point.
We don't have an order out of Texas.
And so until we get an order and realistically see where we are we'll evaluate that and make an assessment as to what is the appropriate time to file.
And at this time we have no further time for any other questions.
I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing or final remarks.
Thank you Deanna and thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statements.
Our call was recorded and can be accessed on our website or by dialing (719) 457-0820 replay code 8666645.
The recording will be available as soon as practical after the transcript is filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission due to filing requirements associated with the proposed spin-off and merger of Entergy transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp.
The telephone replay will be available through August 7 2012.
This concludes our call.
Thank you.
Again this does conclude today's conference.
We thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call.
As a reminder today's call is being recorded.
At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations Paula Waters.
Please go ahead.
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Wayne Leonard; and then Leo Denault our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] As part of today's conference call Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
On September 25 2012 ITC Holdings Corp.
filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC registering shares of ITC common stock to be issued to Entergy shareholders in connection with the proposed spin-merge of our transmission business with ITC.
But this registration statement has not become effective.
In addition our subsidiary Mid South TransCo will file a registration statement with the SEC registering TransCo common units to be issued to Entergy shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions.
Entergy shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and the prospectus to be included in the TransCo registration statement and other relevant documents when available because they contain important information about ITC TransCo and the proposed transactions.
These documents when they are available can be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and can also be obtained free of charge upon written request to Entergy or ITC.
Now I'll turn the call over to Wayne.
Thanks Paula.
Good afternoon everyone.
We are relieved for all of you that we can be here today to talk to you now that Hurricane Sandy is gone and the restoration is well underway.
Entergy sent teams of more than 852 workers and support staff to assist in the restoration effort from Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi and Texas.
The first wave last Saturday October 27.
The second was requested and immediately assembled last Monday.
As you know we are well acquainted with major storms.
We also know that every storm has its own unique challenges.
That was the case for us this last -- past quarter when Hurricane Isaac made its way through our service territory in late August and last week for many of you.
For us it was a low-level hurricane 1 that just wouldn't leave.
It was unique in its lifespan limiting restoration and dumping 20 inches of water on many parts of our territory.
For many of you it was another unique low-level hurricane at the end of the storm season colliding with the onset of the winter storm season.
And more importantly it was unique in its massive size.
Both hurricanes remind us it's not the peak intensity of the hurricane that matters most but the amount of integrated kinetic energy or what they call IKE.
Because of its size Sandy now ranks #2 of all time on the IKE measure in its cumulative destructive power that the Northeast endured.
Actually it lands right ahead of Katrina and right behind Isabel in 2003.
Among other things storm surge correlates most highly with IKE not the Saffir-Simpson hurricane intensity scale.
Most all deaths from hurricanes result from storm surge.
Many in the country may not appreciate how a low-level hurricane can be so destructive.
But in Louisiana we certainly understand what you all experienced.
Today you're in the midst of what for some may be a long recovery effort particularly with the threat of another storm within the week.
Our thoughts and well wishes continue to be with each and every one of you in the storm's path as you begin that recovery.
With that in mind and the fact that the fall EEI conference is next week and you have a lot of companies to prepare for Leo and I will try to cover the waterfront today so your time can be used most efficiently this week and next.
That means more time for talk and probably less for questions today but we expect it will help to make our meetings next week be as focused as possible on what really matters to you relative to Entergy.
And the fact is we simply have a lot of aspirations for our stakeholders and goals and objectives necessary to achieve them and the activities around them never seem to slow down.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing.
In that regard we are very pleased to report to you substantial progress on one of those key initiatives that is projected to provide significant benefits to our customers and all stakeholders.
Of course I'm talking about the recent unanimous approvals in 2 retail jurisdictions on the proposed move to join the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator the Regional Transmission Organization by December 2013.
First on October 25 the Public Utility Commission of Texas voted unanimously to approve with conditions Entergy Texas' proposal to transfer operational control of its transmission facilities to MISO.
Then the next day the Arkansas Public Service Commission issued Order #72 giving its conditional approval to Entergy Arkansas' request to move to MISO also.
With these 2 orders in place plus the May conditional approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission we are well on our way towards a structure that will create up to $1.4 billion of projected customer savings across all Entergy's utilities jurisdictions.
To quickly recap events over the past 3 months.
In early August the Arkansas Commission issued Order #68 stating "While they previously found an RTO was in the public interest they were unable to reach a finding at that time nor did MISO was in the public interest." Consequently they set out 19 specific conditions necessary to reach that conclusion.
Most of the conditions Entergy Arkansas or MISO had already agreed to.
In response both Entergy Arkansas and MISO filed motions describing how they would meet those conditions.
And we are pleased that in the October 26 order the APSC found that Entergy Arkansas and MISO had in fact either complied or substantially complied with Order #68 conditions.
There was one exception relating to the MISO governance proposals intending to formalize current practice regarding transmission planning and to give state regulators more authority regarding transition cost allocation.
Specifically MISO must file proof that these proposals have been officially approved and adopted by the appropriate MISO entities.
Evidence of that was provided to the APSC last Wednesday.
The APSC can now issue its final conditional approval.
In Texas as I indicated earlier at the end of October the Public Utility Commission issued an order approving a nonunanimous settlement or NUS with certain modifications supporting Entergy Texas' move to MISO.
Parties to the NUS were: Entergy Texas and MISO the staff the industrial groups the cities and state agencies East Texas Electric Cooperative Southwestern Public Service Company and NRG.
No stakeholders expressed opposition except SPP.
In their proposal for decision on NUS the administrative law judges found that the settlement "represents an integrated resolution of all signatories' concerns." The PUCT's approval followed ETI and other parties' acceptance of proposed modifications to the NUS as discussed at the October 19 and October 25 open meetings.
The MISO change of control applications remain pending but not stalled in Mississippi and New Orleans.
In mid-September Entergy Mississippi reached a settlement with the Public Utilities Staff that supports Entergy Mississippi's proposal to join MISO.
Around the same time the South Mississippi Electric Power Association a co-owner of Grand Gulf Nuclear Station and a wholesale electric provider within Entergy Mississippi's footprint filed a testimony that they no longer oppose Entergy Mississippi's move to MISO subject to certain conditions.
In addition the Municipal Energy Agency of Mississippi Entergy Mississippi's largest wholesale customer filed a joint stipulation supporting change of control to MISO in mid-August.
No parties in Mississippi other than SPP are in opposition.
The Mississippi Public Service Commission is scheduled to issue a decision at the open meeting on November 15.
In New Orleans the October 23rd hearings were suspended to allow settlement discussions to proceed with the council's advisors which they have there.
Joining MISO marks a significant transformation of the Entergy system providing greater independence transparencies and efficiencies and providing substantial benefits for customers contributing to the ability to maintain affordable rates for Entergy's utility customers.
Joining MISO also addresses the upcoming exits of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi from the System Agreement to be followed by the exit of Entergy Texas envisioned by the terms of the PUCT's October 26 Order.
The Texas agreement on MISO requires a transition study regarding the determination of the impact of Entergy Texas leaving the Entergy System Agreement and the earliest feasible date to do so.
The target completion date for this study will be set to allow the PUCT sufficient time prior to a October 2013 deadline established by the order for Entergy Texas to give notice to exit the System Agreement.
Of course approval to join MISO or another acceptable RTO is one requirement to close the proposed spinoff and merger of the transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp.
We have now taken the next major steps in the ITC transaction a transaction that creates complete independence in all aspects of transmission service and ownership providing additional benefits to customers and other stakeholders.
Critical to creating and expanding regional markets for generation is not just establishing transparency and independence but the elimination of any perception of a conflict of interest.
Those steps include initiating the approval process in every jurisdiction except Texas and Missouri.
That is not a misstatement.
We do have a very small amount of transmission assets in Missouri and just recently were accepted as a public utility there.
At this point remaining filings are targeted by year end.
Given that the PUCT is required to issue an order within 100 days of filing Entergy Texas plans to monitor the other utility operating companies for further information on procedural schedules.
To that end procedural schedules have already been adopted by the City Council of New Orleans and the ALJs in Louisiana.
The procedural schedule in Louisiana supports a decision at the September 2013 business and executive meeting.
In New Orleans the procedural schedule provides for hearings in July 2013.
In September ITC began the shareholder approval process by filing its Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
ITC shareholder vote is anticipated in the first half of 2013.
Other transactional filings in the quarter include applications filed with FERC requesting certain approvals related to the transaction including approval for change of control over transmission assets and a request for private letter ruling with the Internal Revenue Service to confirm the tax-free nature of the transaction.
We continue to target closing in 2013.
Another topic on shareholders minds across the country is the allowed return on equity levels for the utilities given the low interest-rate environment particularly in our case since 3 utility operating companies will be in rate cases next year.
The appropriate level of allowed ROE is an issue in every rate case.
The risk premiums that is the difference between the risk free debt rate and the required equity returns are generally part of the various methodologies to set the ROE but that is only an input or a relative measure depending on methodology that's being used.
The litmus test is whether regulators have met a legal responsibility to provide utilities with an opportunity to earn a return on invested capital as adequate to maintain the utilities' credit ratings at a level that supports access to capital in really simple terms so that utilities can continue to make investments necessary to reliably serve customers now and in the future given the obligation to serve and the various service standards associated with those franchise agreements or otherwise imposed by law -- other laws.
Thus regulators must reflect those facts in setting the ROE consistent with the Supreme Court findings in both Hope and Bluefield cases which have been a foundation for ROE-setting for nearly 70 years.
Nobody is suggesting this should be or ever has been a guaranteed return.
But the actual opportunity to earn on invested capital must fall within the zone of reasonableness relative to meeting standards for attracting capital in competitive financial markets.
In most cases properly setting base-period revenues and costs includes fixed known and measurable changes for the period rates will be in effect.
That's just as important to meeting the law and to maintain access to capital and solid credit rating as the absolute allowed ROE level.
That is the main issue we have once again in Texas.
In September the Public Utility Commission of Texas issued its order on Entergy Texas' rate case essentially affirming the ALJ's proposal for a decision which failed to satisfy this most basic principle necessary to maintain the confidence of the market and the credit rating agencies.
The PUC decision resulted in a $27.7-million base rate increase and as stated 9.8% allowed ROE the lowest ROE ever given by the PUCT to a vertically integrated utility.
But as I said on the last earnings call Entergy Texas will not be able to actually earn even its historically low ROE due primarily to $30 million of purchase power capacity costs that were effectively disallowed not for prudency reasons.
But it's not meeting the fixed known and measurable tasks in the minds of the Administrative Law Judges and then supported by the commission.
Entergy Texas continues to review its options in light of this final order and recent denial of its recent request for rehearing including seeking relief through the courts.
Other options include simply preparing to file a new base rate case filing to implement the transmission rider for costs that were deemed not meeting the known and measurable standard requesting the recovery of purchase power capacity costs by a special provision in the fuel adjustment clause and pursuing a purchase power capacity rider by itself.
To that last point late last month the PUCT held a technical workshop to discuss the staff draft rule for a purchase power capacity rider.
We and other utilities raised some concerns on the draft rule regarding whether and how load growth should be taken into account and post exclusion of affiliate purchases and how non-purchase power embedded generation should be considered.
Still even as proposed in our current set of facts and needs the purchase power rider accrual would help to mitigate the regulatory lag issues we're experiencing on the capacity purchases.
A notice of the proposed rule could be published later this month.
Once published in the Texas register the PUCT would have up to 6 months to act on the proposed rule.
Adding to the discussion on ROE in August the Mississippi Public Service Commission opened inquiries regarding ROE to formulate methodology for Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company.
This inquiry is limited to process not setting ROE levels.
EMI has a robust process already.
The allowed ROE bandwidth for Entergy Mississippi changes annually based on a formula tied to relative and absolute interest rates at year end and then performance adjustments for price reliability and customer satisfaction.
Also noteworthy is that Entergy Mississippi's formula rate plan including the ROE methodology was last thoroughly reviewed in 2010.
The Public Utilities Staff and consultants report is expected by year end.
This will be a comprehensive process where EMI will be afforded the opportunity to provide input and respond to other viewpoints as well.
A discussion of the quarter would not be complete without applauding the substantial efforts of our employees and mutual systems partners who traveled a combined total of 5 million miles to restore power in our service territory following the Hurricane Isaac.
Experts' early predictions for the 2012 would be a relatively tame hurricane season.
While there were no major hurricanes those 3 and above that actually hit U.S.
land mother nature still threw us a couple of curve balls that we have seldom seen before.
For us it was Hurricane Isaac the guest that wouldn't leave who struck the Gulf Coast in August.
And for many of you it was a very unlikely Sandy which showed up after closing time and was massive in its size for any time in the year.
While Isaac was deemed only a Cat 1 storm its slow-moving sustained high winds and rainfall and storm surge created havoc across our service territory especially in Southern Louisiana dumping over 20 inches of rain in many areas that are already low-lying where 20 inches can become 5 to 10 feet very fast.
The combined outage peak for each utility company was more than 787 000 customers making it the fourth-largest storm in company history.
This was my 18th major storm since coming to Entergy.
Each time I'm always amazed not only by the dedication of our people to return power to customers as safely and quickly as possible in the toughest of conditions but the desire and ability to continuously improve.
While we recognize the hardships many of our customers endured going days without power the fact is that Isaac restoration was faster than other storms with a similar number of outages.
Far and away the hardest hit area in the entire system were parishes in Southern Louisiana.
And the 8 parish presidents in Lafourche Plaquemines St.
Bernard and St.
Charles St.
John the Baptist St.
Tammany Tangipahoa and Terrebonne have been extremely complimentary of Entergy.
These people understand storms.
They have been flooded out despite massive earthen levies supplemented with extensive sandbags.
They've seen massive trees that look like they would stand forever broken and fallen right before their eyes.
In a public letter to the company 2 weeks ago they affirmed their complete support for what we do and how we do it both in the good times and the tough conditions we often have in severe weather events and their gratitude for being served by an Entergy utility.
In fact a Department of Energy expert who was on site gave Entergy an A+ calling it an unbelievable performance compared to what they had seen elsewhere and would expect in such conditions.
Some of our elected officials found DOE's assessment suspect and opened inquiries into what took so long.
For the record once winds subsided sufficiently to permit safe restoration 90% of the customers were restored in 4 to 5 days.
And as for the top priority in any storm or any day on the job for that matter we had no fatalities and only one lost-time accident during the restoration.
One of course is one too many but all in all a safe effort to the credit of our 10 000 boots on the ground and many others.
There will be lessons learned and we'll work individually and cooperatively with our retail regulators to identify and implement them.
At the LPSC's October 24 business and executive meeting the Louisiana utility operating companies believed they fully addressed the questions resulting from the recent "LPSC Electric Utility Hurricane Isaac inquiry" and planned to make their formal storm filing in 2013.
Also Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana have committed to participate in a future rule-making process to be sponsored by the LPSC with participation by all Louisiana electric utilities and a focus on potential improvements in storm restoration processes and procedures.
In regard to the inquiry in New Orleans Entergy New Orleans will file a report by early 2013 regarding Isaac restoration efforts.
And we will continue to work with the City Council and its advisers to address their questions as we did at the LPSC.
At Entergy Wholesale Commodities overall operationally the fleet continues to perform well.
We also continued to further key efforts for license renewals on our nuclear fleet.
Three weeks ago Phase 1 hearings began before the 3-panel judge of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board on 9 contentions at Indian Point.
Prior to the hearing a settlement was reached on one contention with Riverkeeper and Clearwater related to the NRC's assessment of groundwater quality at and around the site.
Hearings will continue until December followed by rulings by the ASLB on each contention.
Based on past precedents we expect this process to take at least 1 year to complete.
Additional hearings [indiscernible] were slated [ph] in Phase 2 on at least 4 other contentions.
There had been more than 150 contentions filed so far and 21 have been accepted for hearings to consolidate it into 16 issues.
Of those 16 3 have been settled or otherwise resolved.
Based on the media and questions we received from many of you at times we feel it's important to keep the law front and center.
Through all the license renewal-related legal and regulatory proceedings in Indian Point only the NRC has the authority to shut down the plant.
Indian Point is a safe plant.
It was confirmed by a blue-ribbon panel of independent experts in a 2008 review.
It's also a vital plant in New York as confirmed by numerous independent studies.
In fact 3 more independent reports were assessed -- released just this past quarter confirming the valuable benefits to the community at large.
First at a mid-September Manhattan Institute event a report was released by noted economist Jonathan Lesser finding that closure of Indian Point would lead to a $1.5-million to $2.2-billion annual increase in electric cost between 2016 and 2030 26 000 to 40 000 jobs lost annually and would cause the New York ISO to violate its own standard for reliability and lead to rolling blackouts.
The total net economic impact from the loss of Indian Point was pegged at $1.8 billion to $2.7 billion every year.
And I don't care if you live in Louisiana Mississippi Arkansas or New York; that's a big number.
The report concluded by stating all alternatives for replacing IPEC are limited and costly and all will result in higher electric rates for everyone in New York.
Another report issued in September by the Business Council of Westchester and the Westchester Business Alliance also was confirmed and supportive of Indian Point's continued operation.
Mayor Bloomberg has been active in securing independent studies to get to the truth on the importance of Indian Point to New York City.
For example the mayor's 2011 long-term plan report known as PlaNYC discusses both the reliability and pollution effects that would result if Indian Point were closed.
Additional pollution could have serious health consequences for the city's residents.
Those consequences include for example death from lung diseases or chronic breathing problems like asthma.
The critical summary of these studies is Indian Point's importance not only applies to the system reliability but to human health and harmful air emissions avoided by the plant's continued operations.
Just last week Mayor Bloomberg came out with what may be the first firm voice of the political season on the need to deal with carbon emissions.
Every year Indian Point avoids nearly 14 million tons of CO2 emissions as well as other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide compared to any likely replacement scenario.
I know you've heard and read many other opinions but as to grid reliability the New York ISO is the expert.
The 2012 Reliability Needs Assessment published in September confirmed reliability concerns highlighted in all the other reports you've seen.
As in the past RNAs the report found that reliability violations would occur immediately in the base case conditions if both Indian Point units retired at the end of 2015.
Many of you are following closely Governor Cuomo's Energy Highway Task Force as well.
Recently the energy task force issued a document entitled "New York Energy Highway Blueprint".
It is the product of their review of the 103 proposals submitted earlier this summer in response to an Energy Highway request for information.
The report acknowledges the criticality of Indian Point saying "The acute nature of the expected system impact should Indian Point not be relicensed requires the reliability contingency plan to be developed on an expedited implementation schedule." While the report makes no assumption around the probability of a closure of Indian Point it states "the contingency plan should acknowledge the need to meet an aggressive timeline in the event of retirement " and include suggestions for opportunities to improve current regulatory process to accelerate the development schedule.
At the same time the report notes the economic need as it called for "halting mechanisms" to any contingency plans in order to avoid unnecessary costs in the event Indian Point remains in operation.
We understand their anxiety over closure but don't necessarily share whatever odds they put on that outcome.
Entergy along with numerous independent experts believe it is virtually impossible to replicate the economic environmental and reliability benefits provided by Indian Point even in the long run.
Public polling also continues to show a strong majority support or do not oppose Indian Point's continued operation.
And it's not just our polls.
Just recently Newsday published a Siena College poll that they commissioned of Westchester and Rockland County residents' reaction to local issues.
On the question "Are you in favor of closing the Indian Point Energy Center or you do prefer it remain in operation " 57% said they preferred to keep the facility open 9% had no opinion and only 3% -- 33% favored shutting it down.
And that is in spite of a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation in the wake of Fukushima.
While we strive for constructive relationships in the communities we operate this is not decided by popular vote.
If it were you could call this contest right now.
But it comes down to one basic issue: in the opinion of federal experts is Indian Point safe to operate another 20 years? We believe it is undeniable and the facts will support that.
Turning to Vermont Yankee.
In 2012 the state of Vermont experienced 2 setbacks in federal court on their efforts to close Vermont Yankee.
In January the U.S.
District Court for the district court of Vermont issued a ruling invalidating state laws regarding license renewal and barring the state from acquiring a below-market power purchase agreement for continued operation.
But in June the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the state's appeal of the NRC's license issuance because they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and supported the NRC.
An appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals of the January district court decision remains pending along with Vermont Yankee's amended petition for a certificate of public good that's before the Vermont Public Service Board now.
Before closing I'm pleased to report Entergy was once again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and to the North American Index.
Entergy earned top scores in 5 areas reflecting excellence across all 3 dimensions of the scorecard: economic environmental and social.
This is the 11th consecutive year the Dow Jones Sustainability Index has included Entergy in either the World or the North American index or both.
In addition Entergy was included in the 2012 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index for the eighth time in the past 9 years.
As I said at the opening this is my last earnings call.
Leo Denault will assume the role of Chairman and CEO on February 1.
Having worked with Leo for almost 25 years I have no doubt he is the right choice.
My personal opinion is he steps into the position already as the best CEO in the industry.
He is just that good and I've been around all of them.
He has the knowledge and the experience.
He steps in with fresh legs and fresh ideas.
Over the last of couple of years we've made many management changes to ensure the next CEO would have the strongest team ever assembled at Entergy.
A team that has worked together many times on various issues and projects.
A team ready to address today's challenges complete initiatives underway as well as identify and execute on new ideas and opportunities to create sustainable value for all of you.
One of those individuals is Drew Marsh.
Drew will replace Leo as CFO.
He is extremely well versed in all aspects of our business and has been the go-to guy on tough assignments for some time.
At EEI next week you'll have a chance to meet Drew as well as Bill Mohl the incoming President at EWC who will replace Rick Smith when he retires January 31 also.
Through his long career Rick's leadership and dedication has been invaluable not only to you but certainly to me personally.
But we are extremely pleased that someone of Bill Mohl's caliber and extensive experience in natural gas and energy markets combined with hands-on experience in the regulatory arena will be leading EWC going forward.
I know you will come to really appreciate what both Drew and Bill bring to the management team just as you have in our decision to fast track Rod West over the last couple of years.
We will have an unusually large contingent at EEI this year as the result of a well-timed and thoroughly designed succession plan for a seamless transition by a very active Board of Directors who takes corporate governance for the priority it is and should be in this day and age.
We look forward to seeing all of you there.
And now I will turn the call over to Leo.
Leo? Thank you Wayne and good morning -- or afternoon everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover third quarter 2012 financial results cash performance for the quarter and earnings guidance and other forward looking financial updates.
Starting with our financial results on Slide 2.
Third quarter earnings were lower than a year ago.
Third quarter as-reported earnings included a special item for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed spinoff and merger of Entergy's transmission business with ITC Holdings.
Spending on our spin-merge initiative reduced the quarter's earnings per share by $0.06 at the utility.
Now let's turn to operational results for the quarter.
Slide 3 summarizes the major drivers for operational earnings.
Utility results were lower than a year ago due primarily to higher income tax expense higher non-fuel O&amp;M and higher depreciation expense which were partially offset by higher net revenue.
Income tax expense was higher due primarily to the absence of the IRS settlement obtained in the third quarter of last year which significantly reduced income tax expense in 2011.
The reduction in income tax expense was partially offset by a reduction in net revenue or the regulatory charge recorded to reflect the agreement to share the tax benefit with Entergy Louisiana customers.
The net effect of these 2 items quarter-over-quarter was $0.93 per share.
Excluding the regulatory charge utility net revenue was slightly lower than last year.
The decrease was due to weather.
Weather in the current quarter was positive but significantly lower than the extreme weather we experienced in 2011.
Sales were also affected by power outages caused by Hurricane Isaac.
These decreases were largely offset by the net effect of regulatory actions in several jurisdictions and increased net revenue from weather-adjusted sales growth.
Although overall weather-adjusted sales growth was essentially flat net revenue increased due to growth in higher-margin residential and commercial segments.
The decline in industrial sales was partially due to a customer outage.
Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense also contributed to the earnings decline driven by several factors.
Last year O&amp;M included a deferral of previously expensed fossil plant outage costs at Entergy New Orleans.
The current quarter includes a temporary increase in Entergy Mississippi's storm reserve and higher costs related to Entergy Arkansas' energy efficiency program both of which are offset by net revenue as well as adjustments related to Entergy Texas' final rate order.
Compensation and benefits expense also increased due to higher pension expense.
Slide 4 summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for the third quarters of the current and previous years.
The quarter-over-quarter decline was due primarily to lower net revenue and increased non-fuel operation and maintenance expense.
Lower power prices continue to affect EWC's net revenue.
Nuclear generation also declined as a result of increased refueling and unplanned outage days.
Lower production was partially offset by the exercise of resupply options under power purchase contracts.
Additional net revenue from RISEC which was acquired last December partially offset the overall decrease.
Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense also contributed to the decrease in operational adjusted EBITDA.
The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs largely pension.
The RISEC acquisition also contributed to higher non-fuel O&amp;M.
EWC's earnings declined as well but to a lesser extent.
Two factors which offset the operational adjusted EBITDA decreases: a lower depreciation expense and a lower effective income tax rate.
In the third quarter of 2012 we received approximately $100 million in damages for Indian Point 2 as a result of the Department of Energy's failure to provide timely spent fuel storage.
Damages awarded in this case allowed for the reduction of approximately $23 million pretax of certain previously recorded expenses notably depreciation with the balance reducing property plant and equipment on the balance sheet.
The lower effective income tax rate was due primarily to an intercompany item and is offset at Parent &amp; Other.
Before we leave EWC I'd like to mention one item in our earnings release.
As you can see on Slide 5 we've modified the information provided in Table 7 now titled Entergy Wholesale Commodities Capacity and Generation.
For the EWC nuclear portfolio we've updated the pricing details to better reflect the products we use to manage price risk including fixed-price physical and financial sales and contracts with price variability depending on market conditions such as calls puts and collars.
As a result we now provide multiple price scenarios for the average price contracted at Entergy assuming all contracts are sold at a minimum price level contracts being priced using September 30 market prices and contracts priced assuming a $10-per-megawatt-hour move in market prices up and down.
In addition we changed the capacity and energy revenue section to reflect the expected total revenue on a per-megawatt-hour basis on the entire nuclear portfolio at quarter-end prices as well as a plus-or-minus $10-per-megawatt-hour market price sensitivity.
The changes to this table are intended to give you more insight into the price risk protection and revenue potential for EWC's nuclear fleet.
Slide 6 illustrates the nature of some of our hedging products whereby the potential for price variation is asymmetric with more upside opportunity than downside risk.
Now turning back to results.
Operational earnings at Parent &amp; Other declined due primarily to higher income tax expense at Parent &amp; Other activities.
The higher income tax expense was due largely to the intercompany item between Parent &amp; Other and EWC which I noted earlier.
Slide 7 recaps our cash performance for the quarter.
Operating cash flow for the current quarter was approximately $1 billion $121 million lower than the same quarter last year.
The decrease was driven by lower net revenue at EWC and noncapital costs for Hurricane Isaac restoration.
Our 2012 earnings guidance ranges from $3.44 to $4.24 per share on an as-reported basis and $4.85 to $5.65 per share on an operational basis.
The as-reported earnings guidance range was updated to include special items recorded in the current quarter and does not reflect potential future expenses for the proposed spin-merge of Entergy's transmission business.
Our practice is to maintain our guidance range unless we have a reason to believe actual results will fall outside of the range.
Although we are not changing our 2012 operational guidance range current indications continue to point to the upper end of the range.
For the past several years we have provided our forward-looking financial update immediately before EEI's fall financial conference.
However this year with almost a week before the start of the conference we felt that it may be helpful to give you a head start and include 2013 guidance the long-term financial outlook and the preliminary 3-year capital plan with this release.
Slide 8 summarizes the 2013 earnings guidance we are initiating today which ranges from $4.60 to $5.40 per share on an as-reported and operational basis.
Following the same practices as in 2012 the as-reported guidance does not reflect the potential future expenses for the special item in connection with the proposed spin-merge of Entergy's transmission business.
As-reported earnings guidance will be updated to reflect these special items as actual costs are incurred.
I won't go through the guidance table line by line but I do want to point out a few highlights.
Starting with 2012 the adjusted starting point is $5.55 which is in the upper end of our operational guidance range.
This is consistent with current indications of where the year will end up.
The starting points were also adjusted for each of the reporting segments to reflect our current expectations and to improve alignment of certain intercompany items which will reduce intercompany effects between EWC and Parent &amp; Other and do not affect consolidated results.
Now let's turn to Utility.
Utility's 2013 guidance midpoint is slightly higher than the revised starting point for 2012 and reflects completion of several large projects in mid to late 2012 specifically Grand Gulf's power upgrade and Waterford 3's steam generator replacement.
Guidance also assumes that Hinds and Hot Springs are in service for all of 2013.
Just a reminder with Department of Justice's review of the Hinds and Hot Springs transactions is ongoing.
Closing has been delayed while the DOJ continues its review.
We do not know when the DOJ will conclude its review or the extent to which its review of the transaction will be affected by the ongoing civil investigation of competitive issues of the utility operating companies.
However for guidance purposes we assumed these assets are in rate base for a full year.
Reasonable [ph] these major projects affect several line items in our guidance table.
Net revenue increases from placing these projects into rates and includes recovery of direct costs as well as a return on our investment.
Expense increases include non-fuel O&amp;M taxes other than income taxes and depreciation expense.
Other income is also affected as we no longer record AFUDC on construction projects once they are placed in service.
Utility net revenue assumptions also include other rate actions and the corresponding increases in other expenses such as Entergy Arkansas' energy efficiency rider and Entergy Mississippi's storm rider.
The Utility's 2013 guidance also reflects the absence of 2 significant items that were present in 2012.
In the second quarter the Utility recorded a benefit from an IRS agreement which reduced income tax expense and the associated agreement to share those benefits with customers in Louisiana which reduced net revenue.
The net effect was a $0.44 earnings per share benefit in 2012.
The Utility recorded an increase in income tax expense in the first quarter of 2012 associated with the write-off of an Entergy Gulf States Louisiana regulatory asset which reduced 2012 earnings by $0.25 per share.
Turning to EWC.
The guidance midpoint reflects a decline in average energy prices year-over-year and assumes market prices as of September 30.
EWC's guidance also reflects the absence of 2 items included in 2012 results.
Second quarter results included an adjustment in the asset retirement obligation which reduced decommissioning expense by $0.16 per share.
As I noted earlier in the third quarter Indian Point received proceeds from the resolution of litigation related to the DOE's failure to provide timely spent fuel storage which reduced depreciation expense as well as non-fuel O&amp;M.
I'll also note the non-fuel O&amp;M increases includes higher costs for the RISEC facility for planned maintenance work.
There are also a few assumptions that apply to all businesses.
The consolidated 2013 guidance reflects an approximate 34% effective income tax rate in 2013 compared to a lower rate for 2012 which currently stands at 16% year-to-date on an as-reported basis.
The 2013 midpoint assumes a pension discount rate of 5.1% the same as for 2012.
Final pension expense for 2013 will be established based on interest rates market results and other assumptions that will not be available until early next year.
The release includes additional details on key assumptions as well as earnings sensitivities for 2013.
Slide 9 summarizes our updated long-term financial outlook; key changes; our Utility net income compound average growth of around 6% through 2014 off the 2009 base year; and capital deployment outlook to deploy around $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases from 2012 through 2014.
The updated outlook is within the range of previous estimates but as 2014 gets closer and we have a clear line of sight we provided more precise estimates to incorporate our current expectation of economic business and commodity market conditions.
I'd also like to note that our 2014 outlook is under our current structure.
We plan to update our long-term financial outlook once we have further clarity on the spin-merge of the transmission business so at the right time we'll provide an updated outlook that reflects what the businesses will look like after the spin-merge is resolved.
Finally we've also provided the preliminary 3-year 2013 through 2015 capital plan in Appendix E consistent with past practice.
As you can see on Slide 10 the preliminary plan totals $6.6 billion.
Next week we'll meet with many of you at the EEI conference.
At that time we'll talk about many topics including MISO ITC regulatory initiatives and issues cost management hedging strategy our view on commodity pricing and our point of view on other relevant issues.
We look forward to seeing you at EEI.
And now the Entergy team is available for your questions.
[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Wayne first of all congratulations on the retirement.
I know we'll see you at EEI but just publicly wanted to say that.
Okay thanks Dan.
Research Division</strong> When we look at the '13 guidance you guys provided I guess question number one is when you look at kind of the breadth of the band at this point in time the $0.80 given how much smaller the generation business is as a total percentage of the mix and how much you've hedged how -- where do you see the big variability points as you look at that number for next year? Based on what you guys have now and based on conditions to date do you think you're falling at the midpoint of that range or somewhere higher or lower than that? Well the big drivers are pretty consistent with what they've been in the past.
The big driver part of the range is what happens in -- from an EWC point of view with pricing.
And as you can see with the sensitivities associated with what we've got on Slide 6 or in Table 7 in the release there is some variability associated with price movements at EWC and that's really still the biggest driver that we see there.
In the Utility we do have some major rate actions as part of where we see them going forward.
So if you look at what happens with the Grand Gulf with Waterford 3 Hinds Hot Springs there is certainly significant amount of variability around those rate actions as well and as I mentioned and as we've seen in the past things like pension expense depending on where the discount rate is where the market performance is for the year those all have an impact.
So really there's I guess more variability in there Dan than you think based on some of those open items as it relates to pricing pension expense as well as those rate actions.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I know this year there's been a lot of weather variability year-to-year in the last couple of years.
The 1.5% growth or the normalized growth for next year at the Utilities how is that going to compare to the full year this year once you back out some of the unique weather events? Dan this is Theo.
I -- it's going to compare fairly close.
It will be probably -- I think our guidance for this year had a rate of about 1.6 or so.
And we're on track for that so it's going to compare fairly -- favorably fairly close to what we're seeing this year.
We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.
Research Division</strong> And Leo once again congratulations on the new role.
Wayne congratulations on moving on up.
Where? Research Division</strong> Bigger and better things right? Oh yes I guess.
Yes.
Research Division</strong> Anyway going back to the guidance.
First on the subject of O&amp;M could you maybe elaborate a little bit? Just EWC has a sort of litany of various things driving costs up.
Could you perhaps just have -- or provide a little bit more of a sense for next year as well as going forward into '14 and '15? What's kind of the trajectory if you will? Well some of the things -- as far as normal O&amp;M we've got increases associated with merit and compensation expense such as that.
Also we do have -- at EWC we've got higher maintenance expense because of the outage at RISEC next year.
Those go into that picture as well.
In terms of normal O&amp;M as it relates to what you see in the nuclear business obviously what we look at is any kind of costs that are associated with regulatory requirements and the like which have driven costs in the past.
And those are kind of the primary drivers of what we see next year and going forward plus the timing of refueling outages and amortization.
And we did have some changes this year because of what happened at Vermont Yankee as well because of the impairment.
Research Division</strong> Got you.
Is there a percentage number that you'd want to throw out there just for us on a modeling purpose basis? From a long-term point of view? Research Division</strong> Right.
Yes not particularly at the moment no.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then maybe on the second half there EWC again.
The economics in nuclear obviously have sort of come up of late following Dominion's announcement.
I'd be curious if you could just talk about your portfolio and I suppose VY in light of certain taxes that have been raised in Vermont potentially.
Julien this is Rick.
I mean we still think it's a good plan.
I mean we're pursuing it through the court and it -- in the Northeast market.
We're bullish going forward where market prices are.
And the taxes is not a big item that's going to determine for us whether or not we continue to operate that plan or not.
So -- and we're going to pursue additional fuel settlement taxes.
So at the end of the day we're still confident on our position on the taxes in Vermont.
We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Yes my congratulations Wayne and Leo too.
Thank you for everything Wayne over the years.
A quick question on dividend policy for the ongoing -- the sort of post-spin-merge company.
I remember the -- I think the assumption was that you were going to leave the dividend the same and the comments on the last quarterly call that you'd maybe have a higher payout and then grow into it over a period of time but obviously subject to the board.
Is that -- any -- is that still how we should think about this? Any change in sort of thinking around that? And then what type of payout would you be willing to weather for a period under that strategy? Jonathan it's Leo.
Wayne's looking at me.
He's looking at the wrong guy here.
Usually Wayne handles that question but I guess he is pushing that one off to me as -- this is part of transition.
The -- our thinking around the dividend post the ITC transaction hasn't changed.
The bottom line is the Utility sizes the dividend always has.
And buybacks come out of transaction-based items or out of the EWC or commodity-based businesses depending on what we're doing at any point in time.
What we've indicated all along as it relates to the dividend is that one it is a board decision; two you're going to be getting a dividend from both Entergy and ITC once the transaction occurs.
And when we look at the dividend post-transaction we'll be looking to size that dividend accordingly based on the prospects of the Utility business.
And when we looked at it originally we were looking at we have the potential to be able to grow into that dividend that we have today the $3.32 as the Utility continues to grow.
As far as overall payout ratio obviously do -- things do change and we're going to have to pay attention to not only what happens to EWC pricing and overall earnings and what that payout ratio looks like but also new investment opportunities at the Utility.
And so the thinking hasn't changed.
It's consistent with what we've been saying all along but we'll just have to look at where we stand when the time comes when we close on the transaction; what our dividend level is what the ITC dividend level is because you'll again be getting a dividend from both of us at that point in time; what our capital program looks like; and what overall earnings look like at that time as well.
Research Division</strong> So Leo then maybe just to clarify: are you saying that the combination of the Entergy and ITC bands would kind of be where we are today? Or the Entergy dividend itself is likely to stay where it is today? Because I think before it was -- that the ITC piece was kind of not to be part of the equation.
The ITC piece is part of the equation.
I'm not sure I'm -- I understand exactly what you mean by that...
Research Division</strong> By -- I thought originally the idea was that there would be a dividend that would be on the ITC piece but that the dividend on the ongoing company would kind of remain the same as today's dividend is and that -- you seem to be kind of linking the ITC piece to that now.
No.
Well originally when we've been looking at this certainly our intention is that you end up with more dividends after the transaction than you would have had without the transaction.
What we will be looking at when we make that decision is again the overall Entergy prospects what the ITC dividend is what our investment profile at the Utility looks like and what the overall payout ratio would be.
And to the extent that that supports $3.32 continuing then we may be able to grow into that Utility dividend.
The payout would be high relative to where we stand today on the Utility earnings piece.
But if we can grow into it that's something that we will consider at that time.
And that's what we were talking about when we announced the transaction in December.
And we will take our next question from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> Wayne we'll definitely miss you on these calls.
And Leo congratulations.
Just a quick maybe a little bit technical question on -- in the release it talks about moving a kind of allocation of earnings between EWC and the parent of about $0.40 a share.
Could you be a little more explicit what that relates to? And is this some kind of ongoing allocation that'll stay this way? And I think this is the second time there's been a change in allocation between segments the last few years.
I just want to make sure it's kind of representing it better going forward and why.
Well the why is to better align EWC activities within EWC.
We're actually moving a couple of legal entities the names of which you wouldn't recognize from the reporting segment that is Parent &amp; Other to the reporting segment that is EWC.
And what happens between those is you have some intercompany interest and you have some taxes that are really more closely aligned with the EWC business and so we're lining that up better.
And that's what that $0.40 is.
And it's probably I want to say 70-30 in terms of tax and interest.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So is there better kind of if we match up the debt out of EWC -- I guess the question is are you now allocating some of parent debt to EWC in this calculation or not or less of that? No no.
It's actually some intercompany loans that we're matching up.
We have time for one final question.
That will come from Greg Gordon of ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> So I just want to follow up on the question on the dividend.
So are you saying that this current $3.32 dividend might in fact be resized post the spinoff of ITC depending on the remaining earnings power and cash flow of the Utility? Or are you saying that you are going to maintain it? Well again Greg it -- we will make the decision at the time we close on the ITC transaction.
And we've always said that we'll make the decision and we'll size it based on those factors that I mentioned at the time of the transaction when it closes.
When we look at it where we -- when we were talking about sizing that up back in December when we announced the transaction we mentioned that as those things looked at the time it was possible that the $3.32 could stay in place and we could grow into that dividend.
So we're not really saying anything different right now other than we'll make that call at the time based on what happens during the 18-month-plus time frame between when we announced it and when we actually close.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
I guess I'll just -- in the context of you having lowered your net income growth aspiration for the core Utilities business from 6% to -- I think it was 6% to 8% or 6% to 9% to now 6% I guess there's the question of whether or not that puts you at a payout ratio at which you're somewhat uncomfortable with the current dividend.
Well again those are the kinds of things that change but it'll be more not what happens between now and 2014 but what happens in 2014 and beyond that'll drive that decision on the dividend.
And this does concludes today's Q&amp;A session.
At this time I'll turn the call back to Paula Waters for closing remarks.
Thank you Albert.
And thanks to all for participating.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statements.
Our call was recorded and can be accessed on our website or by dialing (719) 457-0820 replay code 5414008.
The recording will be available as soon as practical after the transcript is filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission due to filing requirements associated with the proposed spinoff and merger of Entergy's transmission business with ITC.
The telephone replay will be available through November 12 2012.
This concludes our call.
Thank you.
And this does conclude today's conference call.
We would like to thank everyone for your participation.
And have a wonderful day.
Good day and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time for instructions and opening comments I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead Ma'am.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] As part of today's conference call Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
On September 25 2012 ITC Holdings Corp.
filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC registering shares of ITC common stock to be issued to Entergy shareholders in conjunction with the proposed spin merge of our transmission business with ITC.
But this registration statement has not become effective.
In addition our subsidiary Mid South TransCo will file a registration statement with the SEC registering TransCo common units to be issued to Entergy shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions.
Entergy shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and the prospectus to be included in the TransCo registration statement and other relevant documents when available because they contain important information about ITC TransCo and the proposed transactions.
These documents when they are available can be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and can also be obtained free of charge upon written request to Entergy or ITC.
Now I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Thank you Paula.
Good morning everyone.
Today marks the turning of the page in Entergy's story.
Last week Wayne Leonard officially retired after a long and successful career that spanned nearly 40 years.
He leaves behind a legacy as a tremendous and inspiring leader to all of us.
Rick Smith also retired last week.
Both Wayne and Rick will be missed.
They will be missed not only because of their tremendous leadership and counsel but also as dear friends of the many of us they have touched throughout more than a decade here at Entergy.
That said they leave the company and the management team well prepared for the challenges and opportunities ahead.
As a result we have 2 new participants on the call with us today.
Drew Marsh Chief Financial Officer who you will hear from shortly to review results; and Bill Mohl President of Entergy Wholesale Commodities who assumed the top EWC box from Rick.
They join those you already know Rod West our Chief Administrative Officer; Theo Bunting Group President of Utility operations; Mark Savoff Chief Operating Officer; Renae Conley Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Administration; and Marcus Brown General Counsel.
Also with me today for his last earnings call is John Herron.
When he announced his retirement as our Chief Nuclear Officer in December John agreed to stay on through March to help with the transition.
During his 12 years at Entergy and over his 33-year career John made significant contributions to safe and successful nuclear operations.
Most recently he oversaw the nuclear organization through 2 major construction projects completed last year.
The 178-megawatt Grand Gulf upgrade in June and the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project in December.
John is succeeded by Jeff Forbes.
Over the past 14 years the depth of our nuclear leadership has been clear through seamless transition at the Chief Nuclear Officer role.
We have no doubt the time is right for Jeff to take the reins.
You will meet and get to know Jeff in future earnings calls at conferences and other events.
I've said before but it bears repeating one of the greatest gifts Wayne left to me was this leadership team.
Together we have a combined industry experience of nearly 240 years.
We are facing a period of not just the well-documented challenges but also opportunities.
I know the team assembled here today is up to the task.
Everyone is focused on one overarching goal to create sustainable value for our 4 key stakeholders our owners our customers our communities and our employees.
I know all of those stakeholders are listening in today and many of you have asked what will change? Undoubtedly some things will.
First of all the world around us will continue to evolve.
Entergy's point-of-view driven business focus that led to significant value created over the last 14 years will not change.
It is designed to identify and adapt to changes in our business technology economy and a host of other factors.
But I can also promise you this our values as a company will not change.
Safety is the top priority.
I can also assure you we will never change our commitment to integrity to transparency to community service and to just doing the right thing.
Another thing that won't change is our commitment to successfully execute on the initiatives before us now.
And now as in the past I'll give you an update on where things stand.
But before I get there let me take a quick moment to talk about what's been in the news a lot since Sunday night and that's the power outage that occurred during the Super Bowl.
We spent the past week doing everything we can to see what happened.
And you might have seen this morning that we traced the cause of Sunday's outage to an electrical relay device.
We've now taken the device out of service and we certainly do regret the interruption that occurred that night.
Overall the Super Bowl game itself and the festivities surrounding was a huge success.
We're also proud to have been a part of it and thought the city did a fabulous job.
A true showcase for a city ideally suited for such events.
Our objective like everyone else's is to get the Super Bowl back in New Orleans in 2018 the 300th anniversary of the city.
Now moving to our proposal for each utility operating company to join the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator or MISO following favorable actions by the Louisiana Public Service Commission the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Arkansas Public Service Commission a milestone was reached on November 15.
On that date the Mississippi Public Service Commission and the City Council of New Orleans granted their approvals of the MISO requests subject to certain conditions.
Teams are fully focused on completing the numerous operational and regulatory steps required for cutover to MISO on December 19 of this year.
Following the PUCT's decision granting Entergy Texas's application to transfer operational control of its transmission assets to MISO subject to certain conditions significant issues arose relating to certain power purchase agreements that were put in place at the time of the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States some 5 years ago.
Before briefly going through the details I want to say this.
Our priority right now is to continue to work with the staff of the PUCT to resolve this issue.
We believe their concerns as well as those of the commission can be addressed in a way that works for everyone.
To summarize at issue are PPAs between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas that relate to natural gas and oil-fired units.
At the time the Entergy Gulf States was split into 2 companies plant ownership was assigned according to state lines.
The cross-PPAs allowed for each company to have access to the capacity of the others' plants in the same ratio as before the split.
These arrangements helped to minimize shifts in production cost as a result of the jurisdictional separation.
Much discussion and analysis have occurred in the course of the last 2 months with respect to the effect on those PPAs of either joining MISO or Entergy Texas exiting from this system agreement.
But what's important here is that our updated analysis has concluded that Entergy Texas will be in essentially the same position with or without the PPAs.
An evaluation by an independent third party is underway now to thoroughly vet this updated analysis including its inputs assumptions and the methodology.
In any event we have committed to preserving the principles of jurisdictional separation I mentioned earlier.
Clearly we had a misunderstanding that we wish had not happened but we are working to resolve the issue and move forward so that all of our customers can realize the benefits of joining MISO.
Additional benefits for customers and other stakeholders can and should be achieved through a complete independence of the transmission business.
The proposed transaction to spin off and merge the transmission business with ITC Holdings does just that and it is clearly a superior business model.
We now have procedural schedules in all retail jurisdictions where we've filed.
Generally they call for direct testimony of staff or in the case of New Orleans the advisers and intervenors to begin in March and continue through midyear.
Successive hearing dates are set for late June through early August.
Specific dates in each procedural schedule are provided in the appendix to the webcast slides.
Other upcoming steps at the retail jurisdictional level include filing a transaction approval request in Texas and Missouri.
As a reminder Texas must render a decision on change of control within 180 days of filing.
As a result the timing of the Texas filing will take into account the status of the change in control filings in other jurisdictions.
At the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission protests and interventions were filed by the January deadline.
We are reviewing the filings and we'll submit Entergy's and ITC's response to the issues to help clarify the record.
But I would say this the issues raised are consistent with those that have come out of the stakeholder engagement process we've been jointly undertaking with ITC since the announcement in December of 2011.
We did clear one requirement for the transaction.
On January 14 the waiting period expired under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act without action.
We continue to target closing in 2013.
In other utility developments I'm pleased to report significant strides in our investment program over the past 3 months.
On November 30 we closed the acquisitions of the Hot Spring and Hinds power plants in Arkansas and Mississippi.
These modern efficient natural gas-fired plants provide benefits for our customers in the form of lower energy costs.
Then in December we put in service the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project.
It will allow for continued safe operation providing fuel diversity to mitigate risks for our customers today and well into the future.
In all 3 investments our regulators were supportive by approving cost recovery mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag to a matter of days and weeks.
In doing so regulators recognized the importance to the customers to facilitate investment through timely recovery mechanisms that help to maintain the utility's credit-rating at a reasonable level and support access to capital on reasonable terms.
The recovering rates today for the Waterford 3 cost is subject to a standard prudence review to be initiated no later than April 30.
Our regulators' foresight helps to position the utilities well for the future as the needs for investment continue at elevated levels to deliver reliable affordable power to our customers.
Long-established legal principles also provide the foundation as we enter the year with 3 major rate cases and the ROE inquiry in Mississippi.
Clearly we have concerns in Texas.
After a disappointing rate case decision last year we are pursuing 3 parallel paths.
First on November 30 we filed a request for special circumstances recovery of approximately $15.5 million annually of capacity costs through the fuel adjustment clause.
We are seeking to remedy through a good cause exception the commission's denial in our base rate case of recovery of capacity costs that provide economic and reliability benefits to our customers.
Second that same day a draft purchased capacity rider rule was published in the Texas Register.
Procedurally the PUCT must act by May 31.
If approved Entergy Texas will immediately assess options in filing for cost recovery.
Third we appealed the 2012 rate case decision in Travis County District Court.
We expect to know more as the year progresses.
In addition we always have the option of filing a new base rate case at the appropriate time.
To that last point the due date for the Louisiana rate cases was extended by 2 weeks and the Entergy Arkansas rate case will be filed in March.
Before moving on I know many of you are tracking the ROE proceeding in the Entergy Gulf States Louisiana natural gas business.
We do not believe the 9.4% draft recommendation from the Administrative Law Judge is supported by the facts.
Our testimony points to no less than 10.1%.
A final ALJ recommendation is pending.
After that the matter will be referred to the LPSC for decision at a future meeting.
It is impotent to note that all parties have acknowledged that ROEs for natural gas distribution businesses are lower than for electric utilities.
Turning to Entergy wholesale commodities.
I would point out that once again the fleet ran safely and securely this quarter.
The nuclear plants operated at a 90% capacity factor even with a 2-week outage caused by a transformer failure at Fitzpatrick.
For the nonnuclear fleet capacity factor was 39%.
In addition we continued hedging efforts.
Notably we increased 2015 nuclear energy hedge by 14%.
We continue to evaluate the costs opportunities and risks associated with all hedging product options consistent with the objectives of providing downside protection against the nuclear fleet cost structures and protecting our credit metrics.
Our point of view guides our evaluation of hedging products and execution timing.
As we've said before we are bullish longer-term relative to the current forward curve.
That said prices are what they are.
Near-term power prices are challenging for some merchant nuclear generating units in certain competitive markets.
We have not made any decisions to shut down any of our merchant nuclear plants.
We are continually assessing our businesses and investments based on our analytical dynamic point of view approach.
Our business plans must be flexible to adopt to high and low price markets and must balance short and long-term views.
The fact is some plants are in more challenging economic situations for a variety of factors.
Such as the market for both energy and capacity their size their contracted positions and the investment required to maintain the safety and integrity of the plants.
It'll come as no surprise to you that some of our EWC nuclear plants are challenged.
While we will not get into the specifics around the individual EWC plant economics I will say that there are years when certain plants' cash flows can be negative at today's forward price curve.
In the near-term we will continue to be diligent and operate as efficiently as possible.
We will do whatever it takes to maintain the safety and the integrity of the plants.
We will also advocate for efficient markets in recognition of the many benefits nuclear plants offer to our communities and our customers including the source of clean energy with effectively 0 air emissions grid reliability supported by low forced outage rates and fuel diversity and jobs and other contributions to the regional economy.
In addition to economics EWC efforts continued towards securing necessary approvals for long-term operations of Vermont Yankee and Indian Point.
Regarding Vermont Yankee oral argument at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals was held on January 14 before a three-judge panel.
As a reminder this case involves the state of Vermont's appeal of the January 2011 Federal District Court ruling invalidating certain state laws regarding continued operation and barring the state from requiring a below-market PPA as a condition for continued operation.
A decision could come by midyear.
Two days later we participated in a hearing at the Vermont Supreme Court.
This state court hearing concerned a claim by an intervenor group that Vermont Yankee was operating in violation of past Vermont Public Service Board orders.
Next steps will be established by the state court.
However given the federal district court rulings and the absence of any state ruling prohibiting operation we will continue to operate until final decisions are reached in the federal case and in the Certificate of Public Good proceeding before the VPSB.
Our right to continue operating is supported by representations to the federal district court by the Vermont Attorney General.
Also at the state level hearings on direct testimony in the CPG proceeding will be held next week.
Additional testimony hearings and briefings are scheduled through August of this year.
A board decision is expected by year-end.
Regarding Indian Point the proceedings continued concerning the various license renewal efforts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in the state of New York.
We expect these processes to continue for many years during which we have the right to continue to operate the units.
In addition I know many of you are tracking the Energy Highway initiative and other developments in New York.
In November the New York State Public Service Commission directed Con Edison in consultation with the New York Power Authority to develop a reliability contingency plan for the potential retirement of Indian Point by the end of 2015.
The Public Service Commission stated it was not taking a position on the potential closure of Indian Point but providing potential solutions to maintain reliability in New York in the event of power plant closures.
Such planning is common by utilities and appropriate.
EWC has and will continue to participate in this process.
Because we submitted a timely and sufficient application for a renewed license and given the status of the NRC proceeding we fully expect that the plant will be operating well beyond 2015.
In 2013 I know I don't have to remind you we have a full regulatory agenda at the utility.
In the first quarter we will make base rate case filings for Entergy Louisiana Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Arkansas.
Final decisions are expected by year-end or in early 2014.
The first quarter will also include the annual formula rate plan filing in Mississippi.
Just this week the MPSC approved the settlement in the 2011 test year filing confirming performance within the ROE bandwidth therefore no change in rates.
In addition Entergy New Orleans will continue its efforts to resolve its 2011 test year FRP filing.
In conjunction with those negotiations ENOI will be seeking a short-term extension of its FRP for an additional year until the next full base rate filing currently targeted for 2014.
This rate case filing is a condition in the city council's approval for Entergy New Orleans' 20% participation in the 550-megawatt Ninemile 6 combined cycle plant which is under construction now.
The new plant is currently expected to go into service the first part of 2015 and the base rate case is to be filed one year prior to the estimated in-service day.
In addition 5 of the 6 utility operating companies will seek cost recovery of extraordinary storm costs in 2012.
In January we used cash storm reserves for Hurricane Isaac in the amounts of $187 million for Entergy Louisiana and $65 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.
Entergy New Orleans will also seek to recover Isaac costs as well as replenish its cash storm reserves.
Recall that the city council originally approved a $75 million fund to be accumulated over 10 years.
Since that approval in 2006 damages from hurricanes Gustav Ike and Isaac have totaled approximately $80 million.
Entergy Arkansas will present a cost recovery proposal to the APSC in its upcoming base rate filing to recover the $55 million to $65 million of costs for the December 25 ice storm.
And finally Entergy Mississippi will consider the level of storm accrual in its now annual audit process.
2012 was once again a year when the Entergy region was hit by both hurricanes and ice storms.
We also assisted in the June mid-Atlantic and Midwest wind storm event and Superstorm Sandy recovery events.
I'm proud to tell you that the Edison Electric Institute has awarded us the 2012 Emergency Response and Assistance Awards.
This makes 19 awards we have won in 15 consecutive years.
As you know but it doesn't hurt to repeat it we are the only utility in the country to win a response award every year since the inception in 1998.
This year EEI recognized our restoration work on Isaac and our assistant work on the windstorms and Sandy.
Finally in 2013 the utility will focus on regulatory and operational efforts.
Those include the successful completion and integration into MISO and the closing of the ITC transaction as well as continuing the utility' construction program including the Ninemile 6 plant.
At EWC we will continue our ongoing hedging efforts to meet the objectives I discussed earlier.
While we expect the Indian Point license renewal proceedings to continue for some time you will likely see decisions regarding Vermont Yankee before the federal and state courts as well as at the Vermont Public Service Board.
We will analyze those carefully and evaluate next steps from there.
While there are a number of regulatory operational and legal initiatives underway throughout the company I know that each and every day safety and operational excellence will be at the forefront for all employees.
Providing safe secure reliable and affordable power to our customers is central to each and every one of us.
Looking back 2012 was an eventful year.
We achieved many operational and financial accomplishments.
After ups and downs during the year our final 2012 operational earnings per share exceeded our original guidance range.
I understand that many of you take out items like tax settlements.
To that end excluding the net tax benefits above the original guidance assumption of a 34% effective income tax rate puts us around the midpoint of our revised 2012 operational guidance range of $5.25 per share.
As you'll recall the reduction in our guidance range was driven by external factors namely higher pension expense due to lower interest rates and updated actuarial experience studies milder than normal weather at the utility and lower market power prices at EWC.
Operationally there were numerous accomplishments company-wide last year.
I've mentioned a number of them already.
Other operational achievements include all of the utility companies continued gains in the J.D.
Power and Associates 2012 Electric Utility Customer Satisfaction study.
Entergy New Orleans was named the Most Improved Utility Company and 4 of our utilities were among the top 8 performance in proactive outage communications.
The nuclear fleet completed back -- breaker to breaker runs at Grand Gulf and Cooper and 2 back-to-back breaker-to-breaker runs at Fitzpatrick.
The company received multiple awards and recognitions for community relations corporate citizenship climate protection and customer service.
In closing as you look at Entergy today it represents a strong utility and service territories with solid economic growth constructive regulatory relationships manageable environmental risks and low-cost electricity during a time of rising investment needs.
And a merchant generation business with safe and reliable plants that will benefit from the recovery of power markets.
These businesses have and will continue to support return of capital to our owners to our financial outlook with our current mix of businesses that support the dividend at the current level and dividend growth potential for shareholders upon execution of the ITC transaction through the combination of Entergy and ITC dividends and a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.
At the same time this leadership team will not relent on looking for opportunities to make things better for all of our stakeholders.
Even if they are hard even if they take time the MISO and ITC transactions are examples of that.
Throughout all of this you can be assured we are fully focused on executing on your high expectations for us every day.
Now I will turn the call over to Drew.
Drew? Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results cash performance for the quarter and the full year and 2013 earnings guidance.
Now let's turn to the financial results for the quarter.
Slide 2 summarizes fourth quarter 2012 results on an as reported and operational basis.
Operational earnings per share were $0.78 higher compared to a year ago driven by higher earnings at Utility and Parent &amp; Other while results were lower at EWC.
Fourth quarter as reported earnings included a special item for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed spinoff and merger of Entergy's transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp.
Spending on our spin merge initiative reduced earnings per share by $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus the $0.07 per share recorded for this item in 2011.
Slide 3 summarizes the major drivers by segment.
Starting at the utility results were higher in 2012 due primarily to lower income tax expense and higher net revenue.
These are partially offset by higher depreciation expense.
The utility's income tax expense was lower due primarily to the recent settlement with the IRS on the tax treatment of the utility's decommissioning liabilities.
In this settlement we conceded a position that we took in the 2004 return on including the utility's nuclear decommissioning liabilities in cost of goods sold.
As part of the settlement Entergy Louisiana also increased the tax basis of its assets which entitled the company to approximately $550 million of additional tax depreciation for the tax years 2006 and beyond.
This part of the settlement created a permanent book to tax difference and as a result an income tax expense benefit net of interest of approximately $155 million was recorded in the fourth quarter.
Utility also realized higher net revenue compared to the same period in 2011.
The net revenue increase was due primarily to weather adjusted sales growth and the net effect of pricing adjustments from regulatory actions and investments some of which were partially offset by increased expenses.
Weather for the quarter was milder than normal but roughly in line with the fourth quarter of 2011.
On a weather adjusted basis retail sales were up 0.8% quarter-over-quarter.
Growth in the residential and commercial sectors more than offset lower industrial sales.
Furthermore the decline in billed industrial sales volume was driven by temporary outages at 2 major customers.
At EWC earnings declined due largely to lower operational adjusted EBITDA which I will review shortly.
Other factors included a higher effective income tax rates and higher decommissioning expense.
Decommissioning expense increased quarter-over-quarter due to a favorable adjustment to the decommissioning liability recorded in 2011 at Vermont Yankee.
At Parent &amp; Other results improved quarter-over-quarter due primarily to lower income tax expense.
Slide 4 summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of each year.
The quarter-over-quarter decline of $32 million was due primarily to lower net revenue driven by lower nuclear energy power prices.
Slide 5 recaps our cash flow performance for the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $720 million approximately $280 million lower than the prior year.
The main drivers of the overall decrease were lower deferred fuel collection non-capital cost from Hurricane Isaac restoration and lower net revenue at EWC.
These decreases were offset partially by lower pension contributions.
Now I'll move to full year results.
Slide 6 compares 2012 as reported and operational earnings for 2011.
On an operational basis 2012 earnings per share ended the year at $6.23 down from $7.62 per share in 2011.
Lower operational earnings at the Utility and EWC were partially offset by higher results at Parent &amp; Other.
The main drivers for the decrease were: differences in tax benefits resulting largely from the net effects of agreements with the IRS in 2011 and 2012 as well as other income tax adjustments; lower operational adjusted EBITDA at each EWC; and higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense at the Utility due partly to higher compensation and benefit costs.
Other factors in the year-over-year decline were increases in interest expense and depreciation expense.
Higher utility net revenue partially offset these items.
Slide 7 summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for 2011 and 2012.
As with the quarterly drivers a decline in net revenue on lower energy pricing was the primary factor in the $244 million decrease.
The decrease was partially offset by additional net revenue from the RISEC facility which was acquired in December of 2011.
Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense and higher taxes other than income taxes also reduced EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA.
Slide 8 summarizes our cash flow performance for the full year.
For 2012 operating cash flow was $2.9 billion down from $3.1 billion in 2011.
Drivers of the decrease included lower net revenue at EWC noncapital costs from Hurricane Isaac restoration and higher income tax payments.
These items were partially offset by lower pension contributions.
Slide 9 summarizes our 2013 earnings guidance range.
The as reported guidance does not reflect potential future expenses for the special item in connection with the proposed spin merge of Entergy's transmission business.
As reported earnings guidance will be updated as actual costs are incurred.
In keeping with past practice we have updated a few line items in the guidance table including final 2012 results major income tax variances and final 2012 weather effects.
In affirming our earnings guidance we have noted that current expectations point to the lower half of the $0.80 range due to updated pension and post retirement cost estimates which came in approximately $0.17 per share below the midpoint assumption.
With 11 months to go in the year it is still early.
And even though current estimates do point to the bottom half of the guidance range we are committed to deliver optimal results.
We will continue to focus on opportunities to improve our business including managing everyday costs and looking for ways to safely improve efficiency and effectiveness through continuous improvement and operational excellence.
One last point on 2013 as it relates to quarterly results.
While we do not provide quarterly guidance Slide 10 outlines some key events to keep in mind when considering the quarters.
We had several tax items in 2012 both positive and negative.
In addition the second quarter results included a regulatory charge to reflect sharing of certain tax benefits with customers.
2012 EPS also reflected some variation from quarter-to-quarter associated with weather and normal seasonality.
Regulatory actions and completion of major projects such as the Grand Gulf extended power upgrade which was placed in service in mid-2012 can also affect quarterly timing.
At EWC the second quarter of 2012 included an adjustment to the decommissioning liability which reduced expense by $0.16 per share.
Third and fourth quarter results also reflected awards for Indian Point 2 and Vermont Yankee respectively arising out of the Department of Energy's failure to provide timely spent fuel storage.
These awards resulted in the reversal of certain previously recorded expenses.
In closing Leo outlined a vision to create sustainable value for each of the 4 key stakeholders through focus on both operational excellence and portfolio management.
We must successfully identify productive investments at the Utility which benefit customers and grow business execute on hedging strategies at EWC that protects the value of those assets while also providing upside price opportunity develop ways to improve efficiency and manage risks more effectively throughout the company and execute on key initiatives.
Initiatives such as the effort to join MISO the spin merge of the transmission business and ongoing efforts to ensure our ability to run our nuclear plant through an extended license period.
These actions will enable us to achieve the vision and to meet our long-term financial outlook for robust utility earnings growth EWC option value preservation solid capital deployment and strong liquidity and credit quality.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Research Division</strong> Quick first question here for you.
On the -- given all the rate cases upcoming what were your earned regulatory ROEs across your jurisdictions? And I'm specifically thinking about 2012 for those jurisdictions where you're filing? Theo? In 2012 I think if you look at what the earned ROEs were they were -- actually they were within -- a little above the allowed ROEs in the jurisdictions where we're talking about filing principally Arkansas and Louisiana.
So as it relates to 2012 ROEs in those jurisdictions were fairly close to slightly above the allowed ROEs.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And sorry you said Arkansas and Louisiana? Correct.
Research Division</strong> And then with respect to Texas if you could just comment where that is and perhaps specifically in the back half of the year and how that's trending given the PPA? I mean obviously as Leo spoke earlier we have our challenges in Texas and as you would expect given the impacts we talked about realistically in the filing of our rate case if you remember back a couple of quarters ago on the impact.
Not recovering that capacity cost would help on ROEs.
And we talked about ROEs maybe impacting earned ROEs to a level of somewhere close to 6% and obviously you'll see that impact in 2012 in Texas.
So obviously it's not as nice a picture as say Arkansas and Louisiana.
But as Leo laid out we do have options in terms of how we'll work to address that and that's our objective and goal in 2013 is to pursue the paths we have available to improve that result.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then just turning to the EWC segment for a quick second.
Obviously the New England results came out the other day can you indicate whether you committed Vermont Yankee into that auction and whether it cleared by chance? Julian this is Bill.
We did actually commit VY and it did clear.
And you may ask a question why did we do that? As we haven't in the past but now that that unit has been delisted it's not considered a reliability must-run unit that takes away a lot of our relicensing risk as it relates to the CPG issues.
So that in the event that we would encounter any problems we could replace it with a fungible product.
And we will take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Leo just kind of following up on the comment you made earlier.
Just -- you're at the daily cash generation of the assets in how you evaluate keeping the plants in service.
What do you need to see market condition wise maybe to change your opinion on whether these assets stay in service and is there some sort of time line you guys think about to try and address some of those questions? Well as far as the time line goes Dan it's -- as you might guess it's an ongoing time line.
We never stop and we never start it's just always something that we would be doing regardless of what's going.
As far as absolute levels we are not going to get into the specifics around plant economics at this price or that price.
But suffice it to say that it's the kind the thing that we look at on an ongoing basis.
We've always look at it on ongoing basis as it relates to every decision we make whether it be continued operation with it be hedging or whether it be any kind of portfolio management activity that might be around those assets.
So there's no specific time line other than making sure that we're doing everything with our eyes wide open.
The big time periods are obviously when you have CapEx that goes into it or something like that where you've got to make an assessment of how much money you're going to spend going forward.
And so if there's a time frame around which you make more decisions rather than less it has to do with big changes in cost structure for example a big CapEx program or if there was something else that happened.
But otherwise it's just an ongoing evaluation.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I guess just with the utilities the weather normalized demand growth was seemingly well above trend for what we saw across the country.
Although we did see industrial trail off a bit in the fourth quarter.
Can you just kind of talk about the mix of the 1.25% growth for '13 and where you see the most positive signs and the most concerning issues right now? You really faded out there Dan so I'm not sure.
I think you asked the load growth question.
So I think Theo can answer that.
Dan do you mind kind of just repeating the last portion of that? As Leo said you were fading out.
Research Division</strong> I was just wondering with power demand growth you guys had a good 2012 weather normalized relative to the rest of the country.
What do you guys see as the trend for '13? And from a mix perspective is residential going to continue to be so strong or is commercial catching up or how do you guys see that kind of evolving this year? I think when you -- we think about 2012 2012 ended up pretty much in line with what we expected as it relates to growth.
Not only overall but really even among some of the specific customer classes particularly residential.
As we look to 2013 I think as we said earlier we had -- I believe 2012 we ended at about 1.9% weather adjusted.
2013 I believe we mentioned on the last call we were expecting somewhere in the range of 1.3%.
So obviously you see that moving down a little bit.
And I think we will obviously -- it's moving down because of things you'll probably see with other companies primarily in the area of residential energy efficiency programs that have caused changes relative to -- I mean speak to government programs around lighting and such.
So we do see some impacts in residential as it relates to that.
We are optimistic that maybe it won't be as impacting it as much as we may think at this point in time.
In the industrial we tailed off second half of the year much as we had expected primarily because of outages.
In 2012 we continue to see GDP much above the national average which as we spoken of many times has helped to differentiate us to some extent as it relates to sales volumes.
I think as you go into 2013 if you look at some of the projections around GDP that gap starts to close.
So we will probably tend to trend more to what you may see with -- across other utilities in the country.
But what I'll also say is we still continue to be a place for opportunities as it relates to economic development and potential new industrial customers.
So we'll continue to keep our eyes on that and obviously as those things materialize and mature you will start to see the impact of those.
Hopefully we'll see them in our service area.
If not in our service area you will see the impacts they may create even if they're in other service areas where they could potentially affect us through some of the impacts of changes as it relates to commercial and residential even in support of those if those industrial customers are not in our area.
And we will go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock.
I just wanted to ask you guys about -- there's a decommissioning dispute that was talked about in the press this week with another company nothing to do with you guys.
Just wondering I'm not going to ask you to comment on that but I'm just wondering are you -- have you guys had any interaction with the NRC? Is this something that you've heard about either in your neck of the -- I mean with your plants or what have you or just any ideas about -- have there been any disputes about decommissioning calculations or any kind of review that's sort of generally generically happening at the NRC? I'll let John Herron address that.
Yes.
We are very familiar with the issue that you're talking about.
Again we don't have all the details.
The Office of Investigation has concluded their investigation on that issue.
I will tell you that we are very familiar with the decommissioning rules and regulations and the submittals that we have to provide to the NRC.
We've had some discussions with the NRC about one of our sites.
We worked that out and resolved that issue but clearly not a 50.9 issue which is what the NRC concluded with that utility decommissioning submittal.
We are familiar with it certainly have done a lot of detailed understanding of what went behind that and clearly we don't have that same issue.
Okay great.
And then there was an article just today I think I saw on how the state of Vermont I guess is perhaps looking at some legislation.
It doesn't sound like it's a huge amount of money but it looks like there's sort of a $40 million potential that they're concerned about higher needs for decommissioning expense from a state perspective it sounded to me from reading the article as opposed to the federal level.
Does the state have any -- I mean generally speaking my understanding is decommissioning and the requirements associated with that are completely federal.
Is that pretty much the case or is there -- are there some other sort of decommissioning or cleanup costs that states might have if there was in fact decommissioning happening? This is Rod West.
The rules relative to decommissioning are federal federal jurisdiction in nature.
We were not at all and have not been surprised by Vermont's efforts to test the limits of the federal jurisdiction and to assert whatever state's rights or concerns they'd have around the decommissioning issue from a state interest perspective.
But it is from our point of view primarily a federal question and those are the rules that we are seeking to abide by.
And there were examples of -- do you know of any examples where the state actually does have authority over something like that? I can't comment on it.
Sorry I wish I could be more helpful there.
And we will go next to Kit Konolige with BGC Brokerage.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> To follow-up a little bit on the question about the earned ROEs would it be possible to project in the guidance for '13 what earned ROEs are embedded in those expectations? Kit this is Theo I mean we just don't get into that discussion.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay fair enough.
And the other area I just wanted to follow on a little bit was on the PPA issue with the Texas Commission.
Do you have a sense of what the timing might be on that and kind of what boxes need to be checked there who needs to be satisfied about what at this point? Theo? Sure.
At this point as Leo mentioned we've prepared an updated analysis.
That analysis is now being reviewed by -- with what we consider kind of an independent third party.
Again as Leo discussed and we expect that process to click -- go on through the month of February more than likely.
And at that point we would hope that their analysis will be complete somewhere within that time line and we would then have an opportunity to see the results all other party see the result.
And if that analysis obviously aligns with what we have done then we would hope we could move this forward and folks would be comfortable again that whether the PPAs -- whether you exit the system agreement the PPAs stay in place or not the economic effect is effectively the same.
And we do believe that's a major concern and we understand that concern.
And so we're moving that.
We are optimistic it will allow us to move this issue along.
If you had an opportunity to view the open meeting in which this was discussed there was some discussion around how that would move.
It wasn't very -- it wasn't completely clear but obviously we know our starting point is with the staff out of PUCT and getting the staff comfortable with the body of work that's being done and giving them an opportunity to weigh in on that from their perspective and obviously what the staff views will be communicated up to the commission and we'll just have to see how it moves at that point.
But our expectation is we're doing everything we can and we believe other parties are as well to move this along as quickly as possible.
And we believe all signatories to the NUS are obviously interested in getting to MISO as quickly as possible so customers can achieve those benefits.
So we are optimistic this will move along on a quick pace.
And we will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Guys just real quickly on Texas.
At what point -- I guess my question there is there something about Gulf States Texas that leads to a lower earned ROE than what some of the other utilities regulated utilities in Texas generally earn.
Is there something that is specific to Gulf States that tends to drive that? And I'm thinking not just in 2012 or 2013 but just over the last 5 or 10 years.
I'm trying to think about whether it's a structural issue with the market or a structural issue with the company.
Theo? I mean obviously we're operating in a market where we're still a vertically integrated utility and subject to full jurisdiction by the PUCT.
So there is no kind of market -- wholesale market type of issues.
If you go back a few years I mean over the past 3 or 4 years we've had successful rate outcomes in Texas and we are moving in our view toward a very positive path as it relates to returning to a position to earn our allowed ROEs.
At the last rate case we took a step back.
And right now our objective is to get back on that path of moving in a positive direction and heading in a positive direction of earning allowed ROEs.
I can't say that structurally there's anything different from us as it relates to operating in a vertical integrated utility market than any other vertically integrated utility.
We'll just -- we'll keep working it and we've had past success and we believe we'll have success in the future.
And we will take our final question from Neel Mitra with Tudor Pickering &amp; Holt.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.
Research Division</strong> A question on kind of the weak nuclear economics.
How are you looking at unit contingent hedging right now? Are you thinking about using less of those hedges and would you be open to acquiring another CCGT like in New England like in New York to maybe held backstop some of the nuclear plants? Bill? I mean the certain part of our portfolio continues to include unit contingent hedges.
As Leo mentioned we've taken more of an approach to protect our downside and leave opportunities for the upside.
And right now we think that's probably the best way to approach it.
As it relates to adding additional assets it's pretty similar to anything that we would do.
We are always looking at opportunities in the marketplace but those opportunities have to provide value.
And so I wouldn't exclude that.
As a specific opportunity we currently have no specific plans to acquire any specific assets at this point in time.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just as a follow-up.
On the New York capacity markets could you update us with your thoughts for the expectation for a lower Hudson Valley capacity zone and maybe the timing of that? Sure.
We are cautiously optimistic that we will see that zone go into effect in the summer of '14.
However there are still a lot of details to be worked out regarding the various rules and procedures that will apply to that pricing zone.
So we're actively engaged in that and trying to make sure that when that zone is put in place that the capacity prices associated with that are consistent with the competitive market and not suppressed due to issues such as minimum offer price rules or out of market entry that type of thing.
So we are optimistic that's going to happen.
That concludes today's question and answer session.
Ms.
Waters at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Thank you Angela and thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statements.
Our call was recorded and can be accessed on our website or by dialing (719) 457-0820 replay code 6847131.
The recording will be available as soon as practical after the transcript is filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission due to filing requirements associated with the proposed spinoff and merger of Entergy's transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp.
The telephone replay will be available through February 15 2013.
This concludes our call.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference.
We thank you for your participation.
Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation First Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time introductions and opening comments I would like to turn the call over to Vice President Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] As part of today's conference call Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
ITC filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC registering the offer and sell of shares of ITC common stock to be issued to Entergy's shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions.
This registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on February 25 2013.
ITC shareholders are urged to read the prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and any other relevant documents because they contain important information about Transco and the proposed transactions.
In addition Transco will file a registration statement with the SEC registering the offer and sale of Transco common units to be issued to Entergy's shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions.
Entergy's shareholders are urged to read the prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and the prospectus to be included in the Transco registration statement when available and any other relevant documents because they contain important information about ITC Transco and the proposed transactions.
The registration statements prospectuses and other documents related to the proposed transactions when they're available can be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and can also be obtained free of charge upon written request to Entergy or ITC.
Now I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Thanks Paula and good morning everyone.
As Paula said I will give some opening comments before Drew reviews the details on what was a very solid first quarter.
Over the past 3 months the executive leadership team has spent a lot of time making sure we are focused at every level of the organization in what we are trying to accomplish and how we plan to get there.
I want to take some time this morning to share some of what we've discussed with all of you.
Before doing so I would be remiss if I did not mention the tragic accident that occurred at the Arkansas Nuclear One plant on March 31.
First and foremost our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the ironworker who lost his life as well as the other workers who were injured when a crane carrying a 550-ton piece of equipment collapsed as it was moving the component out of the turbine building which is a non-nuclear area of the plant.
We are deeply saddened by this event.
Drew will touch on where we stand in the process in a moment but I wanted to express our appreciation for all of the employees who are working tirelessly to restore order and get both units back online in a safe manner to provide a clean and reasonably priced power for our Arkansas customers.
Now the opportunities that lie ahead of us are great.
We've distilled these opportunities into 7 strategic imperatives that benefit our key stakeholders owners customers employees and the communities we serve.
I will go through each strategic imperative in turn and in doing so I will include an update on recent key events.
To repeat something we've said many times before we first have to do the basic things right each and everyday including being safe in all we do operating efficiently and maintaining secure facilities complying with all regulatory and legal requirements providing excellent customer service and keeping the lights on the gas flowing and providing chilled water and steam.
This operational excellence component of our business model is the key to making sure we are successful.
And while we spend a large amount of time talking about the more strategic moves we make operational excellence is where most of us spend the majority of our time each day and it enables us to focus on the strategic imperatives.
The first strategic imperative relates to initiatives we've talked about quite a bit over the last 2 or 3 years.
Execute on the MISO and ITC initiatives.
There are significant benefits to customers of approximately $1.4 billion projected in the first decade from the Entergy operating companies joining the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator or MISO.
Savings to customers lowers their bills and improves our ability to fund a future investment.
Joining MISO also reduces risk for owners and other key stakeholders by transferring functional control to a mature entity.
The targeted cutover to MISO is December 18.
Events during the first quarter include the final order in Arkansas conditionally approving Entergy Arkansas joining MISO allowing the company to cease efforts on the standalone option; completion by an independent consultant of a review of Entergy Texas' updated analysis of the rate impact of cross-jurisdictional power purchase agreements expiring when Entergy Texas exits from the system agreement; and filings in Missouri providing notification of Entergy Arkansas' intent to join MISO.
Regarding that last item as part of the ITC filing process in Missouri interventions by a few parties have raised MISO issues.
These Missouri filings were made to resolve the issues and ensure we go to MISO later this year.
Turning to the ITC transaction it is the right transaction at the right time with the right partner.
We know that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was directed by congress to provide a more reliable technologically advanced grid interconnected on a super-regional and national basis with better access to generating resources that can lower cost to customers.
Historically the fragmentation of the industry and the focus on connecting load and resources within limited regional boundaries have frustrated this objective.
The addition of Regional Transmission Organizations to the mix has had a positive impact but is not in and of itself enough.
Therefore in order to fulfill the objective of a more reliable grid with access to lower cost dispatch and generating capacity FERC has instituted rate care  of structures that facilitated more regional more accessible and more reliable grid.
To accomplish this FERC has instituted a federally-approved rate construct with specific emphasis on providing an adequate ROE a credit-worthy capital structure and the efficiency of a forward test year that will encourage companies to achieve the national public interest vision defined by congress.
ITC's unique business model is designed and positioned to achieve congress' intent to the fullest extent.
But that is not enough.
We also believe ITC can provide a more reliable standardized and better run grid that will ultimately lead to a lower overall delivered cost of energy in the mid-south enhanced economic standing and prospects for our communities and better opportunities for our employees to a single business unit transmission organization both in terms of their advancement and their ability to serve the transmission business.
It starts with ITC's independent -- independence and broader planning perspective.
Entergy's utilities plan for the reliability needs of all customers within the Entergy region but have limited ability to optimize those plans across regions.
The Entergy Utilities also identified transmission upgrades to facilitate low-cost energy delivery to our load they did the same for wholesale transmission customers that request transmission service or economic studies under our FERC Open Access Transmission Tariff.
However this structure typically results in economic upgrades being evaluated individually for different customers.
And as with the reliability planning we have limited ability to optimize such plans across regions.
Also because we own generation developers are less likely to share commercially-sensitive generation information for our planning studies.
Only ITC with its complete independence and non-market participant status can develop compressive plans that incorporate such critical economic information.
Only ITC can evaluate and optimize transmission planning needs for all customers those within and outside of the Entergy region in a broader more unified planning process that is viewed as independent and unbiased by market participants.
ITC is also better able to conduct transmission planning across the scenes of RTOs such as those between MISO the Southwest Power Pool SERC and TVA.
ITC's rate construct is the platforms for supporting the capital investments needed to build the transmission grid of the future.
ITC's independent and broader planning process will ensure ITC is able to identify the most efficient and cost-effective investments for that future.
This is particularly important in an RTO structure where a more robust transmission system leads to less congestion and lower production costs which benefit customers across regions.
Beyond independence in planning ITC's sole focus on building maintaining operating and owning transmission leads directly to operational excellence.
Each of the 3 companies that ITC has acquired has undergone targeted cost-effective investment and maintenance programs that led to significant improvements in transmission and system performance.
ITC's transmission reliability statistics on its mature systems are top-depth [ph]  file.
Better reliability means reduced congestion lowering production cost for customers.
In addition it translates to fewer outages and better power quality for our customers and in particular for our largest industrial customers that employ the most people in our communities.
Better service reduces the economic impact of outages for these customers and leads directly to a more competitive and growing economy in our region.
The Entergy operating companies participation in MISO will not achieve all of these benefits.
But as a super-regional independent transmission organization with broad experience in multiple markets ITC will.
Last week ITC received shareholder approval for the transaction.
We are now entering a key stage in the retail regulatory approval process.
Regulatory staffs and intervenors have began filing testimonies stating their positions on the record.
We anticipated the concerns reflected in their filings as part of the review and approval for such an important change in our business model.
These are the same issues that have been raised at commission meetings and the stakeholder engagement process during technical conferences and in other forms.
We look forward to discussing these concerns in the context of the many benefits of the ITC transaction and working to address them in a meaningful way.
Any proposal that would transform a significant part of the electricity business in the Midsouth is going to spur debate as it should and there is no doubt that the transaction itself is somewhat complicated.
We recognize that it is not an easy to point to quantifiable benefits as it is for the transition to MISO which is based on the transmission system that exists today.
However the benefits for our customers employees and communities are real.
They will be produced over time as they are the benefits that will be based on what the system can become in the future under the right structure.
They are worth the extra effort we're committed to the process and we're committed to this transaction.
The second strategic imperative is to optimize our organization through human capital management.
This imperative is a broad-based strategic effort to analyze how to achieve sustainable savings in all parts of the organization.
As the title implies cost savings are definitely a component here but it's not just about costs it's broader than that.
At its core this effort which is linked to the objectives of the other strategic imperatives it's about redesigning and reorganization the business for the long-term to a thoughtful and deliberate process considering all stakeholders.
We do expect that workforce reductions consistent with the redesign business organization will result.
I want to assure you that safety security reliability and compliance remain squarely in our focus and will not be compromised.
Detailed plans and goals are under development now.
I know you'll have questions about what all these means all I can commit to you today is that we'll provide more clarity around mid-year.
Maintaining our financial flexibility is another strategic imperative of the company.
At the end of the first quarter 2013 gross liquidity stood at a substantial $3.8 billion and all of our credit ratings were stable.
As we have always done we will work to maintain our solid financial footing even in light of the reduction in cash flow at EWC from low natural gas and power prices and markets which do not provide a fair market value for capacity due to poor market rules and in some cases face constant intervention by state regulators which suppresses the fair market value of these resources.
As we have discussed in the past investment grade ratings are important to us.
Investment grade ratings allow us to lower costs maintain access to capital in tough times and support our commercial activities and capital investments.
While we concurrently meet these objectives we need to pursue and execute on the strategic initiatives I am outlining today to be better positioned to provide the financial facility required to pursue more customer and owner-focused actions over and above current plans such as incremental infrastructure investment capital distributions and corporate strategic opportunities.
The fourth strategic imperative is to grow our Utility business.
The Utility is focused on being an -- a leading operator meeting our customer needs through thoughtful innovative rate making aligning efforts for customers regulators and owners and being recognized as a strategic partner for growing stronger communities.
We want to build off the region's rate advantage through economic development in each of our jurisdiction.
And as we've done before we will need to make future investments to better serve our customers and communities.
For example on the economic development front in the first quarter 2013 reached an agreement on a long-term contract with a new large-scale industrial facility a steel mill in Arkansas expected to begin construction later this year.
This project along with numerous other economic development projects announced in the last several months throughout our service territory represent significant potential benefit to our communities.
In aggregate benefits could include over $40 billion in new capital and more than 20 000 jobs created both direct and indirect with about 7 000 of those being direct.
Even if only a portion of these projects come to fruition they will have a significant positive impact for our communities.
We have teams in place who have refocused and reorganized to help attract and support these projects for the betterment of our region.
Continuing to develop and implement effective and efficient regulatory constructs is the fifth strategic imperative.
Simply put we want to find better ways to set rates and proactively build regulatory constructs that align prices and customer satisfaction with returns on new investment to eliminate some of the risks we're not compensated for provide certainty around the timing and level of recovery and keep our rates reasonable while we maintain our financial footing.
Our regulators have a long-standing appreciation for constructive policies that facilitate investments for customer benefit.
The approximately $2 billion in investments reflected in rates around the time they were acquired or placed in service last year is just one example.
Of course our regions have utilized from the rate plans for a long time since the mid-'90s in some jurisdictions including provisions for timely recovery of capacity costs.
To that end I know many of you know were watching the inquiry in Mississippi on ROE methodology.
In March the consultant hired by the staff of the Mississippi Public Service Commission issued its findings.
The final report did not recommend any changes to the ROE determination process at this time.
In another development supporting efficient regulatory constructs the Public Utility Commission of Texas founded its April 11 open meeting that they have the authority to approve a purchase power capacity writer and the capacity writer is in the public interest.
This matter is again on the agenda for discussion at today's open meeting.
Once approved the capacity writer combined with the already approved distribution and transmission writer mechanisms provide more efficient recovery mechanisms over time in addition to periodic rate cases.
While these mechanisms are important rate cases will always be a component of efficient and effective regulation is part and parcel of what any regulated cost of service-based utility company does.
There are standard processes and issues like ROE that are part of every rate case.
And as you know we have 4 rate cases underway now along with the outstanding FRP filings.
Additional details are provided in the appendices of today's investor news release and webcast slides.
The sixth strategic imperative relates to the EWC business.
Improved EWC results.
This one involves costs revenues and structure.
As you know near-term power prices in the Northeast are challenging and some of our EWC plants face financial challenges.
In the first quarter however due to regional natural gas limitations and cold weather daily spot power prices surged as high as $250 per megawatt hour in New England.
Longer-term we continue to have a constructive point of view on power prices against the current forward curve.
While we can't control what power prices do there are things in our EWC business we can control and that's where we're focused.
We are looking for ways to improve efficiency and productivity we will look at what we can reasonably do to maintain the viability of these plants while keeping safety and security as our top objectives at the same time we will continue to advocate for fair competitive and efficient markets in the region.
Improved efficiency and productivity in conjunction with efficient markets are critical to our business because we believe continued operation of our facilities brings benefit to all of our stakeholders.
I know many of you are well acquainted with the views of some leaders in New York it is important to point out that Entergy is aligned with virtually all of their stated policy objectives.
We all want clean air and actions taken to address the risks of climate change.
We all want good-paying jobs and investments to support our communities.
We all want reasonably priced and reliable power for customers.
We all want flexible infrastructure that can respond quickly to restore power following natural events like Superstorm Sandy last year.
And we all want generation diversity to support system reliability and not rely too heavily on any single type of generation consistent with New England's concerns about gas dependency.
We believe our nuclear plants are the best answer to meet all of those objectives over the long-term.
Taking Indian Point as an example as numerous studies have concluded replacing Indian Point will not be cheap new projects will result in higher rates for customers more volatile costs and more emissions but not better reliability.
We recognize some counter these facts with safety concerns particularly the proximity of Indian Point to New York City.
Our plants must be and are safe and secure a responsibility we hold to the highest degree.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is charged with that oversight.
Along with the actions taken by all nuclear operators in the United States the NRC regulatory oversight makes the U.S.
nuclear fleet among the safest most secure industrial complexes in the world.
It has always been our desire to work with local communities to educate them on the benefits our facilities provide consistent with the common objectives I just outlined.
As to safety it is also our desire to work with the communities we serve to assure them we are doing what we can to honor our commitment to the safety and security of those facilities just as we have in New York since the state of New York first sold us Indian Point 3 and Fitzpatrick more than 12 years ago as we did when we agreed to have the Independent Safety Evaluation performed at IPEC in 2008 the only plant in the country to voluntarily submit to an extensive blue ribbon audit and as we plan to continue in the future.
As the license renewal and other processes go on we believe these facts are important for all of our stakeholders to keep in mind.
And we remain willing to work closely with whomever we can to resolve any issues in a mutually agreeable way.
The last strategic imperative is more internal to how we operate as a company corporate alignment.
We are currently working toward aligning management practices and culture such that leaders throughout the organization are capable of inspiring high-performance acting as performance catalysts setting high expectations and helping the organization achieve them.
This strategic imperative facilitates achievement of all of the others.
In closing our long-term objective remains as always to create sustainable value for our owners our customers our employees and our communities.
These stakeholders are inextricably linked all share in the success of the company.
For owners we define value as top quartile total shareholder return.
For customers value is reasonable cost and safe and reliable products and services.
For employees value means an engaged diverse inclusive and safe work environment with opportunities for advancement enabling employees to seek ways to improve success for all stakeholders.
And for our communities we define value through a successful economic development philanthropy voluntarism and advocacy and by operating our business safely and in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.
We're pursuing these 7 strategic imperatives I just discussed to create value for all of these stakeholder groups.
For 2013 it is clear that entering MISO provides savings for customers.
In closing ITC provides incremental customer benefits beyond what MISO alone can produce.
Operating more efficiently through the human capital management strategic imperative facilitates systemwide investments benefiting our customers and the communities we operate in growing the utility and implementing efficient and effective regulatory constructs support keeping rates reasonable and attracting capital through our utilities for the long-term.
And improving EWC's financial standing is a necessity where we will make the right decisions knowing their implications to all stakeholders.
We have a unique opportunity today to choose create and pursue a path of the company and its stakeholders with clear focus on our goals.
And I can assure you that from the Board of Directors to the executive leadership team to all of us as employees we are prepared to seize the opportunities and make the sometimes tough decisions and implement the steps necessary to achieve success.
That is who Entergy has been it is who we are and it is who we will continue to be.
I'm sure you have lots of questions about events over the past quarter.
But before we get to that I'll turn the call over to Drew to cover quarterly results.
Drew? Thank you Leo.
And good morning everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover first quarter 2013 financial results cash performance for the quarter 2013 earnings guidance a status update on the efforts following the tragic accident at ANO and a few closing comments.
Now let's turn to the quarterly financial results.
Slide 2 summarizes first quarter 2013 results on an as-reported and operational basis.
Operational earnings per share were $0.50 higher compared to a year ago driven by top line growth at Utility and EWC results were slightly lower at Parent &amp; Other.
First quarter as-reported earnings in both periods included a special item for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed spinoff and merger of Entergy's Transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp.
Spending on our spin-merge initiative reduced earnings per share by $0.04 in both periods.
First quarter 2012 results included a special item for the Vermont Yankee impairment recorded at EWC which reduced earnings per share $1.26.
Slide 3 summarizes the major drivers by segment.
Starting with the Utility operational results were higher in 2013 due primarily to higher net revenue and lower income tax expense.
These items were partially offset by a higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense.
Utility net revenue increased due to both pricing and volume factors.
Pricing adjustments included regulatory actions for the approximately $2 billion in investment placed in service in 2012.
I'm referring to the Grand Gulf upgrade the Hinds and Hot Spring plant acquisitions and the Waterford 3's steam generator replacement.
All of these investments provide efficient low-cost clean energy for our utility customers.
Net revenue for the first quarter of this year included recovery of these major investments and the associated expenses.
Quarter-over-quarter retail sales also increased due to the effects of weather.
At EWC operational earnings increased $0.19 per share due largely to higher operational adjusted EBITDA.
Slide 4 summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of the current and prior-year periods.
The quarter-over-quarter increase of $50 million were due primarily to higher net revenue driven by higher energy and capacity prices for EWC's nuclear fleet.
Average revenue per megawatt hour for EWC's nuclear business was approximately $8 higher than last year.
For some time now we have talked with you about our bullish view of power prices.
Some of the factors in the recent power price movement were ones we anticipated in our point of view and some not.
In addition to support of late winter weather key fundamental drivers included robust industrial and generation gas demand and fewer operating gas drilling rigs leading to lower gas inventory levels and a roughly 25% improvement in Henry Hub price levels in the first quarter.
New England natural gas and power prices also increased from lower-than-expected LNG imports driving up delivered gas prices in that region.
Capacity pricing continued to improve in New York as the effects of FERC decisions on capacity mitigation and recent retirements played out.
Slide 5 summarizes our cash flow performance for the first quarter.
Operating cash flow was $544 million $57 million lower than the same period a year ago.
The main drivers of the overall decrease were: higher deferred fuel refund; and noncapital storm costs from Hurricane Isaac and the December 2012 Arkansas ice storm.
These decreases were partially offset by higher net revenue at EWC.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2013 earnings guidance range.
The as-reported guidance range was updated to reflect the special item recorded in first quarter 2013 noted earlier.
We will continue to update as-reported guidance as actual costs of the ITC transaction are incurred.
We also affirmed our operational guidance range of $4.60 to $5.40 per share.
I'd like to point out changes in a few drivers since we originally set guidance.
Last quarter we mentioned updated pension and post-retirement cost estimates which came in approximately $0.17 per share higher than the midpoint assumption.
For EWC we've seen increases in Northeast energy and capacity prices since guidance was initiated last fall.
The current projected overall average price for EWC Nuclear which includes both energy and capacity stand today in the range of about $50 per megawatt hour based on contracts and market prices at the end of March.
This compares to $47 per megawatt hour assumed in guidance partially offsetting with approximately 600 gigawatt hours of lower-than-expected nuclear production in first quarter of 2013.
The currently projected net effect of these price and volume variance is approximately $0.30 per share on a full year basis relative to the guidance midpoint.
On the Utility side weather was a negative $0.10 per share versus the normal weather assumed in guidance.
Other factors that can also affect results going forward include: utility sales especially during the high-demand summer months; outcomes of rate actions including formula rate plans in Mississippi and New Orleans; and non-fuel O&amp;M expense which can be -- which can vary depending on several factors.
Another uncertainty results from the tragic industrial accident at Arkansas Nuclear One on March 31 of this year.
The Unit 1 side of the turbine building incurred the majority of the damage Unit 2 was also affected but is expected to return to service in May.
For Unit 1 we are still early in the assessment process to develop cost estimates and schedules for repair of that unit.
Work to date has focused on ensuring that the structure is stable such that it is safe to assess what went wrong remove the debris and then create a detailed evaluation of what is required to repair the unit.
This work will provide the information necessary to develop cost estimates and schedules for a recovery.
At this time it is still too early to estimate the effects this accident could have on 2013 earnings guidance or the 3-year capital plan.
We expect to finalize the estimates in the coming weeks.
I want to assure you that we are pursuing all avenues at our disposal to recover damages resulting from this accident including insurance.
ANO is insured by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited or NEIL.
And Entergy Arkansas has initiated discussions with NEIL concerning coverage and we're to estimate the cost and timing to return Unit 1 to service; it's too early to tell where these discussions will end up.
We are working through these processes and will provide an update at the appropriate time.
In closing I'd like to highlight a few items.
First supporting our efforts to increase financial flexibility.
In March of this year Entergy and 4 of the utility operating company invoked extension provisions for their revolving credit facility.
The extensions provide an additional year of liquidity under the same terms and at a low transaction cost.
More than 99% of the total bank commitments under these facilities were extended and those commitments now expire in 2018.
Next NEIL talked about recent large-scale industrial development in our utility service territory.
Adding new large industrial customers have the obvious benefit of providing new revenue.
That new revenue includes the return on the capital required to service that customer and also contribute to existing fixed costs which helps our customers -- our current customers by spreading the cost of service over a larger customer base.
In addition the move to MISO gives us improved flexibility to serve that incremental load openly leading to even lower costs which is good for customers and all our stakeholders.
Finally for EWC we continue to see bullish fundamental trend in gas and power prices in both the near and long-term.
On looking ahead we'll note that formation of a Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone.
[indiscernible] occurs as expected by December 2014 should also provide material uplift to Indian Point revenues.
While we have a bullish price outlook there are many other factors that affect EWC's business.
We'll continue to work on the things we can control including improving efficiency and productivity while keeping safety and security as our top objective.
In all of our businesses we are committed to maintaining focus on the things that matter and delivering optimal value to all of our stakeholders.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith.
Research Division</strong> I was curious actually to get a sense -- first on the sense of forward New England prices here.
I know you realized a lot from the first quarter are just -- have gone forward here representing the upside resulting from the cash shortages is that the -- do you see that as being fairly characterized? Bill you want? Sure.
Well we certainly saw an uplift in those markets from both the real-time and the forward perspective.
So yes I think you're right Julien that that's been driving that.
And so that's had an impact on improved pricing for that area.
Research Division</strong> Great.
Secondly here just thinking more structurally.
As you think about the Indian Point asset how much upside -- how do you think about quantifying Lower Hudson Valley next year? When are you thinking that implementation realistically takes effect? And how do you think about the downside here of the contingency planning -- how do you kind of put that all together here in terms of cash flows [ph]? Let's take those 2 separately.
So as you think about the LHV zone we're cautiously optimistic that that's going to be put in place in the summer of '14.
Obviously there are some steps to follow through on and that's not finalized but we remain optimistic that will happen.
We see that as obviously providing an uplift in those capacity prices for that zone.
It's really hard to say but we're probably looking somewhere in the range of $2 to $4 KW month as it relates to that.
So we're bullish on that issue.
As it relates to the reliability contingency plan obviously we're engaged in that overall effort.
Our point of view quite honestly is that Indian Point remains the most cost-effective resource to meet the reliability needs for the state and especially for New York City.
We've seen a lot of projects that are being proposed.
Obviously we're looking at each of those.
A couple things you have to keep in mind all of those projects are going to be more expensive than the alternative of continued operation of Indian Point.
And majority of those projects are in the early phases so they have to be permitted they have to be licensed they have to be financed and they have to be constructed.
So we will continue to kind of work down that road but our point of view is the best option out there is Indian Point.
Research Division</strong> And kind of tying those 2 together is there an opportunity for a conversation with the state about Indian Point's future at any point? I know you've kind of alluded to that in the past is that on the table in any sense here? Well that -- I guess that's always on the table.
So we are always willing to engage in discussions that are mutually beneficial but obviously we couldn't -- can't comment on these specific discussions at this point in time.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then perhaps in the same vein of thinking -- looking at the Southeast portfolio rather.
So Louisiana there's been some discussion about a so-called trust structure.
I'll be curious what does that mean to you as you think about any potential middle points or consensus if you will? I mean is that at all on the table here in any sense? Theo do you want to take that? Sure Julien.
This is Theo Bunting.
As what it means to us if you read the context in which this was discussed it was really about jurisdictional concerns which obviously we knew going into this there'd be jurisdictional concerns.
So I mean we take this question much as we have all other questions around jurisdictional concerns and issues that have been raised in that context that resulted best from a procedural perspective was that it extended the discovery period but did not extend the overall in-date in terms of a decision from the Louisiana commission.
And as we go forward through that process we will obviously address any additional questions that may be raised as a result of this and respond accordingly.
But again it's not something that quite frankly we view as an issue that is dealt with any differently than all issues within the context of this proceeding.
We'll address it we'll answer the questions.
We believe the transactional structure is the right structure we believe it's the right party we believe it's the right time.
So we continue to appreciate the benefits and value associated with the transaction structure and obviously that's something we'll have to continue to work through and convey the benefits associated with that structure to all parties and ensure that they understand that.
We'll take our next question from Mr.
Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Just stepping back a little bit on the ITC transaction.
But -- when you guys announced the deal and there was an awful a long time between announcement and filing because you want to take the time to work with this different parties involved and you just wanted the states to understand you explained the merits of the deal and understand their concerns to trying find a good compromise before the filing process started.
We now look at kind of intervenor testimony coming in and there is kind of probably the expected oppositions still showing up and kind of the points being made.
Is there a bridge too far to cross from where their positions are relative to what you guys tried to educate them on beforehand? Or is this a posturing negotiation exercise? And if so what do you guys think of the key hinge points to resolve for these parties? Dan the -- I wouldn't characterize what we did in the process when we were reaching out to everybody after we announced as trying to find compromise.
We would characterize that was to get a good handle on their concerns and I think we did.
And as I pointed on in my script the kinds of things that we see in the testimony that has come in so far are the kinds of things that we would have anticipated and actually they're the kinds of things we've talked about with you and others over the course of that time.
So there really -- it really wasn't trying to find a compromise it was trying to make sure that we were listening to them and that we understood what they were going to be concerned about and as it turns out we got I think a pretty good handle on that.
We don't think it's a bridge too far obviously.
And the bottom line here is at the end of the day we believe that this transaction will provide lower costs of delivered energy to our customers and you can read that to mean lower rates for customers over time.
That's going to come about based on everything that I mentioned in the script as it relates to limiting congestion improving reliability and access to more generation that would have happened in the alternative.
We realize it's difficult to paint the picture here versus what we painted in MISO because MISO is based on a system that exists today.
If you think about all the types of issues we had to deal with when we were trying to prove up the case with MISO as it relates to the transmission system that exist  and the limitations around that the single path through which SPP was trying to argue we couldn't get to MISO.
All of those things were because the transmission system that exist today is what you are dealing with.
And while it has with it inherent problems that people can point to the transmission system that exists today and how that works it's easy to look at.
You can model it it's there.
The intent of the ITC transaction is to put in place a structure that will create a different transmission system.
The benefits that arise to the customers of Entergy and across the region are because a different transmission system will exist at the end of the day.
So it is a little bit more challenging to convince people because you can't run a model on today's transmission system with today's generation and come up with $1.4 billion of benefits.
But it's not impossible to see that future because that's exactly what congress and the FERC intended when they put in place the structure that brought about a company like ITC coming into existence.
So it's very easy to see where those benefits come from.
It's very easy to see that a new different constructed transmission system across regions planned a little bit differently by people who are not market participants who create the kinds of benefits that we talked about.
But the difficulty is that we can't point to the system that exists and run the models.
Well that's the whole point it's to get a new system.
So it's not a bridge too far it's just an education process that we have to go through it's a regulatory process we're going to have to go through.
I think what we've seen throughout the process is everyone is open to hearing what we have to say the technical conferences the stakeholder outreach all of that has gone very well.
Had great questions from everybody we've got testimony now and now as I said in my script begins the real process of figuring out how we'd bring it across the goal line but we do not think it's a bridge too far.
Research Division</strong> And I guess just going the converse if the deal didn't get done or didn't get approved how much of the benefits you would see from ITC the reliability the congestion those sorts of things would be gained or lost relative to ITC operating the entire systems? If we don't -- if ITC does not operate the system if they don't own the system then all of it the value that comes from true independence that interaction with market participants it's different than what we would do that planning across scenes which is different than what we would do that planning done by a as we would described a super-regional transmission organization it's just not going to happen.
The transmission system of the future that congress and the FERC envisioned when they put all of this in place isn't going to come about.
And so that's -- those are customer benefits that would not be realized.
But because the system is going to be planned in large -- it will be planned differently than we do it today under MISO.
But MISO doesn't own the transmission systems so they don't do the actual bottoms up planning.
And they're not in the same position to have the desire to create that cross-customer boundaries cross-regional boundaries cross-RTO schemes that ITC will.
We'll take our next question from Mr.
Stephen Byrd with MorningStar (sic) [Morgan Stanley].
Research Division</strong> I'm wondering if you could -- and I'm with Morgan Stanley.
Just wondered if you could give a quick update on the New York water quality process just in terms of things we should be looking out for -- from a process timeline point of view or anything else that's sort of going on on your water quality.
Sure.
Bill? Sure.
We got obviously 2 paths in that.
So we've got the actual certification docket this before the nice deck at this point in time.
And we expect a decision on that probably sometime in 2015 but also remember that we have the waiver argument in front of the NRC that we probably wouldn't get a ruling on that until all of the renewal litigation comes to a close so that would -- it's probably even beyond 2015.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Understood.
And just as a follow-up on the accident in Arkansas Nuclear One.
Is there an NRC process there that we should be thinking about or just as you go through the assessment process I know it's early days but just -- should we be thinking about a NRC process that plays into that review that you're doing? Steve I'm going to let Jeff Forbes our Chief Nuclear Officer answer that question.
I don't know that Jeff has had the opportunity to talk to you before but...
There is -- there has been engagement on the part of the NRC through the entire timeframe since the event happened.
They've had inspectors that have been on the ground reviewing the operator response and the actions that we've taken to address the event and I really don't see any risk moving forward with that.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Is there an NRC sort of review process that you need to go through in terms of coming forward with the proposed remediation or some sort of review before you're given the official approval to take whatever steps you want to take? Yes.
I wouldn't characterize it as we need their approval to restart.
But absolutely there are steps to -- when we review the data that we've compiled.
And our approach and strategy to ensure that there's no lasting effects on this when we review that with them.
We have conducted some of those reviews already.
Our next question will be taken from Scott Senchak with Decade Capital.
Just -- you mentioned earlier the importance of an investment grade rating.
And just looking at the slides and it looks like you're EBITDA is declining at the Nuclear business yet the capital requirements in that business are increasing.
So I'm just wondering do you see any required actions at this point to offset that decline in cash flow to maintain the investment grade rating? Drew? Well as Leo mentioned we've undertaken a number of different efforts to try and find ways to operate those plants more productively and efficiently going forward.
And so that's been sort of our key focus while we maintain safety and security of those plants.
So we're examining every process up there that we can right now to see if there's opportunities to sort of change those trends that you're talking about.
Then Scott I'll -- just from a historical standpoint.
Obviously we always have planned liquidity capital structure and all that.
Not at a single point estimate but with the idea that things could turn out better than we thought or worse than they thought et cetera things like the way our dividend policy has been sent out of the utility as opposed to total earnings and how we manage liquidity as I mentioned $3.8 billion of liquidity at the end of the first quarter.
So I think the bottom line is it's better when the prices are higher and the margins are bigger but we plan to be able to withstand when or not.
It doesn't mean we don't do anything about it when or not but that's kind of a historical perspective.
And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
I want to touch base with you on the System Agreement.
It's rather complicated and we've gotten expirations here coming up with Arkansas and I guess a little later with Mississippi and you had some discussion in Texas.
And I noticed the slide on SIRI and what-have-you.
I was just wondering how should we think about the expiration of the System Agreement in terms of this potential financial impact on theory or any -- or just in general how should we think about it? Theo do you want to take that? Sure Paul.
First I guess I'll start by saying I don't believe SIRI is a party to the System Agreement.
So from a SIRI perspective the elements of the System Agreement I would not expect to have any impact.
I mean obviously there is a SIRI-owned Grand Gulf and there is a life of unit purchase power arrangement out of Grand Gulf back to various operating companies.
But SIRI in and of itself is not a party to the System Agreement.
The exit of Arkansas as you said is contemplated at the end of 2013.
Mississippi I believe at the end of 2015.
And obviously as we've worked through the MISO process in Texas there is a condition around System Agreement notification as part of that process in Texas.
At this point in time the agreement it's contractual relationship among the companies and there is typically an 8-year notification period to exit.
And the agreement in and of itself has parameters and provisions.
It provides basically tariff schedules that sort of thing.
But I mean the companies will exit as the dates have been defined thus far.
We will continue to work through what is an efficient exit timeline as it relates to Texas as part of our commitment under the MISO change of control in Texas.
And we expect to move forward with that as we've said we would and the change-in-control conditions in Texas.
I guess what I'm trying to find out there is just in terms of as this System Agreement is unwound is there any potential that from a hole-fill perspective that we'll see a -- an impact on earnings one way or the other as these states begin to exit? Or is it set up that it's the last state that sort of will be the impact? I mean how should we think about -- is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of this rather complicated I mean it's just very difficult to follow.
I mean how if this expires -- as it expires should we think about any potential financial impact I guess is what I'm saying? Paul I mean I'm not -- I can't sit there and tell you if there is specific financial impacts that you see.
I mean obviously the agreement is a FERC-regulated document to various operating companies have provisions in place today that allows the costs associated -- that result from that agreement to be effectuated through the regulatory process.
Obviously as those costs go away they go away as you would see any other costs.
And so it is an agreement that again moves it -- kind of governs the inner -- these intercompany transactions.
And it's not an agreement per se that as companies exit that we would expect to see a detrimental impact on Entergy Corporation.
Okay.
So we shouldn't expect to see a negative -- that's fine I mean I just wanted to clarify that there's no -- we shouldn't see any significant EPS or earnings impact associated with this agreement.
This is Leo.
You shouldn't I mean it's really just a cost allocation.
I appreciate your understatement of " rather complicated " but it is -- it's really more of the way system costs are shared not -- and so it's not really anything where you should see an impact.
We'll take our next question from Paul Fremont.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I guess first question would be you talked earlier about not necessarily seeking compromise in the initial phases of getting the reaction of the intervenor parties.
Should we anticipate given the number of jurisdictions that this is more likely to go to a litigated order? Or how would you sort of describe the possibility of settlement in the ITC proceedings? Paul it's just like any regulatory process.
We're starting to see what everybody else is putting forward.
If there is room for settlement that's always more expeditious and sometimes more efficient.
So if there's a potential for that it's certainly something that we will pursue.
And so at this point I wouldn't say that you can make a call but it's more likely to go to litigation -- to a fully litigated proceeding or not.
We're just starting to see what everybody's position is but settling it might be the more efficient way to go about it.
And certainly that's something that saves time effort money on everybody's part.
If you can get that done you don't have to go through the whole process all the way to the end.
And I think quite often all parties have a desire to see that occur.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And I guess my second question has to do with -- I guess the NRC sort of talked about embrittlement sort of the initial finding using the old calculation.
And then they raised the option of using a different calculation which I guess is a voluntary calculation that the company can do for Palisades.
Have you been able to sort of go through the math of the revised calculations to see -- to get an indication of where Palisades would stand under the alternative test? Jeff? Yes.
First of all I'd say just to put this in proper light here.
This is not a new issue that you need to Palisade it's a generic issue for the industry where all pressurized water reactors or modern reactor vessel.
The public information I think has generated confusion on the risk here there's a sort of premature shutdown of Palisades in 2017.
I would just say that that's simply not the case.
Here's a very structural process as you referred to the alternate methodology and we're following that we will be doing inspections on the reactor vessel in the fall of this year and then folding that into our calculation.
And we -- our preliminary look at this would indicate that there's a very low -- extremely low probability of there being any meaningful technical issues with that process.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> So I mean based -- so in other words you're concluding that you would likely come out okay under the revised calculation based on what you know right now? Is that...
That's exactly right.
Yes that's exactly right.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And I guess the last question that I have is there seem to be a lot of regulatory proceedings in Louisiana.
If I take also the ITC proceeding I mean is just the size of the case load going to represent sort of difficulty in getting answers timely answers in all of the proceedings there in front of the Louisiana Commission? Bill? Paul it's -- that's -- some folks I mean regulatory proceedings is -- I mean we're a regulated industry that's what we do a regulated company.
I mean we have procedural schedules around the ITC transaction.
We're working with the staff as a matter of fact we had a I believe a schedule in conferences yesterday around the Louisiana rate case.
And I think we have a schedule to move forward relative to that case.
There are also specific timelines around the EGSL ELL rate cases in terms of getting a decision out of those cases.
So we don't believe that the workload is obviously as challenging to all parties involved.
And -- but thus far we've seen the willingness from parties to work through various cases and work through what we view as efficient timelines as it relates to getting decisions within a meaningful timeframe.
We'll take our last call from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> This is Neil Mehta stepping in for Michael.
After acquiring the Rhode Island gas plant a year or so ago how do you think about the size and scale on the merchant business? And whether from an asset perspective this is a business you'd rather seek to grow or reduce in the coming years? Well I'll start but I'll let Bill finish off.
I mean the intent is to improve the results of the business.
That can come from growing it that can come from a whole host of different structural things like we've talked about quite a bit in the past.
And as far as the Rhode Island plant addition to the fleet I think Neil Bill talked about this --  it doesn't necessarily add to the size of our fleet as much as it adds to the size of New England fleet.
Bill? Yes.
That's right.
It's we're able to use that asset not only to kind of hedge ourselves from our -- with the nuclear fleet that we've got but it's also provided some good opportunities especially with what we saw in the first quarter of this year to be able to capitalize on that market up there.
So I think Leo is right we've got to focus on kind of getting the portfolio to a position where it's -- it looks like it's sustainable from a long-term perspective and then we'd decide what the next steps strategically are whether to add to that portfolio or to potentially somebody else had -- would consider that portfolio.
I mean those are the options that we constantly look at.
I mean each and every day we're looking at how do we make it more efficient how do we make it more profitable and what are the options on the table to achieve that.
And that concludes today's conference call.
I would like to turn the conference back over to Paula Waters.
Thank you Tiffany and thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statements.
Our call was recorded and can be accessed on our website or by dialing (719) 457-0820 replay code 9708842.
The recording will be available as soon as practical after the transcript is filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission due to filing requirements associated with the proposed spinoff and merger of Entergy's Transmission business with ITC.
The telephone replay will be available through May 2 2013.
This concludes our call.
Thank you.
And that concludes today's conference call.
Thank you for your participation.
Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Teleconference.
Today's call is being recorded.
And at this time for introductions and opening comments I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] As part of today's conference call Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
With respect to the planned spin-merge transaction ITC filed a registration statement with the SEC registering the offer and sell of shares of ITC common stock to be issued to Entergy's shareholders in connection with proposed transaction and the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on February 25 2013.
ITC is expected to file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement and ITC shareholders are urged to read the prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and the post-effective amendment to the ITC registration statement when available for important information about Transco and the proposed transactions.
In addition on July 24 2013 our subsidiary Mid South TransCo LLC filed a registration statement with the SEC registering the offer and sell of Transco common units to be issued to Entergy's shareholders in connection with the proposed transaction.
This registration statement includes the prospectus of Transco related to the proposed transactions.
Entergy also will file a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the SEC related to a planned exchange of shares of Entergy common stock for the Transco common units.
Entergy's shareholders are urged to read the prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and the post-effective amendment to the ITC registration statement when available the Transco registration statement the tender offer statement on Schedule TO when available and any other relevant documents because they contain important information about ITC Transco and the proposed transaction.
These documents and other documents related to the proposed transaction when they're available can be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
The documents when available can also be obtained free of charge from Entergy upon written request.
Now I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Thanks Paula and good morning everyone.
Last quarter I laid out our roadmap for 2013 the 7 strategic imperatives we are focused on that will bring sustainable value for our owners our customers our employees and the communities we serve.
This morning I'll update you on progress on each imperative over the last 3 months.
As a reference the 7 strategic imperatives are listed on Slide 2 to the webcast presentation.
Starting with execute on MISO and ITC.
The targeted December 19 cut-over date for the Utility operating companies to join the Midcontinent Independent System Operator is approaching quickly.
Many operational and regulatory activities are ongoing in parallel to ensure a seamless transition.
Last month we received additional orders from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on certain key MISO-related issues.
We appreciate the FERC's timely action on these items.
Also in May on the implementation front we ran a simulation on processes situations and communications that employees will handle when MISO integration is complete.
Over 100 participants from Entergy MISO and ITC were involved over a 2-day period.
The exercise did highlight areas to work on; more importantly however it confirmed we are well on track for accomplishing what will be a step change in how we plan and operate our system.
Regarding the spinoff and merger of the transmission business with ITC in the second quarter we received key transaction approvals from the FERC and a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service confirming the tax-free nature of the transaction structure.
These items come in addition to the April 16 ITC shareholder approval I mentioned last quarter.
This brings us to the retail regulatory approvals.
We entered the final critical stages in the second quarter.
After careful consideration of the input from parties in all of the retail proceedings we and ITC offered a package of rate mitigation and other commitments including a total of $453 million in rate mitigation over the first 5 years across all jurisdictions as detailed on Slide 3 and a test to ensure customer benefits exceed ITC's high return on investment capital before rate mitigation ends.
These proposals align with -- align the realization of the benefits the transaction offers to customers and the rate effects resulting from ITC's higher cost of capital.
They transfer the risk of achieving the benefits of what we believe is a superior business model from the customers back to the companies.
We are not asking our regulators or our customers to make a bet on us.
We've been held accountable for delivering benefits preceding the cost of ITC ownership.
We strongly believe this transaction will yield a more reliable more efficient grid than joining MISO alone as I reviewed in detail last quarter.
The better grid benefits customers through fewer and shorter outages reduced congestion and line losses and greater access to lower-cost power.
The rate mitigation and other proposals commit us and ITC to delivering both performance and economic benefits that exceed the rate effects from ITC's higher cost of capital.
Rate mitigation will continue until they do.
These proposals were developed and offered jointly by us and ITC.
We are not in a position to discuss all of the details but I can offer a few points about how we and ITC plan to allocate the rate mitigation between the 2 of us.
The Entergy operating companies and ITC will share in the $387 million of the wholesale and retail billed credit component of rate mitigation in the first 5 years.
This is the part that is not attributable the forward test period.
The Entergy operating companies will bear 65% to 70% of this component.
ITC will bear the rest.
The Entergy operating components will fund the $40 million of mitigation associated with the forward test year in the first 3 years.
The balance of rate mitigation is comprised of net avoided costs.
For years 6 through 10 if rate mitigation is still required the Entergy operating companies and ITC will split those costs 50-50.
After 10 years the Entergy operating companies' obligation will be fixed at a modest amount and ITC will be responsible for any balance required.
Finally the Entergy operating companies' responsibility for rate mitigation will end after 20 years.
As I've said before we believe that the benefits for our customers employees and communities are real.
This rate mitigation proposals puts us and ITC on the hook to deliver them.
We do not shrink from being held accountable.
In the last 2 weeks we were encouraged by the Coalition of Cities in Texas.
After considering our commitments many of which were directly responsive to their concerns 14 cities to-date have passed resolutions in favor of the transaction.
The cities made a filing with the Public Utility Commission of Texas supporting a finding of public interest for the transaction provided that Entergy Texas and ITC meet certain conditions.
The PUCT will consider our application at their opening meeting next week on August 9.
We are hopeful that the benefits of the transaction including the rate mitigation plan combined with the city's resolution and the East Texas Electric Cooperative's recommended support will provide the Texas commission the basis it needs to approve our application.
We're in various stages in other jurisdictions.
Upcoming dates for filings and hearings are shown on Slide 4.
Based on current schedules decisions by all of our retail regulators are anticipated in the fall.
We believe in this transaction.
We are convinced it is the right approach and the facts and important public policy considerations support its approval by our regulators.
The next strategic imperative listed on Slide 2 is to optimize the organization through human capital management.
We refer to this effort internally as HCM.
In July we completed a comprehensive review of our organization design and processes.
This effort resulted in a new organization structure designed to provide optimal service to our stakeholders.
This process is a critical part of our ability to be successful at our goals of being more efficient continuing to control our costs and improving service levels.
Other opportunities to make our organization more flexible and adaptable to business changes are under consideration.
In the long run these changes will ensure our employees are in the right jobs have the right skills to be successful and the right tools and resources to meet the changing business needs.
Near term however workforce reductions are a difficult but necessary step.
We have identified approximately 800 positions throughout the company which we expect largely will be eliminated by year end.
In addition the organizational redesign effort will reduce contractor spending.
Difficult decisions like job reductions are sometimes the result of making long-term fundamental improvements in the way a company works.
The redesign process was led by a team of Entergy employees and had the full involvement and oversight of the entire executive leadership team.
In addition to realizing sustainable savings the teams are tasked with the goals of improving the way we work placing the right people with the right skills in the right roles.
The process is comprehensive thoughtful and focused on being fair and responsive to the needs of all of our stakeholders.
While we spent a lot of time on organizational design and process this past quarter we are evaluating additional opportunities to obtain savings including compensation and benefits procurement and non-employee operating expenses.
As a result of progress to date we have set a financial goal of $200 million to $250 million in savings to be implemented by the end of 2015 and fully realized by 2016.
I know you have more questions about these savings targets.
Drew will cover those details to the extent they are currently known.
As we continue this effort I want to reemphasize its safety security customer service reliability and compliance will never be compromised.
The third strategic imperative is to maintain financial flexibility.
Since I introduced this on last quarter's earnings call many of you have questioned what we mean by this one.
I want to be clear.
It means simply what it says: maintain financial flexibility.
Today we meet and expect to continue to meet our financial flexibility objectives.
Gross liquidity stood at a healthy $4.1 billion on June 30.
The credit ratings are stable at both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.
And our current financial outlook which extends through 2014 supports deploying capital and meeting our obligations without the need to issue traditional common equity.
Maintaining alternatives and headroom to avoid the damaging effects of dilution on our owners remains a central focus for the Board of Directors me and the rest of the executive leadership team.
This and the other strategic imperatives are simply about being better positioned to pursue more customer and owner-focused actions in the future over and above our current plans and commitments.
The next 2 strategic imperatives I will talk about are related.
Growing the Utility business such as through economic development and continuing to develop and implement productive regulatory constructs.
To be successful at one requires attention to the other.
For example effective regulatory constructs can provide utilities with the financial stability needed to make necessary investments and take actions to deliver reliable service to customers while keeping rates reasonable.
Low rates helps to keep existing businesses competitive and attract new investments to our region.
Higher growth can be cycled through the regulatory constructs to spread fixed cost over more volume.
Defining and pursuing this path is one of the keys to addressing the risks from so-called disruptive challenges faced by the utility industry.
I'm sure you noticed in Table 4 of today's investor news release quarterly weather-adjusted sales were down in all customer classes.
On the residential side increasing interest in energy efficiency and demand side management are contributing factors something we anticipate in setting 2013 expectations.
On the topic of energy efficiency New Orleans Arkansas and Texas the jurisdictions where programs are up and running we have cost recovery through a rider or through base rates as well as performance incentives in all 3 jurisdictions and recovery of loss contributions to fixed cost a limited form of decoupling in Arkansas and New Orleans.
Sluggish economic growth also contributed affecting all segments.
Industrial sales were disappointing once again this quarter.
Near-term factors such as inventory liquidations and slowing exports have reduced industrial electricity usage principally in the small- to mid-sized segments in Louisiana Arkansas and Mississippi.
While near-term challenges exist new industrial development activity is a bright spot in our future expectations beyond 2015.
Shortly after our last earnings call Entergy Gulf States Louisiana announced a long-term contract with Cameron LNG to supply an additional 200 megawatts for 10 to 30 years to their proposed LNG facility.
Construction is expected to begin next year.
This is just one example of the large pipeline of new capital investments for manufacturing and other economic development projects.
Our region has an attractive business climate led by its access to an abundance of natural resources reasonable cost of living including electricity rates tax and other business reforms enacted at the state and local levels and programs such as the compressive workforce training program in Louisiana.
To update statistics from April we now have over $50 billion in high-probability investment projects in various stages in our service territory.
This represents approximately 1 500 megawatts of load and more than 27 000 new jobs of which nearly 11 000 would be direct.
Obviously all of these projects may not happen.
We may not supply all of these projects and some may not be completed.
The point is this much in the pipeline illustrates the potential for growth of our customers and our communities.
I know I don't have to remind you that we have a number of regulatory proceedings underway in each jurisdiction including rate cases formula rate plan filings and storm recovery.
I will give you a brief update on major developments.
All the usual details are provided in our release and the webcast slides.
In Mississippi Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed a stipulation settlement to resolve the 2012 test year formula rate plan proceeding.
The stipulation called for a $22.3 million annual revenue increase.
The rate change provides funds necessary for increased reliability capacity for economic growth and the ability for flexible use of the power plants on the grid.
It is the first FRP increase in 4 years and even after Entergy Mississippi's rates will remain well below a number of other utilities in the Southeast and more than 10% below the national average.
The next Mississippi Public Service Commission meeting is scheduled for August 13.
If approved new rates would be effective beginning with September billings.
In May the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a settlement in a new proceeding relating to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's natural gas operations.
The settlement extended the gas rate stabilization plan for an additional 3-year term through the 2015 test year.
Return on equity midpoint was revised to 9.95% down from 10.5% and the plus-or-minus 50 basis points range was maintained.
This settlement resulted in a $678 000 rate increase for customers related to the 2012 test year.
In addition the LPSC order directed the company and staff to work towards the gas infrastructure investment rider.
The LPSC has a long-standing practice of using formula rate plans and riders for electric and natural gas utilities.
Requests for new 3-year formula rate plans are a component of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana rate cases filed earlier this year.
Regarding the rate cases the Entergy Louisiana companies have requested LPSC review of Administrative Law Judge's denial to consolidate the 2 rate cases.
As part of this request the companies are seeking a 60-day delay in the procedural schedules to allow all parties to explore framework for a more efficient review of the rate case requests and possible resolution and to set a new procedural schedule should the Louisiana Commission approve the motions to consolidate the 2 rate cases.
The consolidation matter is on tomorrow's LPSC business and executive meeting agenda.
Given these developments the ALJ and the Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana rate cases suspended the upcoming August deadlines for staff and intervener testimony there.
Riders are another construct our regulators have approved to support actions to benefit customers and the companies.
In early May the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved a new rule adding a purchase power capacity rider as another tool available for Texas utilities.
This rider will be available for Entergy Texas in the future.
However based on a review of the company's financial status and expectations Entergy Texas expects to file a base rate case in the third quarter.
Turning to the EWC business for the next strategic imperative listed on Slide 2 improving EWC results.
We have a number of options we are exploring.
On the revenue side forward energy prices declined in recent weeks but New York's rest-of-state capacity market continued to improve.
Second quarter spot auctions cleared near $4.40 per kilowatt-month roughly 60% higher than first quarter of this year and more than 2.5x higher than second quarter of last year.
Capacity market improvements were driven by the effects of successful mitigation any [ph] projects with contracts were reflected at fair prices in the auction and plant retirements in mothballings [ph].
In addition a new capacity zone for the Lower Hudson Valley remains on track to begin next summer subject to FERC approval.
The New York Independent System Operator identified the need for this new zone to address transmission deliverability issues and improve grid reliability.
The FERC decision is expected in the near-term.
Indian Point is located within this new zone where prices are expected to be higher than the rest-of-state market where it currently resides.
While we remain encouraged by the progress made related to the Lower Hudson Valley capacity pricing we remain concerned about some of the overall market design issues in New York and New England.
We are committed to continue to work towards promoting fair and competitive power markets in those regions.
From the cost efficiency perspective EWC completed a reorganization this month as part of this strategic imperative to improve results reducing costs going forward.
It was handled separately from the human capital management optimization effort due to the financial realities the business is facing.
Reorganization efforts in nuclear operations at the nuclear plants and nuclear headquarters are part of the overall HCM effort.
Additional ideas and opportunities for efficiency and productivity improvements at the plants are in various stages of review and implementation.
Regarding our nuclear operations we were pleased to announce the election of a new director in June Retired Admiral Kirkland Donald.
His tremendous experience including important positions in the Navy's nuclear program will enhance an already strong oversight by the Board of Directors.
Our actions and success in this final strategic imperative aligning corporate culture can best be judged by our results.
How well we execute on the other strategic imperatives requires alignment throughout our organization.
And successful execution requires a skilled and focused organization from top to bottom that is designed and managed to perform and achieve.
We recognize there are a lot of complexities to our company today.
That's inherent in the 7 strategic imperatives for 2013.
It's a busy year for us and we know it is for you too tracking the numerous filings regulatory decisions and management execution.
We are aiming for success in all of our strategic imperatives to support a step change in our customers' value proposition and that of the company.
Next year should provide a clear picture of who we are and where we are headed as a company.
Next year we plan to be part of MISO delivering benefits to our customers estimated at approximately $1.4 billion in the first decade upon integration into the MISO [indiscernible] market.
Next year we will not be working on the ITC transaction.
We remain firmly committed to this transaction because we believe the ownership of our Mid South transmission business will create the most value for all of our stakeholders held by ITC; for our customers and communities it will lead to lower delivered energy prices; for employees better job opportunities in a largely singularly focused business.
This represents incremental value over and above what the transmission brings to Entergy and its stakeholders today.
That said if the transaction does not close we will continue to operate efficiently to make economic and reliable investments to optimize toward achieving capital management imperative and to continue to seek out productive regulatory constructs and grow the business.
By early next year the pending rate cases in Arkansas and Louisiana will be resolved.
Rate cases are a basic part of our business.
We will have 2 others pending in Texas and New Orleans.
But the uncertainty caused by the number of outstanding cases and jurisdictions will be behind us.
Nevertheless we will continue to seek out productive regulatory constructs that reward efficient operations and facilitate access to capital on reasonable terms in order to maintain reasonable rates.
Next year we will be well into the implementation phases of our human capital management optimization efforts.
The new organization design will largely be in place.
This is a central component to the effort but not all of it.
Further development of other opportunities continues some of which will likely also be in implementation stages by then.
We are working to have better clarity before next year on the direction of the EWC business.
We are considering a number of avenues and options to adapt to the current business and market realities.
While we are working to strengthen the business financially we also know the plants are valuable to all stakeholders including to employees and communities for the direct and indirect jobs that they provide to customers and communities where the environmental grid reliability and fuel diversity benefits from their operation and to owners for the option for power price recovery they represent.
As we consider strategic alternatives for EWC all options are on the table.
Our focus today is on streamlining for 2014 and beyond for all stakeholders by aligning our organizational design functions and processes.
For our owners reducing complexity makes us an easier company to follow predict and value.
For employees redesigning our organization to be more efficient and aligning our corporate culture will create a more productive engaging work environment ultimately making it easier to execute.
These benefits help to maintain reasonable costs and safe reliable products and services for our customers as well as economic development philanthropy volunteerism and advocacy in our communities.
We understand uncertainty creates a discount and 2013 is the year for us to reduce some of that uncertainty.
One last item before I turn the call over to Drew.
Typically we would not mention to you the retirement of our human resources leader.
However in the current case it's different.
In September a long-term Entergy employee and even longer-term friend of mine Renae Conly will retire.
For the last couple of years Renae has been our HR leader and prior to that she led our largest jurisdiction for a decade through some of the most difficult times the company has faced for example in 2005 during Katrina and Rita.
Many of you however will recall that Renae was the driving force behind turning Entergy's Investor Relations group into the high-quality organization it is today.
And if you've been in the business as long as I have you probably remember her filling the Investor Relations roles at both Cinergy and before that PSI.
For those of who you that know her you realize how capable she is you know her tenacity her strength her intelligence and her kindness.
I know many of you listening that are investors will recall her many contributions and I hope you will feel free to contact her during the next month to wish her well.
And I know many more of you who are employees feel the same sadness as I that she is leaving us but also the tremendous happiness for her as she enters the next phase of her life.
All I can say is she will be greatly missed.
And now I'll turn it over to Drew.
Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover quarterly financial results and expectations for 2013 and beyond.
This will include a discussion on human capital management.
Now let's turn to the quarterly financial results.
Slide 5 summarizes second quarter 2013 results on an as-reported and operational basis.
Operational earnings per share were at $1.01 versus $2.11 a year ago.
Second quarter as-reported earnings in both periods included special items for expenses associated with human capital management in 2013 and the spin-merge of the transmission business of ITC in 2012 and 2013.
Turning to operational results Slide 6 summarizes the major drivers by business.
Utility operational earnings per share were lower in the second quarter 2013 due largely to a tax benefit and associated regulatory credit in the comparable 2012 period.
Together these 2 items provided a net benefit of approximately $0.44 in the second quarter of last year.
Excluding these items the quarter-over-quarter operational results declined approximately $0.15.
The overall decrease is attributable to the net effects of higher non-fuel O&amp;M expense and higher depreciation expense partially offset by higher net revenue.
A portion of the increased non-fuel O&amp;M and depreciation expenses as well as the increased net revenue reflect investments placed in service in 2012.
Previously identified higher benefit costs primarily from pension discount rates also contributed to the quarterly O&amp;M variance.
Second quarter 2013 net income also included approximately $7 million incremental pretax expense as a result of the ANO industrial act.
This amount reflected incremental non-fuel O&amp;M less than estimate recorded for expected insurance proceeds and reduced refueling outage amortization expense.
While on the topic of ANO I'd like to give a quick update.
First recovery efforts of -- for ANO have progressed well.
Unit 1 could return to service as early as August testing and recovery continue going well.
Second we've updated cost estimates for the assessment restoration debris removal and recovery efforts [ph] of the damaged property and equipment to be in the range of $95 million to $120 million.
This estimate does not include replacement energy and it may change the continued restoration activities.
Finally Entergy Arkansas recently filed a lawsuit in Arkansas State Court seeking to recover damages relating to the ANO event and is continuing to assess other options for recovering damages including insurance and other legal action.
Now turning back to the results for the quarter at the Utility.
Utility net revenue increased due to the prior period regulatory credit noted earlier and pricing factors.
As with first quarter of 2013 pricing adjustments included regulatory actions for major generation investments placed in service in 2012.
These investments benefit customers through improved operational efficiency and favorable environmental profile.
Utility retail sales volume on both an as-reported and a weather-adjusted basis declined quarter-over-quarter.
Leo reviewed certain sales drivers in his earlier remarks.
In setting 2013 guidance we anticipated declines in residential and commercial sales from energy efficiency and growth and industrial sales from expansions.
However year-to-date results have been below expectations for all segments especially in the industrial segment.
We expect better industrial performance over the balance of the year particularly in the fourth quarter as a large expansion is scheduled to start up.
Longer term we still see support for 1% to 1.25% sales growth.
At EWC operational earnings were $0.33 per share lower than the second quarter last year.
This period-over-period decline was due largely to the lower operational adjusted EBITDA drivers which I will review shortly.
EWC results also reflected higher decommissioning expense due to an item recorded in the second quarter of last year partially offset by lower income tax expense.
Slide 7 summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for second quarter 2013 and 2012.
The $66 million decrease was due primarily to the lower net revenue driven by decreased output from EWC's nuclear fleet.
The nuclear fleet had 26 additional outage days from both refueling and maintenance outages.
While second quarter day-ahead Northeast Energy prices were roughly 35% higher than prior year levels we saw a large decline in prices over the course of the quarter due in part to reversion of New England natural gas prices from high winter levels as well as weak supply and demand conditions in the broader natural gas market.
Including the impact of hedges average energy price for the quarter -- the current quarter on EWC's nuclear portfolio declined approximately $3 per megawatt output versus second quarter last year.
Leo had already reviewed the underlying drivers for the capacity markets.
I'll note that we continue to expect to see these constructive fundamentals going forward in New York with the new Lower Hudson Valley zone though regulatory intervention risk remains a risk.
Slide 8 summarizes our cash flow performance for the second quarter.
Operating cash flow was $572 million $15 million lower than the same period a year ago.
There were several drivers both positive and negative.
While the overall decrease was $15 million the variance by segment was significantly higher this is in large part due to intercompany tax payments.
Because Entergy filed a consolidated return income tax obligations are routinely settled between our legal entities as issues are resolved.
In the current quarter the intercompany activity was largely due to the tax settlement which we recorded in the fourth quarter last year related to the tax treatment of our utility decommissioning liabilities.
Ultimately timing of payments to the IRS will consider many factors including storm loss carry-backs utilization of NOLs and the taxable income of other entities in the consolidated tax group.
Slide 9 summarizes our 2013 operational earnings guidance of $4.60 to $5.40 per share.
I know you are familiar with the drivers so I will not repeat them today.
Operational guidance does not reflect the 2 special items I discussed earlier.
Now I'd like to turn to a discussion of drivers for 2014 and beyond as they are shaping up today.
Starting with HCM on Slide 10.
Human capital management is designed to create sustainable value for our 4 key stakeholders and will have a real lasting impact on Entergy by changing the way we work while reducing ongoing spending and maintaining or improving safety security and reliability.
As Leo noted total annualized savings from our HCM initiative will be in the range of $200 million to $250 million by 2016.
While execution of the initiatives and realization of the savings will occur over the next few years the bulk of the savings will be realized in 2014.
Savings realized at the Utility operating companies will be recognized appropriately in our regulatory filings when those savings and the cost to achieve are known and measured.
This process will vary by jurisdiction.
Estimated savings are primarily from the organizational redesign effort which will be largely completed by the end of this year.
The savings estimate also includes cost reductions from the other areas Leo discussed.
On a preliminary basis the total $200 million to $250 million savings goal is expected to be split approximately 80% to 90% non-fuel O&amp;M and the balance in capital spending and approximately 60% to 65% at the Utility and the balance largely at EWC.
In order to implement our HCM initiatives we expect to incur onetime costs to achieve in the range of $145 million to $185 million.
The majority of these costs will be incurred in 2013 and will be classified as a special item.
The level and timing of HCM savings are important in considering future O&amp;M levels.
Our future spending and earnings trends will be affected by other factors as well.
Slide 11 summarizes our non-fuel O&amp;M and refueling outage expenses over the past few years.
The 2013 base line of approximately $3.5 billion represents our current expectations excluding past and future costs associated with the HCM implementation and the ITC transaction.
Considering all these factors we expect a 3-year compound annual growth rate of the 2013 base of around 1.5% to 2.5% including HCM savings.
Growth rates can vary from year to year.
In addition to the level of HCM savings other factors to consider for future O&amp;M levels include the effects from the proposed ITC transaction variations in pension discount rates spending on initiatives such as energy efficiency inflationary pressures and incremental regulatory compliance costs.
Some of the factors driving changes in O&amp;M expense such as MISO costs energy efficiency costs and storm reserves have corresponding offsets in net revenue.
Looking ahead to 2014 Slide 12 summarizes preliminary major drivers to consider based on where we stand today.
For the Utility whether or not the spin-merge is completed is a key factor in 2014.
Excluding that transaction we are affirming our 5-year compound annual growth rate for Utility net income of around 6% through 2014.
In addition to HCM many initiatives underway now will determine our ability to deliver on this financial outlook.
Those include the outcomes of pending rate proceedings in Arkansas Mississippi and Louisiana and to a lesser degree the to-be-filed rate case in Texas.
The level of sales growth is also a factor to watch.
As I noted earlier 2013 sales to-date have been lower than expected.
However we still believe that over the longer term the annual retail sales growth of 1% to 1.25% is achievable even after factoring in energy efficiency and remaining capital [ph] management efforts.
As Leo explained our service territory has strong economic development activity signaling the potential for long-term growth.
Recent contracts combined with other major projects that our economic development teams are working on could have a significant impact.
Even with higher growth in the lower-priced industrial segment there is still incremental revenue and customer benefit from spreading fixed costs across higher volume.
For EWC energy and capacity markets are a major factor for the financial performance of that business.
The 2014 average revenue per megawatt hour for EWC's nuclear fleet is expected to decline approximately $2 per megawatt hour based on the June 30 forward markets.
Our 23% open energy position combined with market variability in certain hedge positions leads to a range of possible price outcomes as you can see in the price sensitivities outlined in Table 7.
Variations in nuclear plant outages both planned and unplanned can also affect EWC's earnings.
We now expect to have full refueling outages next year as a result of moving the Palisades refueling outage from fall of this year to early 2014 and our ability to identify and execute on opportunities to improve EWC results is important for that business.
This includes the O&amp;M factors I discussed earlier.
Income tax expense is also an item that seems to vary from year-to-year and by segment and we always have the potential for portfolio management activity.
Through all of this we are focused on managing the strategic imperatives and positioning ourselves to take advantage of any opportunities and facing new challenges that come our way while maintaining a firm commitment to deliver sustainable value to all our stakeholders.
And now the Entergy team is available for your questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.
I wanted to start with Slide 22 the illustrative adjusted EBITDA for EWC and how it ties into the Slide 12.
So you're showing a step down in EBITDA for the merchant business in '14 even though we have quite a considerable O&amp;M cuts and an unlikely pick up in capacity revenues in New York.
I know that there's a reduction in energy prices but I would still expect a bit of a stronger projected EBITDA for that business.
Yes.
Well the reality is is that we're still facing lower prices overall.
So as Drew suggested on a per-megawatt-hour basis we're seeing a reduction.
So while we're encouraged and we've seen some uplift from areas such as the Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone the fact is in a lot of the other markets specifically in the New England market we're not getting appropriate rents in terms of capacity prices.
So net-net you're correct.
We're still looking at a decline in total EBITDA for EWC for '14.
So that bar already fully incorporates cost-cutting and MISO's projections for the capacity price uplift? I don't believe that it includes all of the HCM efforts but it does reflect our point of view on current market conditions.
Okay.
And then on Slide 12 could you just explain a little bit what is the -- this potential portfolio management activities? What do you mean by those? Well as we look at that portfolio as Leo mentioned we consider all options and we do this on a regular basis.
So obviously we look at a hold-and-optimize scenario where we are taking the steps to reduce our costs and be as efficient as we can at each and every facility.
We also are -- explore market opportunities to determine if any asset or portfolio of assets would be better owned by another party.
And we also continually evaluate the potential for a shutdown of a facility.
So those are -- when we talk about options those are kind of the 3 different areas that we constantly look at and that's similar to what we've always done.
Okay.
But why is it mentioned under corporate and not under EWC? Well that's -- this is Leo Angie.
That's primarily given who kind of leads some of those efforts and they work in conjunction with the folks within the business units.
So the kind of people who do all that kind of activity primarily are driven out of the corporate organization so that's more just our organizational structure than anything else.
Okay.
I know I was supposed to ask only 2 questions but this last one is -- so we have the -- those projections of O&amp;M cuts targeted projections by 2016.
Can you explain to me the timing of this announcement vis-à-vis your pending rate cases and ITC transaction? I mean should it you think facilitate the ITC deal and your pending rate cases or I mean how will it be actually incorporated in your pending regulatory filings? I'll let Rod take that.
Rod West who's our Chief Administrative Officer all of the HCM effort is being directed under his organization.
So I'll let Rod take that.
And to be direct in answering your question the timing is not designed to facilitate or feed a regulatory point of view.
The timing of the HCM announcement really does reflect where the companies planning process has evolved to where we think we have a clear point of view on the savings and our confidence around being able to articulate what we think the bottom line impact would be.
And so as we began this process Leo I recall announced at EEI last year as we were formally beginning to publicly at least execute on our point of view around MISO and ITC we had perspectives around where the organization needed to be on a going-forward basis.
And as we evolved as the analysis evolved we felt more and more comfortable about when we'd be able to communicate.
So the timing it just reflects where we are.
[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Dan Eggers of Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Just following up on the cost-cutting program and kind of the numbers out there.
The overall savings are pretty significant relative to maybe what we've seen in...
Dan could you speak up? We're having trouble hearing you.
Research Division</strong> Sorry about that.
Just on the magnitude of cost savings could you share a little more color on where you guys expect to find the savings? When we've seen past M&amp;A transactions recently their savings have been in line or smaller than what you guys are talking about today.
So just kind of trying to bucket those a little better would be helpful I think.
Sure.
Rod? Sure.
Dan I think as we've discussed in prior conversations the -- what you know and what we call the HCM process has been centered around 4 work streams and both Drew and Leo alluded to them.
The first is the Oregon process and I think that one answers your question in terms of where we think the lion's share of at least what we've communicated today rest particularly as we look to what's meaningful in '13 going to '14.
Then you have comp and benefits procurement costs management and then the non-employee related operational expenses.
And so the lion's share of the savings order of magnitude 1/2 to 2/3 perhaps comes from our Oregon and process point of view.
Research Division</strong> And I guess just -- yes you guys reiterated the 6% earnings growth of the utilities.
That would then include the 2014 savings I guess? So was there a bit of a backfill on supporting that 6% growth or is that number actually biased higher because you'll have more savings in those numbers for next year? We're not considering it added to the 6% as I mentioned.
There could be some small benefits short term but ultimately we expect it to be recognized in filings when it's sort of known and measurable and within the regulatory process of the utility.
So we're not counting it really as incremental to the 6% target.
[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just to clarify on the ITC mitigation plan as proposed how would you envisage kind of those credits flowing through the financial statements or not? I mean how...
Drew? It's -- we're still looking at it.
Preliminarily we would expect it to be a part of -- it would be reflected in the net revenue.
But there's -- it could change with final orders that we ultimately get.
The only change that we would see would sort of be whether or not we would recognize a liability on the balance sheet for the first 5 years.
After that everything is contingent and so it clearly wouldn't be a balance sheet liability.
But at this point we expect it to flow through in net revenue.
Research Division</strong> Just flow through in net revenue as incurred basically? Correct.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then my second one.
On Page 12 under EWC you have this -- you mentioned depreciation as a driver for '14.
And then declining useful life of nuclear assets.
Can you clarify that latter part of that statement? Yes.
That was related to a potential change where currently we had accelerating depreciation as we get closer and closer to the end of life of the units and we may make a change where we flatten that out a little bit.
But that's -- I think that's the primary thing we're talking about there.
Research Division</strong> So that would be beneficial to earnings? Sorry just to make sure I...
No.
Well it would be beneficial to the end tail of the earnings.
It would be against earnings.
It would be harmful to earnings actually.
Research Division</strong> So it's a negative '14 driver? Yes.
Research Division</strong> And how -- is that included in the sort of EBITDA look that you put on the later slide? No no it's not.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Any sort of idea how much that might be or is it small? We don't have -- we're not -- we don't have that information right now.
But we'll give you additional details later.
And we'll go next to Andy Levi at Avon Capital.
Just on -- getting back to the cost savings.
So on the EWC side you have -- 35% to 40% of that segment would realize the cost savings.
And then as you said you have the EBITDA on that slide kind of coming down in '14.
So -- and then you kind of were kind of vague on whether ultimately the savings were going to be incorporated in '14.
So does that mean that we'll see them in '15 or -- I just kind of need some clarification.
And then I have one other quick follow-up.
I think Andy the clarification was is that the EBITDA number did not include HCM but we would anticipate there would be some...
In '14.
Yes the bulk of the segment we would expect to see for EWC in '14.
Okay.
But that slide does not include the savings from HCM? Correct.
Perfect.
Okay.
And then the other thing just moving on to ITC very quickly.
You have all these kind of rate mitigation things for the various states.
Can you give us a breakdown on how much of those savings are from let's say the System Agreement versus just kind of other savings? Can you repeat that question Andy? On the ITC Entergy deal there's savings from the System Agreements going away right? And then there's savings and so I'm just wondering what the breakdown of that is? So let's say -- I'm just throwing out a number.
Let's say in Louisiana it's $100 million of rate mitigation that's going to the customer.
What's kind of the breakdown of that? Andy are you referring -- this is Theo.
Are you referring to the avoided cost...
Yes exactly.
Column on Page 3 -- Slide 3? I don't know if it's on Page 3 but...
If you're referring to the Avoided Cost column it includes costs that would go away as a result of the transmission business going away.
And therefore there's no more MSS-2 transactions potentially between the various operating companies.
And also I think it also reflects maybe some impacts of zonal -- a change in pricing zone structures.
I don't have in front of me the various pieces and parts as it relates to those 2 components but I think we could follow up and get that to you.
And we'll go next to Greg Gordon at ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> So when I think about the HCM program in terms of its impact on your Utility businesses should I just think about this as being -- driving the ability for you guys to have a higher confidence level in earning at your authorized returns across the jurisdictions prospectively? I mean I think your guidance this year for instance presumes a significant level of under earnings.
So the HCM program would have 2 benefits: one it would reduce the necessity for rate increases but also keep your cost profile from creating regulatory [indiscernible].
Is that the right way to think about it? That's fair Greg.
I mean the major component is to become more efficient and through the efficiency we should end up with lower rates lower costs to our customers and have a better shot at earning the rate of return that we're allowed.
That's correct.
Research Division</strong> Right.
And if -- my one follow-up.
If you were to be ordered to implement the rate mitigation plans by establishing regulatory liabilities as opposed to running it through on a -- running it through the P&amp;L we should assume then that's an offset to rate base right that lowers your rate base? Is that right? Drew? Well we would only get to do that if we got a rate order a rate deferral.
I would think of it more as a regulatory asset that we would be able to realize over time on a one-time incurred costs.
Research Division</strong> Well if you had a regulatory liability right that would flow through as a contra-expense but you'd have a reduction in revenue.
So you'd wind up having sort of an upfront write-down and then flow the cash -- there would be a cash impact as you flowed the credit risk back [ph] but not an earning impact? Right? This is Theo.
I think what would happen if in fact you booked it upfront you would recognize the liability.
But the cost obviously would be recognized as an expense at the time you booked the liability if in fact that was the case.
As Drew said that's not what we're saying at this point in time would be the case.
If in fact you had a liability as part of a regulatory construct I would imagine that you're not likely to see that as it relates to regulatory rate setting going forward.
Research Division</strong> Great.
But you're -- so -- Okay so you think that the most likely outcome should these mitigation plans be approved is they'll flow through as you flow back the -- as they flow back the customers you'll incur the expense.
Your human -- your cost-cutting plans allow you to sort of plow through that and still close the gap between your current ROEs and your future authorized ROEs? As you state I mean the -- if in fact it happens as we see it or expect it today you would see the impacts of the rate mitigation flowing through currently as reduction to revenue which obviously would have a -- put downward pressure on ROEs.
You would also have as the regulatory processes move forward you would see the impacts of cost-cutting making their way through the regulatory process.
That could happen at various points in time.
Obviously as that happens as Leo mentioned earlier we would see rates being adjusted to reflect those changes in cost structure within the utility.
So for a period of time there is a potential that you could have offsets but again as you go forward and the regulatory process encompasses those rate reductions within the setting of rates the rates would be adjusted commensurate with that and those benefits would flow back to customers at that point in time.
And we'll go next to Steven Fleishman at Wolfe Research.
LLC</strong> Yes.
Two questions in 10 parts.
Just on the percent O&amp;M increase could you possibly breakout that 0.5% to 2.5% just for the EWC business? I don't have that in front of me right now Steve.
LLC</strong> Okay.
And then also on the target of 6% growth in 2014 if you achieve that in 2014 would you generally be earning your allowed returns in your regulatory jurisdictions overall? Or would you still be under-earning? Steve this is Theo.
Yes I believe -- if we achieve that we would -- I think we'd be -- I think yes.
I think the answer is yes we'd be pretty much be earning our allowed ROEs within the constructs of the jurisdictions.
LLC</strong> Okay.
So in theory that -- the cost-cutting is kind of helping you to get to earn it and will in the future at the utilities I guess.
One last just thing on the HCM.
The compensation benefits procurement that you mentioned are those included in the $200 million to $250 million or not? Steve this is Rod.
They are currently included.
I was just making the point earlier that the lion's share of that number was in the Oregon process but all 4 work streams are and will continue to contribute to our point of view on the 200 to 250.
We'll go next to Charles Fishman at MorningStar.
Research Division</strong> On the rate mitigation plan in year 6 when it's determined by the savings who is the arbitrator of that savings? Is it MISO? Is it the state commissions? Do you hire an independent consultant? In other words who is making that decision of what the savings are? Charles I think if you look at what has been filed as a part of that rate mitigation plan I think what we would -- what has been proposed is you would have an independent third-party that would be approved by some regulatory -- would be mutually agreed upon between ITC and some -- a regulatory body.
And unfortunately that is all the time that we have for questions today.
I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms.
Waters for any additional or closing remarks.
Thank you Anthony and thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statements.
Our call was recorded and can be accessed on our website or by dialing (719) 457-0820 replay code 4532989.
The recording will be available as soon as practical after the transcript is filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission due to filing requirements associated with proposed spin-merge transaction with ITC.
The telephone replay will be available through August 7.
This concludes our call.
Thank you.
And this does conclude today's presentation.
We thank everyone for their participation.
Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time for introductions and opening remarks I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] As part of today's conference call Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
With respect to the planned spin-merge transaction ITC filed a registration statement with the SEC registering the offer and sale of the shares of ITC common stock to be issued to Entergy's shareholders in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on February 25 2013.
ITC is expected to file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement.
In addition on July 24 2013 our subsidiary Mid South TransCo LLC filed a registration statement with the SEC registering the offer and sell of TransCo common units to be issued to Entergy's shareholders in connection with the proposed transaction.
This registration statement includes a prospectus of TransCo related to the proposed transaction.
Entergy also will file a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the SEC related to a planned exchange of shares of Entergy common stock for the TransCo common units.
Entergy's shareholders are urged to read the registration statements prospectuses and other documents referenced above when they are available and any other relevant documents because they contain important information about ITC TransCo and the proposed transactions.
These documents and other documents related to the proposed transactions when they are available can be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
The documents when available can also be obtained free of charge from Entergy upon written request.
Now I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Thanks Paula and good morning everyone.
I've been talking a lot lately about simplification.
In my remarks I will review major events of the past 3 months and how they relate to that objective.
As I know many of you are well aware especially given the number of other earnings calls scheduled this week the annual Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference is just around the corner.
As such we will focus the call today on updating you on the developments in the past 3 months and defer more strategic updates to the conference.
Starting with the proposed transaction to spinoff and merge the transmission business with ITC Holdings.
In September Entergy Texas and ITC refiled our application for transaction approval before the Public Utility Commission of Texas acting on the opportunity the commissioners gave us in the August 9 open reading.
The refiled application put in the record the enhanced rate mitigation plan that includes a benefits test and mitigation of 100% of the effects of the weighted average cost of capital for retail customers as well as other testimony quantifying the benefits to customers.
The Texas Commissioners agreed to hear the matter directly next month and briefing will end in December.
In Mississippi briefing concluded at the end of September and an order is now pending from the Commission.
In Louisiana a revised procedural schedule was set to conclude briefing on November 8.
In Arkansas and New Orleans we are working with the parties to come up with a new schedule.
Efforts were temporarily suspended during the quarter until the refiling in Texas was made.
And in Missouri an order is pending.
These schedules once set in each of the jurisdictions will provide more insight about the potential timeline for the transaction.
The revised closing date in 2014 has not been settled upon.
It will take at least 60 to 90 days after all regulatory approvals are received to close the transaction.
Clearly that puts any closing after December 31 after which our definitive agreement with ITC may be terminated by either party if the transaction has not been consummated.
We continue to believe this strategic imperative to execute on the ITC transaction will result in optimal value for all stakeholders.
While our operating companies are fully capable to own and operate the transmission system we know ITC's independence broader regional planning and sole focus will improve the reliability of the grid reduce congestion attract new generating resources other companies may be hesitant to build today and provide our transmission employees better opportunities for their future.
These benefits will ultimately lead to lower delivered energy cost for our customers and our communities promoting the economic good and helping to attract new businesses and industries to our region.
Under the proposed rate mitigation plan the risk of delivering on these economic and operational benefits rests with the Entergy operating company and ITC.
That said we know clarity on the future direction of our transmission system is needed for everyone and we are committed to that clarity by early next year at the latest.
Another key element in the simplification effort is to resolve ongoing rate proceedings in all of our retail jurisdictions.
Rate cases are a basic part of our business but we know the number of outstanding cases at one time creates uncertainty for all of you.
We received 2 orders in August one in Mississippi and one in New Orleans on formula rate plan filings.
On August 13 the Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved a stipulated settlement between staff and Entergy Mississippi resolving the 2012 test year FRP.
The settlement called for a $22.3 million rate adjustment to be implemented over 9 months starting in September.
The rate change the first in 4 years provides funds necessary for increased reliability and capacity for economic growth.
Also in August the City Council of New Orleans approved a black box settlement for Entergy New Orleans' 2011 test year FRP filing.
Under the approved settlement electric rates will decrease by $1.6 million relative to pre-October 2012 rates.
There was no change in gas rates.
This marks the fifth electric indoor gas rate decrease in the last 5 years.
The next step in New Orleans is likely a base rate case filing in mid-2014.
However we intend to discuss with the Council and their advisors' various rate-making alternatives to a full base rate case.
Last month's planned rate case filing was temporarily delayed to allow time for such alternatives to be explored and discussed.
Next in Arkansas.
A final decision in the Entergy Arkansas rate case is expected by year end from the Arkansas Public Service Commission.
Entergy Arkansas' most recent filing in the scenario of joining the Midcontinent Independent System Operator only reflected a $145 million base rate increase at a 10.4% ROE.
About $49 million of the increase in base rates is a transfer of revenue already being recovered through riders that will terminate.
Regarding pending rate cases before the Louisiana Public Service Commission we expect resolution by May of 2014.
As a reminder filings made in February requested base rate increases for the MISO-only scenario of $144 million for Entergy Louisiana and $24 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana both cases reflected a 10.4% ROE.
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana have agreed to delay testimony in both cases until later in November and early December respectively in order to continue to explore settlement options.
And in the case of Entergy Louisiana's Algiers rate case before the City Council the advisors will file testimony in November.
The final decision is expected by second quarter 2014.
Recall Entergy Louisiana requested a $13 million base rate increase to be implemented over 3 years in a 10.4% ROE.
This would be the first rate change in 12 years for the roughly 22 000 Entergy Louisiana customers located in the city of New Orleans and regulated by the city council.
This past quarter in Texas Entergy Texas filed a request for a $38.6 million base rate increase excluding new riders and a 10.4% ROE.
The test year in the 2013 rate case includes the majority of the third-party capacity cost disallowed in the 2011 rate case.
In addition through a special circumstances request in the fuel and purchase power reconciliation Entergy Texas is requesting recovery of approximately $21.5 million in capacity costs incurred from July 2011 through March 2013 not previously recovered in base rates.
If approved new rates go into effect as early as April of 2014.
Successfully clearing the decks of the majority of these rate cases by early next year is a key part of the simplification effort underway.
The System Agreement is another area of complexity for all of us.
Entergy Arkansas' participation will terminate in December on the same day we plan to begin operating in MISO followed by EMI's exit in November of 2015.
Earlier this month on October 18 Entergy Texas provided its notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement including filing it with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Prior to that on October 11 Entergy Services filed with FERC a change to the System Agreement exit notice provision to 60 months from 96 months.
FERC acceptance of the change in the notice period is required for it to become effective.
The FERC filing contemplates that the 60-month notice period will apply to ETI.
Similarly Entergy Texas' notice contemplates that it will be governed by the 60-month notice period or such other period as approved by FERC.
The proposed amendment in ETI's termination notice are without prejudice to continuing efforts among affected operating companies and their retail regulators the search for a consensual means of allowing ETI an early exit from the System Agreement which could be different from that proposed in the October 11 FERC filing.
Given that after the Entergy Texas exit there will be only the 3 Louisiana-based operating companies remaining it is reasonable to question whether the System Agreement should remain in place.
The interpretation of the System Agreement has been a constant source of litigation and complexity over the last 30 years.
Addressing this will simplify and eliminate the uncertainty it has created for us as well as all of you.
Turning to EWC.
Improving results is a strategic imperative we have discussed throughout the year.
Last quarter marks 2 steps in that ongoing effort.
First in August Entergy signed agreements to sell Entergy Solutions District Energy to Brookfield Infrastructure for approximately $130 million.
This is a small business you may not have even known we had.
The book value was approximately $100 million at September 30.
It provides chilled water and steam to customers in Houston and New Orleans a solid business with growth opportunities better suited in a larger portfolio that can capitalize on those opportunities for customers and our employees.
Closing is expected by the fourth quarter.
Also in August we announced the decision to close the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant at the end of its current operating cycle.
I can tell you the Board of Directors and the executive management team thoroughly reviewed all alternatives in coming to this difficult decision.
The employees at the plant operated at world-class levels.
In the decade of our ownership Vermont Yankee has averaged in the 92.4% capacity factor.
And it is currently in its fourth breaker-to-breaker run in that 10-year period.
While the plant had its opponents we know the closure will be devastating to the community including millions of dollars in taxes and other payments annually.
I want to personally thank all those who have stood by our side over the years.
Operating through fourth quarter next year allows the immensely talented dedicated and loyal Vermont Yankee workforce the best opportunity to plan their future.
It allows the communities to be begin planning for a future without Vermont Yankee as an operating asset and allows us to plan for an orderly shutdown and decommissioning process.
Shortly after announcing the decision to close VY we amended our certificate of public bid application to operate through December 31 2014.
The CPG decision is now pending before the Vermont Public Service Board.
Another area of uncertainty that is likely to continue for some time is the license renewal at Indian Point.
Unit 2 entered the period of extended operations at midnight on September 28 and continued operating under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's timely renewal provision.
Indian Point filed a timely application in 2007 and as such is authorized to continue operating while license renewal matters remain pending.
The same will be true for Unit 3 after December 2015 if license renewal is still pending at that time as we expect.
Given the number of issues and parties involved we currently project final resolution of Indian Point's license renewal application to take into 2018.
Indian Point continues to be a vital component of the region's power supply and we are committed to its continued and safe operation.
We continue to believe it meets all the requirements for a renewed operating license.
Today Indian Point is necessary to meet the reliability needs of the grid.
That was only further evidenced by FERC's approval of the new Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone in August.
We continue to expect implementation of that zone by April of next year.
Given the importance of Indian Point to New York we understand the need for contingency planning to take prudent utility practice.
We also agree with the state's priorities for grid reliability clean environment low-cost energy local economic prosperity and the critical importance of safety and security of the plant.
In our view Indian Point is the best answer to meet all of those needs.
We also know there are other opinions.
For those seeking Indian Point's early retirement we believe the best course of action is to find common resolution given the benefits the plant provides.
The final topic I wanted to cover this morning is an update on our strategic imperative to optimize through human capital management or what we call HCM.
After completing a redesign of our company in July efforts immediately returns to restaffing the organization to fit the required needs and skill sets.
We are over 2/3 of the way through this restaffing process and we'll complete it by year end.
This process is providing many employees opportunities to expand their knowledge skills and experience.
Overall however we expect to eliminate approximately 800 positions the majority by the end of the year.
Job reductions are a difficult but necessary result of a restructured design to make the long-term fundamental improvements needed for the business that support adapting to the changing needs of the industry maintaining reasonable rates at the utility to benefit the existing customers directly and indirectly by attracting new customers to the region and improving financial results at EWC for plants that are challenged in the current low-commodity price environment.
Next year we will be fully engaged in making the new organization vision a reality.
Given the progress to date we project savings both O&amp;M and capital in the $200 million range in 2014.
These savings estimates are incorporated in the 2014 earnings guidance initiated today the details of which we will review in a moment.
We remain on track to get the full run rate of $200 million to $250 million in savings by 2016 and the total estimated cost to achieve these savings remains in the $145 million to $185 million range.
In closing I know it's not news to any of you that we have a number of strategic imperatives underway enterprise-wide to address the challenges and opportunities facing us some of which have been under development for years like joining MISO an imperative I didn't go through in detail today.
Regarding MISO we believe we remain on track to begin operating in MISO on December 19 which we estimate will produce $1.4 billion in customer savings in the first decade.
These imperatives are the right thing to do.
Simply put they are geared to improve cash flows and reduce risk.
Success will benefit all stakeholders whose futures are linked.
For our owners resolution of the current initiatives will help to clarify the future state and earnings and cash return opportunities and potential for both the utility and EWC businesses reducing the range of uncertainty operating more efficiently reducing uncompensated risk and maintaining financial strength that supports continued safe secure and reliable electric and gas services at reasonable cost for our retail and wholesale customers.
Reliably delivered and reasonably priced electricity and gas helps to retain existing businesses and attracts new ones to our communities.
This is particularly true in our utility service territory today.
The difference in worldwide oil and natural gas prices as well as other regional advantages has led to a window of opportunity.
There is now a $65 billion-plus economic development pipeline of industrial projects in our 4-state region.
Helping to bring economic development to our Gulf Region creates a multiplier effect with benefits to our communities.
In addition financial strength enables us to continue to provide philanthropy volunteerism and advocacy in the communities we serve.
And for employees working for a solid company offers better financial security to them and their families facilitates a productive day-to-day work environment and offers career advancement opportunities.
That is the mission of Entergy to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders closing out strategic imperatives and simplifying our business to help us in that regard.
We've made some progress but more work is to be done.
And now I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
In my remarks today I will cover financial results for the quarter 2014 earnings guidance and other forward-looking financial updates starting with the quarterly financial results.
Slide 2 summarizes third quarter 2013 results on an as-reported and on operational basis.
Operational earnings per share were $2.41 versus $1.95 a year ago.
Third quarter as-reported earnings in both periods included special items for expenses associated with the decision to close Vermont Yankee and implementation of the human capital management imperative in 2013 as well as the spin-merge of the transmission business with ITC in both 2012 and 2013.
The decision to close Vermont Yankee in third quarter 2013 resulted in a noncash impairment of the carrying values of VY and related assets to the fair value of $62 million as well as other related charges including the effect of capital spending not chargeable to expense because of the plant's shortened life.
Going forward we'll continue to classify VY's capital spending as operating expense and it will be reported as part of the asset impairment and related charges line item.
And we will include this expense as well as any VY severance and retention expenses as special items this year and next.
Slide 3 summarizes operational earnings per share by business segment including major drivers of period-over-period variances.
Third quarter operational earnings per share were higher than the same quarter last year.
Results at Utility and Parent &amp; Other increased while EWC results declined.
Utility operational earnings were $2.04 per share which is higher than $1.72 earned in the third quarter of last year.
The overall increase was driven by higher net revenue and a lower effective income tax rate partially offset by higher nonfuel O&amp;M and higher depreciation expense.
Utility net revenue increased due to price and volume factors.
As we've noted in previous quarters pricing adjustments included regulatory actions for productive generation investments placed in service in 2012.
These investments benefit customers through improved operational efficiency in a favorable environmental profile.
On a weather-adjusted basis billed retail sales increased quarter-over-quarter.
The increase was driven by growth in the industrial customer class which was 2.7% higher than the same quarter a year ago.
Industrial sales increase was due primarily to growth in the chemicals and refining segments.
The majority of the increase in the chemicals segment was from chlor-alkali facilities as temporary weakness this past spring abated.
In part due to stronger global economic growth and in part due to demand pull from the improving real estate and auto sectors.
The refining segment also benefited from an increase in exports.
Residential and commercial sales results from the quarter reflect continued challenges from sluggish regional economic growth increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and demand side management programs.
Moving away from the top line the effective income tax rate for the utility was lower in the quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago.
In the current period we had favorable settlements from state income tax audits.
This resulted in the reversal of previously recorded expense.
Partially offsetting the overall utility operational earnings increase were higher nonfuel operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses.
A portion of these expenses reflected investments placed in service in 2012 and were offset in net revenues.
Other drivers contributed to the expense increases as well.
Detail is provided in the Utilities section in Appendix B of our earnings release.
Before I move to EWC I'll briefly discuss Parent &amp; Other which had an operational loss of $0.09 per share compared to a loss of $0.26 per share in the same quarter last year.
The quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by lower income tax expense due primarily to the planned utilization of Parent's net operating loss.
The EWC operational earnings were $0.46 per share lower than the $0.49 per share in the third quarter last year.
The period-over-period decline was due partly to lower operational adjusted EBITDA which I'll review shortly.
EWC results also reflected higher depreciation expense due to an item recorded in the prior period.
The overall earnings decrease was partially offset by a lower effective income tax rate on operational earnings.
EWC's effective income tax rate reflects a resolution of the tax issue in the third quarter.
Slide 4 summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of the current and prior year years.
The $20 million decrease was due primarily to higher nonfuel O&amp;M expense driven largely by increased pension expense.
EWC's net revenue was flat quarter-over-quarter.
The effects of higher-capacity pricing offset other factors including lower energy pricing.
Slide 5 summarizes our operating cash flow performance.
Operating cash flow was just under $1.1 billion for the quarter $52 million higher than the same period a year ago.
There were both positive and negative drivers.
One example on the positive side EAI received approximately $38 million from the Department of Energy for damages in our spent nuclear fuel disposal case.
The overall increase is partially offset by higher income tax payments.
Moving away from the quarterly results as part of today's release we are providing forward-looking financial updates.
Today's updates include 2014 operational earnings guidance our nonfuel O&amp;M outlook and the preliminary 3-year capital plan.
You should note that our forward-looking financial updates reflect our business as it stands today.
They do not reflect the proposed spinoff and merger with ITC which we continue to believe is in the best interest of all our stakeholders.
Slide 6 summarizes the 2014 operational earnings guidance.
We are initiating [ph] today at $4.60 to $5.40 per share.
I would like to highlight a few items beginning with the 2013 starting point.
Business segment guidance midpoints have been adjusted consistent with current indications.
The adjustment is net to 0 on a consolidated basis.
Now let's turn to 2014.
Utility's 2014 operational earnings guidance midpoint is $5.20 per share $0.60 higher than the 2013 guidance midpoint.
Utility's 2014 guidance midpoint is consistent with the previous 5-year financial outlook a 6% compound annual growth rate on net income from 2009 through 2014.
Among the drivers 2014 reflects significant progress on our human capital management imperative or HCM.
As Leo mentioned we are estimating total savings of approximately $200 million in 2014.
Our current 2014 estimate reflects approximately $180 million in O&amp;M savings with the balance going to capital.
The O&amp;M portion is expected to be realized approximately $125 million at Utility and approximately $55 million at EWC.
For the Utility HCM savings affects 2 line items in our guidance table.
Obviously it will reduce nonfuel O&amp;M and also reduces net revenue to the extent projected savings flow-through rates to benefit our customers.
Utility net revenue assumptions for 2014 also reflect the conclusion of current rate proceedings.
We currently have 5 base rate proceedings in process as well as other requests for riders to recover specific costs such as MISO expenses.
In addition Utility net revenue reflects approximately 1.9% retail sales growth driven largely by strong growth in the industrial customer class including planned expansions.
This reflects chlor-alkali and steel mill expansions expected to come online beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 and refinery expansion coming online in mid-2014.
Sales growth excluding the effects of industrial expansions is anticipated to be approximately 0.6% including our expectation of renewed growth in the residential class.
We talked about the significant economic development activities within our service area.
In fact just last week Entergy Gulf States Louisiana announced another contract to provide up to 30 megawatts of power for at least 10 years to Methanex's new methanol facility in Geismar.
Our 2014 guidance reflects industrial growth that is well within our line of sight.
Finally the Utility midpoint reflects an approximate 33% effective income tax rate in 2014.
But calculating the effective income tax rate at Utility note that the dividend income of the Utility preferred [ph] is nontaxable provided the structural reduction as illustrated in the 10-K.
Considering that effect we have an approximate 36% effective tax rate from expected income tax benefits included in our guidance.
Now let's turn to EWC.
EWC's 2014 operational earnings guidance midpoint is $0.85 per share which also reflects savings from HCM as I mentioned earlier.
EWC's net revenue includes an assumption from improved capacity pricing from a new Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone.
The guidance midpoint assumes up the [ph] relative to rest of state associated with the LHV capacity zone of approximately $3 per kW a month on an annualized basis.
The uplift assumption represents our risk-weighted point of view reflecting different scenarios that consider potential outcomes of various factors including reference unit technology demand curve's 0 crossing point vocational capacity requirements and the potential for various mitigation outcomes.
As you know it is not our practice to incorporate our point of view into our forward-looking disclosures.
However given the significance of the change the near-term timing of the implementation and the lack of market information we decided that it would be appropriate to incorporate a price fee for LHV.
We will revert to using forward markets prices in our forward-looking statements once the market more fully forms up.
Another key driver in EWC at 2014 guidance is depreciation expense which is approximately -- which is higher by approximately $0.25 per share and reflects a few considerations.
For Vermont Yankee the decision to shutdown the plant earlier than previously expected results in higher year-over-year depreciation for that plant of $0.04 per share in 2014.
Growing depreciable plant balances associated with capital investment also contributes to higher depreciation expense.
And finally one thing that may not have been on your radar we periodically conduct depreciation rate studies.
The year-over-year change reflects the estimated effects of revised depreciation rates based on a new depreciation rate study.
In 2014 this expected change accounts for approximately 2/3 of the total year-over-year change or about $0.17 per share.
We will continue -- and will continue in future years.
Keep in mind that the change in depreciation expenses does not affect EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA.
Before leaving this slide there are a few general assumptions I'd like to mention.
First the consolidated 2014 guidance reflects an approximate 36% effective income tax rate.
Next the 2014 midpoint also assumes the pension discount rate of 4.75% compared to 4.36% in 2013.
The final pension expense for 2014 will be based on interest rates market results and other assumptions that will not be available until early next year.
Finally Section 6 of our earnings release where we outline 2014 earnings guidance includes additional details on key assumptions as well as earnings sensitivities for 2014.
Today we're also updating our nonfuel O&amp;M outlook.
As you can see on Slide 7 we are estimating total operational nonfuel O&amp;M including refueling outage expense to be approximately $3.5 billion in 2013 and $3.35 billion for 2014.
These estimates include Vermont Yankee expense.
The amount of VY direct costs in the 2013 base year is approximately $145 million.
This 2014 estimate is consistent with our 2014 guidance midpoint and reflects HCM savings as we've previously discussed as well as other year-over-year changes.
The 3-year outlook indicates the compound annual growth rate of 0.5% to 2.5%.
As you think about the current 3-year view with VY ceasing operations by the end of 2014 the same range would apply to the 2013 base year but excluding VY direct costs from the base year.
Just a reminder the 0.5% to 2.5% is the 3-year CAGR.
Growth rates can vary from year-to-year.
Consistent with past practice we're also providing our preliminary 3-year 2014 through 2016 capital plan in Appendix E of the release.
You can see on Slide 8 the preliminary plan totals $6.8 billion roughly in line with the previous 3-year period.
In closing in a couple of weeks we'll be at the EEI Financial Conference and we'll have the opportunity to meet with many of you.
Needless to say we as a company and as an industry have many topics to cover.
While at EEI we'll review some of the topics we've discussed today.
Overall we expect that -- overall topics we expect to discuss are current initiatives such as ITC current regulatory dockets and rate cases and our Human Capital Management program.
Other subjects include: opportunities for our region's economic development pipeline investment opportunities at Utility efforts to improve EWC results and any other topics of interest.
We look forward to seeing you at EEI.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
[Operator Instructions] Will go first to Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> My first question is on the expense outlook.
So I know the guidance midpoint of $5 is unchanged from -- but the components have changed significantly.
And specifically the guidance midpoint at the beginning of the year for Parent &amp; Other was $0.50.
It's been rebased to $0.85 in the context of the current $5 guidance and rises to $1.05 next year.
Can you take us through the progression from $0.50 to $0.85 to $1.05? And then I have a follow-up.
I'll let Drew handle that Greg.
Well as you know the Parent &amp; Other is primarily comprised of interest expense and taxes.
And of course there's the affiliate preferred expenses in there as well.
So that's certainly contributing as that's grown.
The primary thing to think about is the tax piece of it.
And particularly as we move into 2014 we have historically used a weighted average sort of probability expectation of what our income tax is.
And we place that in the Parent at the a beginning of the year given the certainty of where it may ultimately shake out.
This year we have a better expectation of where it would probably land in that set Utility so we've highlighted some of those Utility income tax benefits that I discussed a minute ago.
That's the primary driver that you see kind of moving forward.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And my follow-up question is on the CapEx guidance.
It looks to me based on where your 2014 rate base is sort of going to end up based on looking at your rate case filing et cetera that the level of CapEx spending minus level of depreciation you played out in your slides that the rate base growth profile looks like it's more or less the same rate i.e.
around 6% that had it had been in the past.
So assuming consistent rate treatment wouldn't it be fair to assume that your earnings growth aspiration would be consistent with that through '16? You're jumping ahead of us a little bit on that Greg in terms of providing any kind of forward-looking outlook.
We will discuss a little bit of that when we get to EEI in terms of what the opportunities are going forward and where we see the Utility.
But right now we're not really prepared to go out beyond 2014.
Research Division</strong> I'm sorry.
But arithmetically the -- but arithmetically it looks like rate CapEx minus depreciation you're growing at about a 6% rate from '14 to '16 based on what you outlined is that fair? There are other components of rate base.
But the pieces you're looking at have -- but there's deferred taxes and other things that go into that calculation as well.
And I'm not trying to argue the math with you.
I apologize I'm just not prepared to go beyond 2014 right now.
Sorry about that Greg.
I appreciate the question though.
And we will now go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Just wanted to touch base on the depreciation study.
It sounded like quite a significant move in expected depreciation because of it.
And I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more as to what went into that? Yes.
Drew? So we use the group method of depreciation which means that from time to time we have to do an updated depreciation study to sort of reflect consistency with our actual experience.
And we alluded to it very briefly on our last call but didn't really give it a full discussion.
Ultimately the effect is to take away large increases that we would expect to see towards the end of life for the nuclear assets and sort of make the depreciation more ratable like you would expect under normal situations when you kind of go forward.
As you think about depreciation it's a zero-sum game.
By the time you get to the end of life on an asset you're going to have to depreciate all of it.
And so we're -- it's a little more ratable now with the new depreciation study.
It doesn't affect the cash flow at EWC.
Okay.
So it would suggest that the detriment in value that we'd be seeing later years is now being brought forward.
And so I guess near term the EPS would be more conservative in terms of the value of those plans is that the way to think of it? Yes on an EPS basis yes.
Not on EBITDA basis.
I think it would be about the same that we were seeing before.
Okay.
Then moving to Slide 18 on EBITDA basis you guys show it an increase now in 2014 versus 2013 versus last quarter.
And I was wondering you mentioned a few things on the slide one of which has to do with Vermont Yankee.
And I'm wondering whether or not the fuel expense is being reflected in EBITDA since the expense of I believe is being amortized.
That's number one.
And then number two what's leading to those changes? I mean I realize that there's a change in prices that would be benefit I guess.
If you could just elaborate sort of just give us a little bit more quantification or sensitivity to that.
I'll answer the first one and then I'll turn the second none over to Bill.
Fuel amortization is in the EBITDA number for Vermont Yankee.
So that's being reflected in Slide 18 the expense of fuel the noncash expense of fuel? Yes.
One thing to think about there is fuel is -- it's part of the write-down.
You write-down all of the assets at Vermont Yankee not just the actual plant itself.
So that includes part of the fuel so you see the fuel going down as well there.
Okay so that's benefiting EBITDA? Yes.
As it relates to the revenue side of things from a capacity perspective Drew mentioned the fact that we included Lower Hudson Valley in our projections for 2014 basically assuming a $3/kW-month increase over rest of state prices.
So that's included in our numbers here.
Would that change from last quarter? Yes.
I think last quarter -- we've typically been talking in a range of what we've expected.
And I think even in the last call there was a little bit of confusion in terms of what was actually included but in terms of how much was included over rest of state.
So this is much more specific that we're including the $3 per kW-month on an annualized basis for Lower Hudson Valley.
And I'll just add Paul that we have historically used market views and there wasn't a market view of Lower Hudson Valley so we didn't have it.
What we had was effectively a rest-of-state view in our last call.
So this time we are explicitly pointing out that we're putting a point of view in place for Lower Hudson Valley since there's no specific price target out there.
And we'll go back to a market view once that develops.
[Operator Instructions] We will now go to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> One question on VY when you made the announcement about the shutdown you said it was expected to be sort of a negligible contribution to 2013 at the bottom line.
So firstly I guess is that still the case? And then you give us an EBITDA number for '14 but with all these other moving parts can you kind of comment on how much is the actual depreciation associated with VY in '14? And what would your sort of net-income-type expectation be embedded in these numbers in '14? I'll let Drew answer it.
Obviously when you say negligible in 2013 certainly the -- on an operational basis it's negligible.
And on an as-reported basis I wouldn't necessarily call the parent negligible.
But...
Research Division</strong> I think you -- okay fair enough.
You said around breakeven operationally.
Operationally.
Operationally.
That's right.
And I think that's still the case.
I think it's a little better as we've pointed out because of like the fuel write-down.
And we're seeing a little bit of that in '14.
In '14 there's a little more EBITDA pickup because of the fact that we're not actually having a refueling outage in that particular year.
And so that's what's your -- that's part of the driver for the improvement in EBITDA in '14 which we wouldn't have other normal -- otherwise seen under normal operating conditions.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And you attributed $0.04 of the $0.25 depreciation delta to VY.
But can you give us the -- what is the number that refers to the delta? I don't have the exact depreciation for total VY in front of me but we can follow up with that offline.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just on one other topic if I may.
You have -- in the nonfuel O&amp;M outlook slide the reading that's rightly -- the 0.5% to 2.5% should be looked at net of the VY cost.
Firstly is that correct? Yes.
What we're trying to point out is you could take the $145 million of direct cost out of sort of our base year of 2013 and you could still apply the 0.5% to 2.5% compound annual growth rate to that.
And that would be sort of our revised view of where we might get to in 2016.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So if that holds though looking at the slide you have the step down in the underlying costs and then -- yet the CAGR is still up to 2.5% in '16.
I mean when you do the math on sort of what looks like a somewhat quantifiable step down in '14 to get to 2.5% growth CAGR sort of 3 years compound by '16 you'd had to have some pretty much higher percentages than that.
What kinds of things could drive you to the high end of that range I guess is my question? Or am I missing something on the map? Yes.
I think the big things are like pension expenses could be a big driver if we were to acquire to more assets within the Utility for example that certainly adds more O&amp;M expenses.
Those are the kinds of things that could drive it up if there are additional regulatory costs that's something that certainly grown outside of typical inflation growth rates over the last few years.
Those are the kinds of things that could push it up.
Given our current expectation 2.5% is probably on the -- it is on the high side obviously.
And I don't think under normal operating conditions we'd expect to get all the way back to 2.5%.
But those are the kinds of things that we're trying to account for given the uncertainty associated with where the portfolio may go or where pension expenses may go that kind of thing.
Research Division</strong> So it includes potential portfolio additions that presumably would up revenues associated with them at the high end? Yes 2.5% is accounting for the possibility of that.
That's not to say that that's what we are going out to do right now.
It's just within the range.
Research Division</strong> But in order for it to be that high would it require that relative -- I'm just not sure how significantly to take that as part of this answer.
I mean you were asking what could drive it up there that's what we were thinking about when we put a number out there like that.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And if I -- can you just share your with us sort of what you're trying to achieve what's your budget if not much else changed? Outside of the 0.5% to 2.5% growth area? I mean I think that's where we are generally targeting.
I mean that's what our -- we were trying to achieve the low end to that range an idea where we might even beat it.
But that is -- that's where we were comfortable putting out our guidance on '14 to '16 CAGR.
And we will now go to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Leo just catching on kind of your ends of the EWC comments you seem like you've made note of the idea of maybe trying to find some sort of settlement or resolution on any endpoint given the time horizons and license extension that sort of stuff.
Can maybe share some color on kind of what the tone or interest is on that and whether that's something you can realistically get done in sort of timely fashion? Really Dan all I'm trying to say is nothing different than what we've said before.
We really view Indian Point as a high quality asset very vital to the region.
And certainly provides the majority of the benefits that you would like to see in a power market in the economic environment.
It provides jobs.
It provides tax base.
It provides reliability to the grid.
It provides low-cost clean energy.
It provides all the things from a public policy standpoint that you would want.
And certainly we recognize that there are some folks who would like it to not operate to the end of its license life and that's certainly not the opinion that we have.
We think it's vital not only today but it will continue to be a vital part of that market for years to come.
We're just acknowledging that we know other people have a different point of view.
And if there's something there that could result in common ground where we can come up with as we've talked about before the certainty equivalent of value and glide path for the market we'd be willing to do it.
But there's no more emphasis on it than that.
It's just something we're willing to explore.
Research Division</strong> Okay got it.
And then on the ITC process with I guess the commissioner coming out on Friday and saying that voter decision couldn't presumably happen until January given their scheduling and how that corresponds to a year-end merger agreement date.
Would you guys need to formally extend the merger agreement to keep the deal going beyond December? Can you guys kind of function in an at-will basis pending more regulatory action? Technically the merger agreement allows either of us to terminate the transaction after December 31.
How we'll handle going beyond December 31 will be dependent on seeing the rest of the procedural schedule and seeing what comes out of Arkansas and New Orleans for example.
And then obviously something that ITC and us will have to consider.
But we're not prepared to go there at the moment.
Research Division</strong> But just -- from just a technical perspective would you guys need to sign a new agreement be to go beyond year-end 2013? Or could you guys function without an explicit time extension involved? Technically speaking we would not have to amend the agreement.
And we will go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Research Division</strong> First just with regards to the $5.20 at the regulated [indiscernible] next year how do you think about that within the context of your earned ROEs overall? I appreciate that you have pending rate cases et cetera.
But generally speaking would you say that you're earning your ROE in that $5.20? I suppose that was contemplated in your initial 6% growth CAGR I suppose.
I'll let Theo talk about what on each of the utilities to the extent that he can.
Julien it's Theo.
Actually I think the last comment you made probably speaks to the best way to describe and respond to your question.
I can't talk specifically on -- respond specifically to kind of what the assumption was.
But obviously the growth assumption in 2014 is consistent with obviously all of our other planning assumptions.
And as you look at 2014 and you see that our growth assumption hits the 6% you would expect that you're planning assumptions are aligned then that would produce something that would be relatively within the range of what we would expect to achieve from earned-ROE perspective as it relates to our allowed ROEs.
With that said the 2014 rate case is obviously -- don't go full -- don't go in effect at the beginning of the year in their entirety some go in effect later in the year.
And also there is some small element of regulatory lag.
Obviously since you file the cases from the time you file to the time rate's go into effect.
But obviously when you see the 6% growth aspiration in 2014 achieving that you would think -- you would also -- I think we'd also say that that moves us closer to our goal obviously which is to earn our allowed ROEs within the context of Utility.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then with regards to the latest update guidance.
I suppose in the preliminary release just that it was towards the midpoint now.
Could you talk of what changes occurred in the quarter that led to that decision? Specifically I suppose the district sale appears to be reflected in your adjusted EBITDA in '13.
Just perhaps the various walk if you will to get to that I suppose revised range within the '13 range.
We didn't change the range Julien you're just talking about the fact that we said we should be around the midpoint.
Research Division</strong> Yes.
Okay.
Drew I don't know...
Yes.
I don't think -- I think our suggestion before was that we weren't -- I think at the beginning of the year we were suggesting that we were at the lower end of the range.
And I think maybe the -- after the first quarter or the second quarter we said that we were no longer in the lower end of the range.
And for now we're just saying we're in the middle.
So I don't think from our perspective we've really moved a whole lot.
And so you're right the district energy sale is reflected in there it's about $0.15 and so that's part of the overall piece.
But as you may recall from the beginning of the year on January 1 we had about a $0.20 deficit on the pensions that we had to overcome because interest rates fell so far towards the end of last year.
And so I think that if you look across the businesses I think there's good -- there's gives and takes at EWC for example with higher pricing in the first half of the year on energy higher capacity pricing through the middle of the year but some reductions from a volume perspective.
And at the utility I think there has been a little bit of negative weather and that's offset a little bit lower growth -- well I shouldn't say it's offset it's a little -- there was a little bit lower growth than maybe we expected at the beginning of the year.
That's been offset by some tax benefits and some other things.
So I think actually -- and I'll probably mention that too on the tax side we guided you at the beginning of the year to about a 34% effective tax rate.
And while we expect to do a little bit better than that by the end of the year we expect it will to still be around that 34% effective tax rate range.
And we will take our last question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
LLC</strong> Just to -- I wanted to think a little bit about kind of the Utility net of parent drag.
When you look at the guidance for '14 I guess you have a $5.20 Utility $1.05 of parent drag that's about $4.15 net.
Is that a good clean base to think of kind of a future growth for the core Utility business? Drew you want to ...? You're asking about the Utility preferred elements of that Steve? LLC</strong> Not necessarily specifically.
let me ask the question this way.
So your 2013 initial guidance had $4.70 for the Utility $0.50 of parent drag so a net of $4.20.
So even though the Utility has gone up a lot it's been all kind of absorbed by in the '14 guidance a much bigger parent drag.
So I just want to kind of think about on a moving forward basis is this kind of a clean year for Utility net of parent from which to really think about growing the company? Yes.
I mean I think -- let me answer it this way.
I mean beyond 2014 we should have a pretty good view of our rate cases as Leo mentioned earlier and so that part will come into play.
The HCM program should be in full swing and we're going to try and get a better view of what we can do maybe even beyond HCM going forward we're beginning to work on that.
And a big piece of what the storyline is going to be beyond 2014 is going to be the possibilities with industrial growth at the Utility.
And whether or not our historical load growth can actually begin to move at a higher rate than what we've seen thanks to sort of the industrial renaissance.
And I think we're going to talk a little bit more about that at EEI when we get there.
That concludes today's question-and-answer session.
Ms.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded.
And at this time I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead ma'am.
Good morning.
Thank you for joining us.
We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions].
As part of today's conference call Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Thanks Paula and good morning everyone.
By any objective measure the first quarter of 2014 was extremely successful.
Our operating groups provided excellent service to our customers under extreme conditions.
Our commercial groups continued to provide growth opportunities while aggressively managing risks.
Our support functions continued to evaluate and implement more standardized lower cost end-to-end business support processes spanning multiple functions within the company.
We continued our mission to support our communities through assistance programs and our direct contributions and as a result we created value for all 4 stakeholder groups: our customers our owners our employees and our community.
This performance was achieved in both the Utility and at EWC and our financial performance followed suit.
Mainly operational earnings per share were more than double those of last year setting a new first quarter record and were driven by top line growth and lower costs.
This quarterly performance coupled with higher Northeast forward prices for the next 9 months led us to raise 2014 earnings guidance by more than 20%.
To be clear weather is not a strategy.
Colder-than-average temperatures for multiple stretches of time in the Northeast and in the 4-state Utility service territory had a significant impact but weather is just one part of what we think is a strong overall story.
We must perform day in and day out.
To that end our employees and equipment performed great this quarter.
Let me give you some highlights.
Starting with EWC our nuclear plant performed well overall to help serve increased power needs due to increased demand in New York and New England over the past 3 months.
To put this into perspective the weather in this region as measured by heating degree days was 11% colder than normal and 13% colder than last year.
As it relates to the EWC fleet operation the EWC nuclear plant's first quarter 2014 forced loss rate improved by nearly 60% with the shortest refueling outage ever at the Indian Point site at 24 days.
We also successfully completed a refueling outage at the Palisades plant which took a total of 56 days.
Our outage performance would have been better however.
It took 15 days longer to make necessary and proactive replacement of plant components following a planned inspection.
Another planned activity during the Palisades refueling outage was an inspection of the reactor vessel head in accordance with the revised NRC rule making on reactor vessel embrittlement.
The inspection went as planned and the results identified no discrepancies.
We have a high confidence that our analysis supports operations through the end of Palisades operating life and that the NRC will approve our submittal reflecting just that.
As it relates to our point of view on our hedging strategy while we certainly have been challenged with lower market prices over the recent past due to lower natural gas prices and market design concerns I believe we have been very consistent in communicating our bullish point of view related to the Northeast market.
This point of view was based on our model-supported views surrounding undervalued forward heat rates generally due to a lack of liquidity.
There are a few natural buyers and many more generators seeking to sell resulting in a larger discount than at time of delivery a robust winter demand picture for the Northeast region supporting natural gas prices and constrained Northeast infrastructure that offered asymmetric upside potential.
While the severity of cold seen this past winter and the degree of price upside that was realized exceeded our point of view we are directionally prepared to benefit from it due to our hedging practices.
A few years ago we made adjustments to our hedging strategy to incorporate more financial product in part to protect our hedge portfolio against certain risks that include operational and liquidity risks and also to position our portfolio for asymmetric upside exposure in a cost-effective manner and to allow for more upside consistent with our bullish point of view on power pricing.
It is important to note that we continue to remain bullish in the intermediate term as it relates to our point of view on Northeast gas and energy prices for the reasons I previously mentioned.
That said I'd like to talk about longer-term market issues.
We believe the Northeastern U.S.
energy market face several challenges which could lead to a repeat of the volatility experienced this past winter.
Market design problems do not support the continued operation of critical generating resources in the region resulting in declining reserve margins over time a lack of fuel diversity in the region and an overreliance on natural gas.
If we continue to see the Northeast power markets drive what should be economic units to retire prematurely and not fairly reward generators for the attributes they provide including fuel supply diversity and reliability as well as environmental benefit what was a volatile outlier this winter and last could become a recurring situation.
In addition this year's winter exposed serious infrastructure limitations -- limitation which constrained the operation of some resources during periods of high demand.
For example there is simply not enough natural gas pipeline capacity in New England to serve both heating demand and natural gas by power plants during extreme cold.
Concern over this lack of pipeline and delivery systems in New England is shared by the Obama administration.
Earlier this week the U.S.
Secretary of Energy met with 150 state officials and industry executives environmentalists and others in New England as part of a federal review of energy issues ordered by the President.
The region is evaluating the situation but any solution whether new pipelines or gas by wire that is new transmission lines into New England from Canada or other places will be difficult expensive and will take a considerable amount of time.
Whether any of these options deliver the most reasonably priced power to consumers or meets regional environmental price stability economic growth and other objectives is unclear.
We believe the markets today are not structured to value these attributes.
We are committed to constructively addressing these market issues with regulators and other stakeholders and we are seeing signs of progress.
For example the downward sloping demand curve in New England's next forward capacity market is a start.
A sloping demand curve is important because it values all resources not just at the point of resource inadequacy.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered ISO New England to have this in place by the next forward capacity auction.
However keep in mind that price signal won't be realized until mid-2018.
And making exceptions for renewables as was proposed by ISO New England in April filing with FERC further undermined the efficient operation of the market.
Poor market design and continued interference with market mechanisms is what has led ISO New England to the place they are today the declining market margin inadequate research diversity and the risk of additional retirements in the region.
We will continue to constructively work with the stakeholders in New England to develop proposed market design changes.
In New York we have also seen progress as it relates to improved market design yet future challenges do remain.
To give the market proper pricing signals for locational capacity needs the Lower Hudson Valley zone approved by FERC will become effective next week.
The summer strip auction covering the months of May through October cleared at nearly $10 a kilowatt month.
This summer and May monthly auctions cleared at similar levels.
All in all these pricing data points demonstrate the need for capacity to supply customers in the constrained zone of New York.
To summarize these operational hedging and market advocacy activities of the past 3 months are focused on advancing our EWC strategy of preserving optionality and managing risk.
What has transpired illustrates ways the portfolio has option value and we have the ability to capture that value book now into the immediate future given the realities of this market.
Realizing that requires the plans being online both now through solid operations and in the future including the license renewal of [indiscernible] a balanced hedging strategy takes us towards our point of view but maintaining adequate downside protection and continued emphasis on changes in market design so that the reliability fuel diversity and environmental attributes provided by these units are both valued and compensated.
The Utility also performed well this quarter.
Our performance in storm restoration illustrates our capability and dedication when more than 13 000 employees contractors and mutual assistant workers responded to 4 ice storms from January through March.
Our employees are not only storm tested.
They are leaders in storm restoration and proactively keeping our customers informed during outages as recognized by J.D.
Power and Associates.
It was unprecedented when our utilities were the top 5 performers in proactive outage communications in J.D.
Power's 2013 Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study but we did it again as reported earlier this month in the 2014 study.
Also exemplifying our strong performance is the fact we earned yet again the Edison Electric Institute's storm Recovery and Assistance Awards for 2013.
Entergy has earned EEI's Emergency Recovery Award or Emergency Assistance Award every year for 16 consecutive years the only utility in the country to do so.
Also during the quarter our weather-adjusted sales growth was solid for our residential commercial and industrial segments.
For industrial customers expansions make up 1/3 of the growth this quarter.
This is not new.
In fact in the last 5 years since 2008 we have seen over 50 expansions by our current industrial customers as well as a couple of new major facilities.
Expansions during this time have driven an average industrial growth rate of nearly 2% per year.
The factors driving the economics of these historical expansion projects are similar to the factors we are projecting for new facilities in the coming years namely favorable domestic input energy prices against competitors in other countries infrastructure and regional benefits of consolidating and expanding in the Gulf South versus other parts of the country and supportive communities and constructive regulation.
The next phase in this regional industrial expansion has the potential for a significantly greater impact.
That's what we have been analyzing and preparing for this past year.
We've identified around $65 billion of high potential projects through 2019.
Noteworthy developments include a ruling on the air permit for the new Big River steel plant in Arkansas that is expected tomorrow.
If approved construction could start this summer.
In Louisiana an expansion of an existing steel mill began operation late last year and ramped up faster than expected this quarter.
In Mississippi teams worked with local communities to qualify 4 large industrial sites in 4 counties.
We expect to complete this process by November 2014.
Finally in Texas there was a groundbreaking to build the largest methanol production plant in the United States at a cost of approximately $1 billion which will bring in approximately 3 000 construction jobs and approximately 240 permanent jobs in the Beaumont area of our service territory.
Some of these projects we have contracts to serve others we are working on.
The bottom line is for us to help bring these projects home to our community.
The economic impact from the direct jobs ancillary companies and services new customers taxes and other resulting effects will benefit our business in the long term even as it benefits our communities customers and employees in the short term.
That is why economic development is central to our Utility strategy and we are looking into all areas to support and promote it.
One example of how we can support economic development is in the regulatory arena.
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana notified the Louisiana Public Service Commission this week that they will file a study in June containing a preliminary analysis of the business combination of the 2 companies.
This is a study we agreed to complete in connection with the resolution of the company's rate cases.
While we expect to learn more once we complete the study we anticipate that a larger company would be more nimble and efficient benefiting our 4 key stakeholders and simplifying the regulatory process for our regulators.
The combination could improve financial flexibility helping to finance the Utility's investment required to serve new industrial customers and supporting the state in bringing to Louisiana jobs and regional economic growth opportunities.
We continue to make progress on other regulatory agenda items in support of our Utility strategy.
In Texas earlier this month we filed a unanimous settlement in a rate case allowing for an $18.5 million base rate increase and 2 limited term riders to recover cost.
The return on equity of 9.8% reflected in the settlement matches what was authorized in the 2011 2012 rate cases.
The settlement also sets baselines for future use of the purchased capacity cost distribution and transmission riders.
The unanimous settlement is now before the Public Utility Commission of Texas and a decision is expected next month.
In Arkansas the commission took up our rehearing request for the 2013 rate case including our request to review the low authorized ROE and a financing formula for construction projects that do not fully compensate Entergy Arkansas for its cost.
The next steps are up to the Arkansas Public Service Commission but we are cautiously optimistic that we are able to explain our concerns about how the prior order hinders our shared objective of economic growth in the state.
Again to take a step back from the details this quarter our utilities performed when needed most.
We responded to numerous storms while maintaining safe and reliable service.
We saw strong retail sales growth including industrial sales and we continue to make progress in our regulatory jurisdictions for constructive outcome that align the interest of our 4 stakeholders.
It should not surprise you that industrial expansion in the Gulf region is one of the topics we will explore on June 5 at our Analyst Day.
While we are actively preparing for our event I wanted to give you a preview.
On a macro basis there are 2 things trending in our favor; the industrial renaissance that is currently impacting our service territory and the market price of power.
We plan to explore with you why we are so optimistic about both of these market conditions and why they can coexist.
We can position ourselves to succeed when we recognize opportunities such as these.
We are not simply passive participants.
We see that as a duty and a privilege to have a role in bringing these benefits home to our stakeholders.
So the second broad area we plan to cover on June 5 is what we are doing to capture these market opportunities.
Our goal is to give a better picture of our strategy and levers that not only meet but exceed your expectations.
We know that will be a tall order and it certainly won't all be solved in one day.
But rest assured I and the entire executive leadership team are committed to explaining our strategy and why we believe it can be successful to providing a clear roadmap of where we're headed and then most importantly to continue to mobilize the entire organization to deliver on our commitments.
The first quarter is a sample of what we know is possible.
With that I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
Today I will review the financial results for the quarter as well as our updated 2014 operational earnings guidance.
Starting with Slide 2 our first quarter results for the current and prior years are shown on as-reported and an operational basis.
Operational earnings per share were a robust $2.29 for the first quarter of 2014 compared to $0.94 in 2013.
The significant increase was due largely to higher net revenue from EWC's Northeast nuclear fleet while Utility net revenue was higher as well.
Operational earnings excluded special items from the decision to close Vermont Yankee and HCM implementation.
Earnings and operational results on Slide 3.
Starting with Utility operational earnings per share were $1.13.
This is $0.40 higher than the $0.73 earned in the first quarter last year and there are a few key drivers that I'll highlight starting with net revenue.
As reported in the pre-release weather was positive in the current period compared to the mild temperatures in the fourth -- first quarter of last year.
In addition positive weather-adjusted sales growth contributed about $0.05.
On a weather-adjusted basis billed sales were 2.1% higher than the comparable period.
The increase was consistent across the residential commercial and industrial customer classes with industrial sales growth for the quarter at 2.5%.
Industrial gains were broadly spread across multiple segments.
The net effect of regulatory actions was also a factor for Utility net revenue but was largely offset by other line items and therefore contributed only about $0.03 to the quarterly earnings increase.
The net revenue increases were partially offset by an unfavorable unbilled revenue variance of approximately $0.09 quarter-over-quarter.
Besides net revenue nonfuel O&amp;M was also favorable quarter-over-quarter reflecting lower pension expense from a higher discount rate as well as last year's cost reduction effort which resulted in fewer employees and changes in benefit plan.
When taking into account expense increases that have designated net revenue recoveries such as storm reserves and energy efficiency program cost the quarter-over-quarter improvement was about $0.10.
Now moving on to EWC.
EWC's operational earnings of $1.39 per share in the first quarter of this year was higher than the $0.46 earned in the prior period.
EWC results included an income tax benefit which resulted from a change in New York State tax law.
The change resulted in a onetime reduction in deferred taxes of approximately $21 million.
Turning to EWC EBITDA drivers on Slide 4.
The $261 million increase was driven by higher realized wholesale energy prices for EWC's Northeast nuclear assets.
The average realized price for EWC's nuclear fleet was $89 per megawatt hour.
Leo mentioned that our hedging strategy was part of the story for EWC's earnings this quarter.
To add to that I will simply remind you that we maintain upside in many of our contracted hedges through a protective call to address operational and liquidity risks in high-price environments like we experienced in the first quarter.
This discipline actually reduces our overall risk profile.
We view Slide 5 for some time to illustrate how our contracting strategy provides asymmetric upside opportunity.
Note the positive slope to the line and higher prices illustrating the protective call strategy.
Also included in net revenue is certain mark-to-market activity which includes a range of items.
In the first quarter of this year mark-to-market activity netted to approximately $21 million pretax which includes the -- which included the positive turnaround of the $45 million pretax mark in the fourth quarter of 2013.
A natural question is whether or not this quarter could repeat next year and beyond.
As Leo discussed we analyze and prepare for longer-term fundamental changes.
We don't rely on weather to achieve our goals but we do remain bullish on our point of view of energy pricing in the Northeast market.
We witnessed higher volatility in these markets in the last 2 winters and believe this will continue in the foreseeable future due to constrained Northeast infrastructure.
Looking forward to next year should the same conditions repeat we would expect to be able to again capitalize on the optionality of our portfolio.
However note that we will not have the benefit of a largely unhedged Vermont Yankee unit as we did this winter and our revenue opportunity will depend on the specific positions we have.
Recently the cost of volatility has gone up and some products we used this winter are more expensive or are currently not available from counter-parties for next winter.
We are constantly evaluating the EWC portfolio to determine which product will best position us for 2015 while balancing cost and risk against our point of view.
Nevertheless if the same market conditions were to prevail next year we think we could experience up to 80% of the first quarter 2014 EBITDA without changing our hedging philosophy.
The bottom line is that our portfolio going forward still has plenty of price upside opportunity and embedded option value.
Now moving on to operating cash flow shown on Slide 6.
OCF was $767 million in the current quarter up $223 million or more than 40% higher than 2013.
Again higher net revenue from EWC and Utility was the largest driver demonstrating that the high-quality earnings we realized in the first quarter resulted in near-term cash flow.
I'll now turn to 2014 operational earnings guidance on Slide 7.
The strong first quarter results and increased volatility in Northeast Vermont and forward power markets pushed our 2014 earnings expectations above our original guidance range.
Our revised operational earnings per share guidance range is $5.55 to $6.75.
Starting with Utility net revenue there are a few drivers to note.
First we had $0.18 of positive weather that was partially offset by unbilled revenue as we noted earlier.
Also the outcome of some rate actions were different than originally planned last October.
Looking forward we still see 2014 Utility weather-adjusted retail sales on track to achieve the 1.9% growth we have previously noted.
At EWC based on realized prices to date and forwards at March 31 net revenue is expected to be significantly higher than we thought last October.
Approximately $0.90 per share was realized in first quarter results and approximately $0.45 per share is yet to come and still subject to market price variation.
The revised midpoint also reflects combined negative $0.20 in O&amp;M and other which is largely driven by the expectation for opportunistic spending in O&amp;M partly attributable to EWC performance this year and partly attributable to the potential to accelerate projects and in improving operation performance and reliability to benefit customers.
Looking at the opportunities available to us now this number may be lower over the balance of the year at both Utility and EWC.
The higher expense is also net of the expected benefit from a higher pension discount rate.
Moving down a line we currently see a higher effective income tax rate which will reduce earnings by $0.05 per share.
The overall variance is the net effect of changes in the 2 businesses.
About half of the effective rate increase is simply due to the application of statutory rate the incremental pretax earnings causing the overall effective tax rate to rise.
At the same time some of our expected Utility tax benefits are now more likely to fall into a future year.
On the Utility segment I will also note that most of the changes are not fundamental to the underlying strength of the business and there's no change in our expectations in Utility earnings growth through 2016.
Of course we still may do better in 2014.
Overall our guidance range reflects our expectations of earnings and volatility today.
Despite all that has happened it's still early in the year and undoubtedly things will continue to evolve.
We won't update the guidance range for changes as they arise unless we expect the year end operational results will likely end up outside the current range.
The first quarter of this year was a good beginning.
We created real value for our stakeholders and highlighted the optionality of EWC's business as well as the value of nuclear fuel diversity in the Northeast market.
During the quarter we've also seen encouraging signs for capacity auctions as well as improvements in forward power prices beyond 2014 moving towards our long-term bullish point of view.
At Utility with much of the uncertainty from 2013 behind us we're focused on positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities ahead.
In particular the strong economic development pipeline went beyond this year as seen in a new format on Slide 11.
As Leo said we'll delve deeper into these and other opportunities at the upcoming Analyst Day.
We look forward to seeing you there and now the Entergy team is available for questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll take a question from Kit Konolige from BGC.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple of follow-up items.
So can you go into a little more detail on the increase in the O&amp;M spending? If I understood it correctly I took away that it's an opportunistic spend due to the improved revenues and sort of reinvestment if you will.
Are there particular segments or companies or projects that you're spending that O&amp;M in? Thanks Kit.
Yes so at EWC that is certainly the case as well as the Utility.
And so at EWC part of that is paying people for the great performance that Leo talked about in the first quarter and part of it is looking for opportunities to move projects forward if those arise.
The challenge associated with those of course is that they are difficult projects to plan.
It's not easy to move a lot of O&amp;M forward like that and so we are getting an early start on it.
It's easier to pull back than it is to decide at the end of the year that you want to move a lot of O&amp;M forward.
At the Utility we're a little ahead of -- in that same regard.
It's something that's beneficial for customers in terms of rate stability if we can offset some of the beneficial weather.
And since it's still early in the year we don't know that we'll be able to actually have the opportunity at the Utility to do that.
And we'll certainly be looking at each company because not all Utility companies will likely have that same opportunity.
So -- but that's what we're working on today.
We're preparing.
We're trying to form up projects and we're looking for those opportunities.
But there's no guarantee that we'll openly end up spending that O&amp;M.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And on a separate area you mentioned that -- if I heard it right that 80% of the EBITDA in 2014 first quarter could recur in first quarter '15 and at $0.90 a share of the increase in the guidance range was due to the first quarter.
First just wanted to confirm that those were correct and I just want to try to get an idea of how much of a if you will permanent baseline change there is here in level of EPS and EBITDA that will recur in '15 and forward.
Obviously forward prices have gone up some and as you say volatility has gone up and so on.
If you can give us some idea of what we're looking at going forward that would be a big help.
I'll start with the math part and then I'll turn it over to Bill for the point of view discussion.
So I think the math that you had Kit was correct but I'd put a bunch of caveats in there as well.
So those are -- it's 80% under the same market conditions that we see next year in the first quarter.
And yes that is against the $0.90 increase plus the part that we already had built into guidance.
So it's the overall EBITDA that I was talking about when you look at it that way.
And so part of that is from the fact that Vermont Yankee is not going to be in our portfolio next year.
And part of that is as you said forward prices have already moved up so we do have some still open positions in our remaining portfolio.
They benefited from some of the price moves so far.
And so you get up above what Vermont Yankee's contribution was this quarter because some of our other positions have benefited from that early price rise.
So with that I think I'll turn...
This is Leo Kit.
Let me just jump in to make sure I -- I don't want you to -- I want to make sure you get the right specifics.
The 80% Drew was talking about is if the same price volatility happened next first quarter that happened this first quarter we're positioned that we can capture that value.
If you want to look at -- when you were asking about permanent the slide we have in the deck on EBITDA that's where the market is today.
And so you may not have been thinking this but I just want to make sure.
We're not saying that we already have 80% of what we've got this quarter -- first quarter next year.
If the same thing happened we're positioned to capture it.
That's what Drew was trying to say.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> It's the same market conditions but not the same weather obviously.
Well Kit whatever reason.
It might happen because of weather.
It might -- that would probably be why it would happen.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I get it okay.
It's basically just removing the Vermont Yankee impact.
That and some of the price rise that we've already seen so far this year.
As you said [indiscernible] prices have come up a little bit already.
Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just a quick one on the -- in the Slide 21 you're just alluding to talking about just sort of the look at market today.
Obviously you don't specify the numbers but it seems from the movement in the 2015 number in particular that it took -- probably up about $100 million of EBITDA outlook versus the prior version of this slide.
I guess my question is you've got 74% hedged.
You now expect to realize 53% on that versus 49% before which is a $4 uplift and then the market pricing slide is also kind of a $4 uplift.
And it seems 4x your generation ought to be closer to $150 million than $100 million.
So is there some offset? Does my math make any sense there? And is there some offset embedded in there? Or are you sort of embedding some conservatism about next year in particular? I'm not sure I followed all the way through on the last part but I think it should all kind of hold together.
I don't think there's any big offset built into the numbers that we're showing you there.
Research Division</strong> But your hedged is up $4 and your open is up $4 and you've got 35 terawatt hours.
It just doesn't seem that the bar is moving as much as it should by some reasonable margin.
Well there is a bit of rounding in there as well but there's -- we don't have any unplanned or hidden offsets in there.
We're showing you just the revenue uplift there.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then if I may on this discussion you just had about the 80% and the 20% if we have a repeat of this year's conditions next year.
What -- can you be a bit more specific about what kinds of products that you use this year are not available in the market for next year and how you're -- and just some more color on how you're adapting to changes in available products in the market? Sure.
This is Bill.
I think as we've explained previously we use a variety of different products.
So some of that includes unit contingent.
Some of that includes cap collars.
And we use a variety of different option structures both European which clear on a forward basis versus Asian options which clear more on a daily basis.
As you can appreciate as the volatility in this market has increased and if you look at daily volatility from -- for example from winter '13 to winter '14 we've probably seen a pickup of over 50% between '14 and '13.
Obviously some folks who were willing to sell those products in the past have reconsidered their risk profile.
And so right now they are not as willing to offer those products and so we have to readjust our portfolio to what's actually available in the market to be able to capture that.
However as Drew said we still believe we have the opportunity to capture a significant portion of those upside but it will be a different portfolio and there will be different prices associated with the products available due to that increased volatility.
We'll take our next question from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Research Division</strong> I think I just want to better understand the changes that are taking place in the Utility guidance for '14.
I guess the starting point would be there's a $0.20 reduction in the midpoint and that includes the $0.18 of positive weather in the first quarter.
So are we really looking at sort of a delta here of $0.38? Is that...
Yes.
This is Drew Paul.
That's a good question.
So in the net revenue line there is an offset to that $0.18 in our unbilled revenue category.
And unbilled is something we don't normally talk about because it's usually kind of plus or minus right around 0.
But this quarter it's a large number and it has to do with sort of the estimates at the end of each quarter that we make.
And so it was -- it's really sort of a holdover from the very end of '13 when it was really cold those last couple of weeks in December.
Those dollars have since gone into the build revenue category.
And we're backing them out of the unbilled category and you see the offset to the build.
So it's about -- as I said it's $0.09 quarter-over-quarter.
It was about $0.10 between December and the first quarter of this year.
So that's the biggest thing in that net revenue line that you're probably not seeing completely there.
Research Division</strong> Right.
So that -- in other words if that's $0.09 out of what would be potentially $0.38 what would be -- or is it $0.09 out of what really is $0.20? That's what I'm trying to figure out because don't I need to add the...
If you're looking at $0.30 I think you're looking at quarter-to-quarter versus the $5.20 midpoint is just for 2014.
And so our expectations for 2014 from the net revenue perspective have been largely met except you would say plus $0.18 for weather minus $0.10 for unbilled and then a little other noise in there to get you that plus $0.05.
And then...
Research Division</strong> Okay so that -- but then that still leaves like $0.28.
So in other words I'm just trying to figure out what drove it -- what's driving the $0.28 and whether that's -- we should look at that as potentially recurring items or nonrecurring items? I'm not sure I'm following where you're getting the $0.28 from.
I'm sorry.
I think when we said $0.28 it's plus $0.18 weather this quarter versus minus $0.10 first quarter of '13.
So there's a $0.28 weather delta there.
Is that what you're looking at? Research Division</strong> No I'm just taking the $0.20 change in the midpoint of the guidance adding in the weather of $0.18 and then subtracting out the $0.09 or the $0.10 that you gave me for...
Okay.
So then -- so if you come down on the guidance table maybe what you're seeing is there's a bit of the opportunity spending and then the other part is the taxes piece.
There were some tax items that we thought would occur this year when we set guidance in October.
It looks like those have pushed back a little bit probably into '15 and so that has moved out.
We don't -- we still think those things will happen.
The timing has just changed on them.
So those are the -- from the guidance table those are the main drivers.
Research Division</strong> And the opportunity spend and the taxes together would sort of represent the difference? And -- because you also mentioned somewhere in there rate case outcomes.
Right right.
And so that's the smaller piece that's in that net revenue line item.
That's part of what gets you down to the $0.05 and it has more to do with the Arkansas rate case at the end of the year probably than anything.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And still the expectation -- so even with sort of -- so in other words if the Arkansas decision isn't reversed you're still confident that you can come up with other offsets by '16 to get to the same $950 billion Utility net income number.
That's correct.
That's correct.
And as Leo said we're looking for ways to exceed that.
So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of our 2016 number.
Recall that that doesn't include any tax benefit in it and we have all the industrial renaissance and economic development opportunities in front of us.
We think that's pretty safe right now.
Our next question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Just on the hedging strategy just make sure so I understand this in the ratable or kind of point of view base that you guys are using you didn't really increase hedge positions in the quarter.
What is the thought process for adding on any out years as we move through this year? And what kind of percentage hedges do you want to have maybe going into 2015? What -- I mean typically we look at prompts here we hedge 85% of that position.
So that's kind of the guidelines that we followed and we'll expect to continue to follow.
Of course this year effectively we were a little less than that due to the fact of the uncertainty around VY and how long that unit would run and the uncertainty around the CPG.
But we would intend to be hedged in an 85% level.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then on -- kind of with the MISO integration you haven't had a little more time with it and then some of these issues that have come up between transfer between MISO classic and MISO South.
Can you maybe give a little color on how you guys see that getting resolved what impact that's had on even with the value proposition of joining MISO from what you guys originally anticipated? And is that going to have any bearing on potential CapEx opportunities with the MISO transformation? [Indiscernible].
And gentlemen this is the operator.
We are unable to hear you at this time.
[Technical Difficulty] The point I was making on the SPP MISO issue for the company SPP filed a complaint at FERC seeking to -- in essence to have FERC charge MISO for any excess capacity beyond the 1 000-megawatt limitation and the tie-in between MISO North and MISO South the point being that we're in the initial stages of the litigation if you will.
We have not -- we've not ruled out the possibility or likelihood of resolving that issue by way of settlement.
But if we were to ultimately go to hearing and if SPP were to maintain their position that is essentially what they're seeking to limit that inner regional dispatch to 1 000-megawatts and to issue that payment to SPP from MISO for any megawatts beyond that 1 000-megawatt capacity so the debate is really about that.
We don't have a point of view on how MISO would address it if FERC were to find that SPP's position was well founded.
But again it's early in the process so we really don't know kind of how that plays out at that the moment.
Research Division</strong> If this were to not get resolved would this affect the value proposition of you guys joining MISO? No.
Next we'll hear from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
LLC</strong> Just wanted to first clarify how the LHV pricing came in relative to your expectation of a $2 increase for the full year maybe just some color on that.
Yes.
I think as you know the LHV pricing came in for the summer strip rider a little bit under $10.
May auction spot auction was around $12.25.
So that's in excess of our original estimate.
LLC</strong> Okay.
Not a whole lot.
No not significantly higher but I mean it was a limit bit higher than what we had used as our kind of midpoint.
LLC</strong> Okay.
It's really hard to tell because the $2 like an average for the year.
That's right.
LLC</strong> So if we were thinking about this for a summer strip was it $1 or $2 or something like that above what you would have thought the summer strip price? It's less than -- much less than $1 on an average basis.
LLC</strong> Okay.
So that's -- any LHV pricing that's assumed in the EBITDA -- any New York capacity pricing assumed in the EBITDA charts that you have should be pretty close even though you didn't update for that.
It shouldn't be that different based on what came out.
No that's right.
It should be consistent with what came out.
LLC</strong> Okay.
One other question just on clarifying kind of your point of view on New England and the like.
And one could argue that there's obviously some pretty severe constraints.
We also did seem to have some relatively severe weather maybe not as much just in New England but like kind of the whole regional area or maybe the whole northern part of the country.
So when you're talking kind of the bullish point of view and keeping your strategy the same is it -- in a normal winter weather situation do you think there'd be this much extreme or still have kind of an extreme option value that things are that bad in New England that even normal weather you want to keep the big option position? Yes.
I mean here's the way we think about it is we've seen volatility in those markets in the last 2 winters okay? And this winter obviously was more severe than the winter of 2013 but nevertheless we saw volatility.
Now take into consideration for 2014 you've got Salem Harbor coming off that's about 750 megawatts.
VY will be off in the first part of 2015.
It'll actually shut down at the end of this year.
And then you've got other units like Brayton Point that will come off in 2017.
So you're losing a substantial amount of resources over the next 4 to 5 years.
In fact if you look at their overall portfolio you're going to lose about 4 000 megawatts which represents about 10% of their generation -- over 10% of their generation capacity.
And reserve margins obviously have declined to the point where FCA 8 resulted in a deficiency and you went to basically new build prices for new resources.
So there's a lot of dynamics going on there but we believe that there will continue to be constraints.
While there's a minimal amount of new pipeline capacity coming on due to compression projects that type of thing we don't believe it's adequate to replace the additional capacity that will be retired.
Next we'll hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
So I hear your comments with Steve on the markets and what have you and I also heard your opening comments which sort of indicated substantial concern with the way the market's being structured and what have you.
And so I guess so to follow-up on this do you guys -- I mean I know what you guys are planning in terms of your filings and I've followed your Exelon and Entergy joint filing on the Forward Capacity 9.
But is there a plan b if in fact we don't get the market structure that you guys contemplate? Or should we think basically that things are sort of going in your direction and you guys are cautiously optimistic and we're going to be seeing this sort of process continue in the stakeholder process what have you and see how it plays out? Or is there perhaps another strategy you guys might be thinking about to get more value for your generation plan? Well it gets to be a little bit complex but let me lay this out.
So we're working through the stakeholder process both in New York and in New England and at FERC and we believe there's improvements to be made in the capacity market design.
We believe there's improvements to be made in the energy market design and we also believe that there are opportunities to be fairly compensated -- for generators to be fairly compensated based on the actual attributes they provide for example on-site fuel 0 carbon emissions et cetera.
That is going to be a fairly lengthy process.
We think we will see some immediate improvements for example in ISO New England with real-time energy pricing coming up by the end of this year.
Leo mentioned the slope demand curve.
In the interim as we have mentioned we expect to see quite a bit of volatility in the markets just due to the constraints themselves.
And so when you say is there a plan b I mean we're kind of working all of those in parallel and we expect to see some continued volatility until some of these market issues get resolved.
And I think the polar vortex brought to the attention of all the markets and to the regulators that we've got some structural design issues that need to be addressed.
Okay.
Going back to Forward Capacity Auction #9 there is this new entry pricing extension that's being proposed and I was wondering if you could -- if you have any thoughts -- I mean obviously you guys are against it.
I understand that.
But if you have any thoughts about what the -- I mean what the impact might be if that provision stays in the -- it could be whatever the proposal that New England put forth? I'll make sure I understand.
Are you talking about the exemption as it relates to the renewables associated with that and the slope demand curve? Yes the slope demand curve filing and the new entry pricing extension they're going to increase by 40% MISO proposing from 5 to 7 years for new entry pricing.
Yes.
Right.
And I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about what that impact might be or if that's significant given the constraints you're talking about on the gas side or...
I think our point of view is we're not necessarily probably hung up on the 5 to 7.
What has -- the most challenging for us is that when the ISO sets -- has new capacity enter the market they choose a number of $7 a kW/month to provide existing generators.
And so we believe with the slope demand curve that we have the opportunity depending on resource availability to see additional upside probably somewhere -- to $10 or $11 of kW/month once that slope demand curve gets put in place.
Regardless of these other market design issues such as the extension and the exemption that you were discussing earlier that even with those in place you still think that the capacity price should probably get up there.
Is that right? We still think -- I mean obviously we're concerned about the exemptions because it's another intervention into kind of what's referred to as the competitive market.
But we -- even with that we believe that there is some additional upside from a capacity perspective capacity pricing perspective.
We'll take our last question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to just talk through the low growth numbers that you're seeing which is obviously robust compared to the national average.
Are there certain areas that stand out as the strongest areas of growth? And do those offer potentially more transmission spend than you've been currently contemplating? Theo you want to...
Steven this is Theo.
I guess we talked about that we would probably want to talk to answer the second part of your question really more around customer class maybe somewhat.
And when we look at residential and commercial I think for the past few years we've expected what we saw last year kind of a dip in growth that being driven primarily by energy efficiency policies primarily at the federal level somewhat around -- primarily around lighting.
And I think what you're seeing now in 2014 and the first quarter as compared to 2013 is really a return to what we had probably seen on the simple average load growth 2010 through 2012 prior to 2013.
So -- and it's something I mean we somewhat anticipated post the dip we saw in 2013.
When you now talk about industrial and you talk about the industrial renaissance we talked about fairly extensively Leo mentioned on this call and we've talked about previously as that growth shows up and it shows up to the extent that we've embedded it within the context of our guidance numbers and to the extent it shows up even greater yes there is the opportunity for additional transmission investment to connect that resources to that demand growth to that load growth.
We have some -- obviously a transmission bill we have within the context of our current construction plan reflects the expectation we have relative to -- out to the 2.5% 2.25% sales growth.
But to the extent that growth goes beyond that which again given what we're seeing we view as a possibility there could be transmission to connect those load pockets and we could do additional transmission spend associated with that.
Stephen from a transmission point of view obviously the way to think about it is we've got a plan.
The construction plan of the $1.7 billion over the next 3-year period that would include some of the economic development activity we have in our plan for that timeframe the 2% to 2.25% load growth.
The renaissance the projects the $65 billion that's been announced that we were talking about that goes up to 2019 so that's even farther.
To the extent that we pick up more as Theo mentioned there's an increment that could show up just in the base business.
So you've got the current run rate.
You got -- if we could outsize the growth on top of that outside growth we get more -- against the other 2 buckets also obviously exists with the -- you look at the FERC Order 1000 issue MEP MVP projects that's out there as well that we would anticipate participating in it at some level certainly within our service territory.
And then there's that opportunity outside of it too which we're certainly going to consider what we do there as well.
So there's -- the transmission part of the business is actually more complicated and more interesting because of it given those different buckets that are all pretty robust at this moment.
But the normal load growth in and of itself is pretty good based on what we've already got line of sight on.
The incremental piece on that could make that even better if were successful in our strategy to attract and serve that load.
And then we've got these other 2 buckets that we're evaluating and certainly we're going to have to make sure we do everything we can to do the right thing for our customers and work with our regulators on how we would all work through that.
But that's an extremely interesting part of the business for us right now that we get to work through.
Research Division</strong> That's very helpful and I just had a very quick factual question just on the EWC business.
I assume that the forecast still includes the DOE nuclear waste disposal fee.
Is that correct? Yes.
Well Stephen there's as you know the possibility that that might not be in there.
We sort of factored that into our midpoint $6.15.
If it comes in or I should say goes away sometime in June it would be about $0.08.
Research Division</strong> Understood.
But in the out year EBITDA numbers you're still assuming that you still have to pay that fee? That's correct.
At this time I'll turn things back over to Ms.
Paula Waters for any additional or closing remarks.

Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties is included in the company's SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Thank you Paula and good morning everyone.
As many of you know at Entergy delivering safe secure reliable power underpins everything we do.
Our work is especially exciting during periods of growth.
No one wants to hinder economic development or job creation and everyone wants to be part of a brighter more prosperous future.
I'm pleased to say that in the second quarter of 2014 this focus allowed us to deliver our commitments to all 4 of our stakeholders: our owners customers employees and the communities we serve.
Weather aside results in the second quarter were largely consistent with our expectations and I suspect with yours.
The state of Entergy's business is strong.
At Utility we saw strong industrial sales growth.
All of our operating companies improved by several points in the annual J.D.
Power residential customer satisfaction survey.
River Bend earned an excellence rating for its operations joining Indian Point which earned the same rating in the first quarter.
At EWC the nuclear fleet delivered fewer outage days allowing us to provide extended periods of uninterrupted power to the market.
This kind of excellence which we see from our plants to our corporate operations is driven by the determination and dedication of Entergy employees and I'd like to take a minute here to acknowledge that hard work and to say thank you.
Many of you on this call heard us present our growth objectives in Analyst Day on June 5.
We continue to see a path to achieving each of these including the consolidated earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 2% to 4% through 2016 which is based on our point of view of market prices.
In the second quarter we continued to position the company for this growth.
Let me address how we did so beginning with the Utility.
The big story for us at the Utility continues to be the economic growth in our service area and all of us at Entergy are doing our part to both drive and leverage this growth.
As I mentioned earlier industrial sales increased quarter-over-quarter resulting in a growth rate of more than 5% which included expansions.
At Analyst Day we said that we believe the opportunity of 1 700 megawatts through 2016.
At the end of the second quarter we had completed negotiations of approximately 1 200 megawatts.
This includes about 100 megawatts signed since June.
We expect to see this trajectory continue through the end of the year and well into decade's end.
We anticipate that meeting this growing demand will require significant capital needs over and above current levels but it will also require a focus on 4 areas: First as I said earlier safe secure and reliable power; second an efficient operations responsive to customer needs; third financial strength and stability; and fourth regulatory frameworks that allow us to expand the system to meet anticipated demand.
Starting with the first item on the list we continue to invest in our infrastructure to ensure that we are able to safely deliver power to all of our customers even in difficult circumstances.
As we've said before we'll be deploying nearly $6 billion through 2016 on generation transmission and distribution systems throughout Utility.
We intend to make this investment while keeping electricity affordable.
As many of you know historically Entergy's rates have been about 20% below the national average and these low rates benefit our industrial customers just as much as families and the communities we serve.
Moving to item 2 on the list.
We continue to look for ways to become a nimbler more efficient organization.
This was the impetus behind the company-wide restructuring we announced last year which by 2016 will have removed $200 million to $250 million in costs company-wide.
We're also working hard on all fronts to support load growth in utility infrastructure needs.
For example as part of that restructuring we created a new department whose sole mission is to manage capital projects to ensure that they are planned implemented and finished in a timely and efficient manner.
We're expanding resources for functions central to our strategy of economic development and nuclear oversight.
We're also streamlining back-office functions.
Partly as a result of this reinvigorated focus our plans at the Utility remain on track as are efforts to make our business even more reliable effective and efficient.
For example in May to ensure reliable affordable power as well as to respond to the state's evolving generation landscape Entergy Arkansas issued an RFP for 200 to 600 megawatts of long-term resources beginning in 2017.
No self-build options are being considered and selections are targeted for November.
In July we issued an RFP for 650 to 1 000 megawatts beginning in 2020 in the Amite South planning region in Southeast Louisiana.
As part of the RFP we will be testing a self-build option at our existing Little Gypsy site.
Proposals are targeted for November.
You may remember that a few years ago the 550-megawatt Ninemile 6 plant was selected through a similar process.
Barring unforeseen circumstances this the first new combined cycle natural gas fired plant to be built by the Utility should be completed by the end of the year.
We want to be in a position to replicate this success and are working to ensure that we will be.
In transmission we're in the process of evaluating potential projects to help us connect new industrial customers expand our capacity to serve the load and enhance the economics of providing safe secure reliable power.
We're also working to finalize our annual long-term transmission reliability plan for submission to MISO.
Moving to the third area.
Financial strength gives us the flexibility to expand our system to meet step-out industrial growth.
For example last month Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a study that included a preliminary analysis of combining the 2 companies.
As we expected the study showed that a larger company would improve the financial flexibility of the Louisiana companies and help finance investment required to serve new industrial customers.
For our regulators a combined company would save millions of dollars in administrative costs.
The added geographic and customer diversity of a consolidated company will also help it withstand storms and sector-specific economic downturns.
This leads me to the fourth area of focus regulatory frameworks.
For some time now we have been working with our regulators to find ways to streamline processes and identify new regulatory mechanisms that benefit current and potential customers as well as Entergy.
Two examples of these would be riders and certification mechanisms that our regulators have had in place for many years and regulatory tools used at other utilities like forward test years.
We are pleased to say that the second quarter saw progress on this front.
In June for the first time in 12 years Entergy Mississippi filed a general rate case.
This multifaceted plan is designed to position our Mississippi service territory for economic growth and development by improving reliability modernizing the grid stabilizing rates and implementing new technologies.
From a rate-making perspective Entergy Mississippi has proposed revisions to the formula rate plan to use a forward test year which will help bring transmission service to some of Mississippi's most attractive industrial sites.
EMI has also proposed several rate incentives for industries and small businesses all of which are designed to support job creation.
All these items safe reliable power operational efficiency financial strength and regulatory frameworks are just some examples of how we are executing our plan to support economic growth across our 4-state Utility service territory.
Turning now to EWC.
As I mentioned earlier our financial results for the quarter reflects strong operational performance as well as higher power prices.
As you know our strategy is to preserve the optionality and manage the risk in this commodity-based business.
As we saw again commodity prices are volatile.
Overall from March 31 through June 30 average 2015 and 2016 forward prices for New York Zone G and New England's Mass Hub increased an average of $3.81 per megawatt hour peaking on June 3.
Since June 30 prices for those 2 years are off by 9%.
While short-term power and natural gas markets have not been constructed due to recent production gains and mild summer weather long-term market fundamentals as discussed in Analyst Day remain sound.
In addition to a robust long-term demand picture for natural gas starting next year we see a wave of older coal unit retirements coupled with higher pricing for CO2 under the Northeast regional pact continued power volatility during constrained periods long-term load recovery and the potential for lower-than-expected energy efficiency gains.
All of these factors will likely lift power prices to higher levels than indicated by current forwards in 2016 and beyond.
For these reasons among others we remain both resolute and optimistic about the future.
On the capacity side ISO New England is implementing a downward sloping demand curve in next February's auction for the 2018 to 2019 capability period.
This will help provide appropriate incentives to ensure that existing economic capacity continues to operate and that new capacity is constructed to ensure reliability.
With respect to Indian Point in June the New York ISO released a draft of its biannual reliability needs assessment.
For the fourth report in a row the ISO found that Indian Point is critical to maintaining the reliability of the grid in New York and that its closure would cause transmission problems and worsen existing risk of outages beyond acceptable levels.
It should be no surprise to anyone that for a variety of reasons Indian Point is and will remain a critical part of the generation mix of New York and we are committed to ensuring its continued safe operation.
I'm now going to turn to some significant developments on the environmental front.
The past 3 months have seen a lot of activity on issues ranging from air to water quality.
In April the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's cross-state air pollution rules which were introduced in 2011.
In May after several delays the EPA issued the final 316b cooling water intake regulation revisions.
And in June the agency released the proposed rule on carbon emissions from existing units.
The Casper in 316b rules will have some effect in our operations.
And while we are still studying the specifics we believe them to be manageable.
I know that the proposed rule on carbon has been getting a lot of attention so let me spend a little bit of time on that.
As you know Entergy's overall fleet both Utility and EWC is one of the cleanest in the nation.
In fact our fleet exceeds EPA guidelines for new build power plants which mandate that new natural gas plants emit no more than 1 000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour.
Today Entergy's fleet emits about 580 pounds per megawatt hour driven largely by the prevalence of nuclear power clear evidence that carbon reduction goals cannot be met without maintaining the nation's nuclear generation capacity.
The proposed rule governs emission state-by-state and for this reason is arguably the most complex regulation EPA has proposed in recent history.
We continue to study it and its potential implications and we've continued to have productive discussions with EPA staff.
However our concern is that the implementation of the rule that is its impact would not match the agency's stated objectives.
So at this point we have more questions than answers and I think it's fair to say this is a point that is shared across the industry.
The public comment period on the proposed rule closes October 16.
By that time we expect to have a crystallized point of view.
We plan to present that perspective to the EPA as well as our stakeholders including those of you on this call so stay tuned.
In closing I want to reiterate that we believe the future of our business is strong.
Our plans are structured to facilitate growth at our Utility and to take advantage of the optionality inherent in our nuclear fleet.
At Analyst Day we detailed our near-term objectives what we believe we can achieve financially and operationally to help grow our economies support job creation help maintain and improve the environment and enhance and replace the infrastructure to improve reliability.
There are a number of building blocks to this vision some we control some we do not.
So it's worth noting that our business is by nature volatile in the short term.
However this short-term volatility should not and does not change our confidence in the long-term fundamentals.
The classic example is the recent steep drop in natural gas prices driven mainly by weather.
This has not changed our longer-term bullish views.
As such we continue to see a line of sight to our 3-year Entergy EPS growth outlook.
Other factors affecting our business include the timing of complex industrial projects evolving policy landscapes in our states as well as in Washington and of course the weather.
Again the fundamentals are strong even with this uncertainty.
At Utility with respect to industrial projects that support growth some will move more quickly than anticipated and some may be delayed.
For example Big River Steel got its financing and permitting this past quarter and is moving ahead.
We had originally anticipated Big River to be completed in 2015 now it looks like it will be 2016.
At EWC rising demand for natural gas and shrinking reserve margins combined with infrastructure constraints and the region's growing need for environmentally and economically sustainable reliable power point to higher value for EWC nuclear portfolio.
Despite such uncertainty we know the shale revolution will continue for far into the foreseeable future to drive competitive U.S.
natural gas prices and liquid prices relative to the rest of the world.
So we can be confident as indeed we are that whatever the particulars in our service territory is the stage is set for significant economic growth.
And as I said a number of times already we're doing everything we can to make that growth happen.
So today as it has been for more than a century Entergy's business is a long-term play.
Over the years we have prided ourselves on delivering strong value for our stakeholders including a long history of dividend payments and growth to our owners.
Results in the second quarter are further evidence of this and the progress we've made on many fronts over the past 18 months.
But I also want to say that we are committed to ensuring that short-term volatility does not compromise the long-term health of the business or that of our stakeholders.
A lot of the initiatives we undertook during the second quarter are also a good demonstration of that.
With that I'll turn the call over to Drew who will review our financial performance for the quarter and update you on our 3-year outlook.
Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
Today I will review the financial results for the quarter as well as our forward-looking outlook.
Starting with Slide 2.
Our second quarter results for the current and prior years are shown on an as reported and on operational bases.
Operational earnings per share were $1.11 in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $1.01 in 2013.
Operational results excluded special items from the decision to close Vermont Yankee HCM implementation and the transmission spin-merge effort last year.
Turning to operational results on Slide 3.
Entergy's operational earnings increased driven primarily by higher earnings at EWC.
Parent &amp; Other earnings were flat and at Utility operational earnings per share were $1.17 $0.01 lower than a year ago.
There are a few key offsetting drivers.
For the quarter Utility net revenue was a positive driver.
Retail sales growth for the quarter was 2.1% or 2.6% on a weather-adjusted basis.
Industrial customer class had the strongest gains of 5.3%.
Industrial growth was broad-based across multiple segments led by refining chemicals and small industrials and aided by several expansions.
Increases within ETIs and EGSL service areas drove industrial growth.
Sales growth was offset by the effects of weather including milder-than-normal weather in this quarter's unbilled period.
The quarterly net revenue increase also reflected higher price resulting from rate actions.
A portion of the price increase was offset by other line items.
Despite the spending increases offset in net revenue nonfuel O&amp;M was favorable quarter-over-quarter reflecting our cost management efforts.
Improvements from net revenue and O&amp;M were offset by higher depreciation expense and higher effective income tax rate.
Now moving on to EWC.
EWC's operational earnings per share of $0.18 was higher than the $0.07 earned a year ago.
EWC EBITDA for the quarter summarized on Slide 4 was $84 million higher than last year.
The increase is due to higher net revenue from improved sales volume following continued operational improvement in our merchant nuclear fleet.
This is illustrated by a stellar 95% nuclear fleet capacity factor for the quarter versus 82% in 2013.
Unplanned outage days were dramatically reduced by 37 days and there were no refueling outage days in the second quarter of this year.
The average realized price for EWC's nuclear fleet also improved to just under $50 per megawatt hour compared to $46.40 a year ago or about 7% higher.
The price increase was largely due to capacity prices while energy prices were relatively flat.
Now moving on to operating cash flow shown on Slide 5.
OCF was $761 million in the current quarter up $189 million from 2013.
Higher net revenue from EWC was the largest driver.
I'll now turn to forward-looking information.
In today's release we affirmed our 2014 operational earnings per share guidance range of $5.55 to $6.75.
Based on the result through the second quarter and June 30 forward prices our current expectations point to just below the midpoint of the range due largely to mild weather in the second quarter.
As we think about the remainder of 2014 there are a few things we're paying close attention to.
For EWC we have seen market forwards for the balance of the year come down since June 30.
There are also open regulatory proceedings that could see resolution this year at Utility.
For example the Waterford 3 steam generator prudence review is currently in process.
On the call last quarter we also discussed the expectations for incremental opportunistic 2014 O&amp;M spending aimed at accelerating projects improving top line growth and improving operational performance and reliability to benefit customers.
Identified opportunities have fallen more into the improvement categories but are generally consistent with the amounts outlined last quarter.
EWC spending is a little lower than discussed last quarter while Utility spending is a little higher.
Now let's turn to 2015.
For the past several years on this call we provided a few thoughts for prompt year earnings.
Following that practice Slide 6 summarizes considerations for next year.
The issues are probably what most of you expect.
A few things of note.
At the Utility drivers include a full year of rate actions in 2014 including ELL's $10 million rate increase in December of this year and potential rate actions in 2015 including the EMI rate case which is in progress.
Also recall that last quarter we noted that some of our Utility tax benefits originally expected in 2014 are now more likely to fall into 2015.
And at EWC note that the EBITDA expectation includes the full year benefit of DOE waste fees set at 0.
At our Analyst Day we also provided 3-year long-term outlooks for the Utility business net income EWC operational adjusted EBITDA and consolidated earnings per share growth.
As Leo indicated earlier the precise building blocks or how we achieve those outlooks are likely to change due to the nature of our business.
Utility outlook is to achieve $1 billion to $1.50 billion of operational net income by 2016.
The unique industrial growth opportunity is the cornerstone in Utility's earnings outlook.
They [ph] continue to develop new leverage to grow the top line and make productive investments beyond the discussions at the Analyst Day to ensure we meet those expectations.
At EWC operational adjusted EBITDA estimates that we provide in our webcast in the Appendix material are based on market prices as of a certain point in time.
2016 prices from our Analyst Day were consistent with both our point of view and April 30 forwards but we're about 4% higher than market prices as of June 30.
This has led to lower June 30 mark-to-market EBITDA around the bottom of our stated point of view range for 2016.
Our point of view development is an evergreen process.
Our point of view evaluates longer-term fundamentals that's not as volatility as day-to-day market prices.
Despite some near-term gas market headwinds we still expect to see natural gas demand pick up over the next 5 years and drive marginal natural gas drilling towards slightly higher-priced dry gas areas.
Meanwhile we continue to see tightening reserve margins in key Northeast power markets.
With these considerations we reasonably believe that we can meet our consolidated 2016 growth target even with volatility and the underlying earnings drivers.
Our Analyst Day in June is barely in the rearview mirror.
We laid out then and reinforce today how we intend to create sustainable value for our 4 key stakeholders: our owners customers employees and communities.
And while the building blocks will evolve over time we still intend to achieve the overarching goals that we communicated at our Analyst Day as we look to aggressively grow the Utility and actively preserve the optionality and manage the risk at EWC.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Dan Eggers at Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Just following up on the point of view conversation which is obviously getting a lot of attention.
If the point of view was consistent with where prices were earlier in the second quarter can you talk about the lack of additional hedging that happened from the first quarter to the second quarter and how you guys are going to kind of approach the hedging strategy over the remainder of the year? Sure.
Dan this is Bill.
A couple of things.
As we look at what's happened in the short term -- shorter-term market as mentioned we've seen moderate weather increasing storage obviously the front end of the curve has dropped down.
However when you look at 2015 we are still -- our point of view is consistent with the market.
And in fact in the second quarter we executed about 750 megawatts of hedges or converting placeholder hedges into more fixed-price hedges which represents about 17% of the portfolio.
So at this point in time we believe we have got 2015 adequately hedged.
As you look out into the future '16 and beyond our point of view is largely unchanged.
Perhaps 2016 was reduced a little bit from a point of view perspective.
But remember that as we talk about the ability to hedge there's a couple of things to consider.
One is -- and primarily is the liquidity out in the marketplace.
So as we look at hedging '16 to '18 we're seeing a much less liquidity than we do for 2015.
Obviously our point of view is higher than current market prices and increasingly higher as you go further out on the curve really due to the drivers both from a heat rate perspective heat rates being compressed and our point of view on demand for natural gas.
So we remain bullish on natural gas because of addition of gas generation shutdown of coal units incremental industrial load additional exports to Mexico and LNG expansion.
So really the challenge we face '16 to '18 is just a lack of liquidity and the fact that our point of view was substantially higher.
The other piece of that is if you remember I think we were pretty clear at Analyst Day volatility in the markets has been substantial since the polar vortex.
Therefore making structured products options et cetera much more costly and really we don't believe now is the time to put those hedges on.
Research Division</strong> And then Leo there seem to be a couple of Utility properties for sale in the region.
Can you just remind us how you guys think about M&amp;A and how that prioritizes against the CapEx program you guys have internally? Sure Dan.
The whole M&amp;A question for us has not changed in terms of how we think about it.
We have our objectives as a company that we're trying to meet in terms of growing the business.
And if we can do transactions that will facilitate that objective we will do them.
So something with a growth opportunity something with a balance sheet opportunity something with a cash flow opportunity things like that.
The capital decision that you're talking about for us is probably a little bit unique in that we have significant amount of growth opportunities that reside within the Utility itself the organic kind of growth.
So that just I guess would tend to potentially make the bar higher if we were looking to deploy capital deploy balance sheet towards something.
It would have to be a superior way to grow the business than the objectives or the opportunities that we have within the business itself.
And again as we've talked about a lot of times the size of the customers that we look to add that 1 700-megawatts is between now and kind of the foreseeable future.
But as long as oil to gas ratio stays where it is as long as the opportunities remain out there from a manufacturing standpoint we -- that was just a point-in-time estimate.
We go out beyond that.
We would continue to see that growth opportunity.
So nothing's changed.
If you think about our objectives growing the Utility business and preserving the optionality within EWC if we can help manage that with a transaction we'll do it.
But the thing we have to be mindful of is the capital deployment opportunities we have within the business as well.
And we'll go next to Michael Weinstein with UBS.
Research Division</strong> It's Julien here actually.
Excellent.
So first question on the EWC side if you could comment.
With regards to what's going on in New York not just the highway but the REV how do you see that impacting the future of Indian Point? And perhaps more broadly what are your latest thoughts on the Lower Hudson Valley pricing and sustainability as a construct if you could comment? Sure this is Bill.
As it relates to our point of view on New York if you look at where they stand obviously they're in a situation where they've got declining reserve margins.
In fact as Leo mentioned if you look at their projections as they go into the future they really need Indian Point.
In fact if they try to pull Indian Point out of the portfolio even with some of the resource additions proposed they violate reliability limits.
So we believe that projects or policies such as REV are certainly something that can be implemented over time but it will take a substantial amount of time to implement those.
And if you look at a lot of the proposed projects in New York and the timing associated with those projects you really have to question the viability of those projects and if they can meet the actual commercial operations date.
So our point of view is that Indian Point remains critical for reliability economic sustainability and also environmental sustainability.
As it relates to Lower Hudson Valley zone we feel confident that FERC will uphold its decision on that zone.
Prices can change in that zone as resources are added.
As we look out into the future we include some of that in our forecast.
Obviously Danskammer is on the front burner right now and so we're watching that very closely.
Our point of view on that is that maybe part of that unit may become commercially viable within a reasonable period of time.
The rest of that unit may take longer as it relates to the larger units at that facility.
But we -- in general we believe that the pricing associated with LHV will be maintained and that FERC will uphold its prior decisions.
Research Division</strong> Excellent.
And could you just clarify a little bit on the last question when it comes to your 2% to 4% range in the context of the latest commodities? Can you clarify do you see any improvement on the regulated side to offset the commodity? Or are you effectively saying status quo we're moving forward on the plan on the regulated side and we have a view on the commodity that is different than the commodity is today? This is Drew.
It's more of the latter Julien.
It's -- the Utility we continue to look for ways that we can look for levers that can help us maintain the $1 billion to $1.50 billion and if the opportunity is available maybe go above that.
But right now what we're talking about is -- at the Utility is the $1 billion to $1.50 billion.
And then our point of view is the part at EWC that gets us back to the 2% to 4%.
And we'll go next to Kit Konolige of BGC.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> So I wanted to ask a little bit about your mention Leo of the carbon rule.
I noted that you said that the implementation may not match the EPA's objectives if I can quote or misquote you.
But can you give us a little more detail on what you think the development of that situation might look like? Sure.
Rod will handle that.
Behind the comment is the observation.
We're not going to make a formal statement beyond it.
It's the observation that the state-by-state limits that have been -- or at least are evident in the EPA proposed rule -- remember it is just a proposal -- suggest to us that we're not going to -- it's not going to be an easy path to achieve across-the-board emissions if we're just limited to a state-by-state approach.
Our fear is that the marginal cost of compliance across the board is ultimately going to wind up working against EPA's objectives to reduce carbon and have a greater impact on for instance jobs the cost of electricity for customers.
Here where we see the chaos creating problems for EPA's objectives.
If we aren't able between now and October to arrive at let's just call it a consensus position for EPA given the industry given their respective states we're going to put -- we're going to force EPA to wind up having to go a square against Congress and as a forcing mechanism to try and get at a comprehensive energy plan.
We don't see that as being realistic within EPA's time line.
And what we're trying to figure out between now and October is whether or not there's a path that allows us to get there.
And so we're taking a very cautious approach but recognizing the complexity of this rule alone.
It's just making it really difficult for us to see a path where EPA is actually achieving these stated goals of achieving though its 4 what we call building blocks to achieving any realistically -- achievable enforceable rules at the end of the day.
And Entergy has been at the forefront of the greenhouse gas reductions from 2012.
And just from our limited perspective given where we are today we really don't see how beyond EPA's stated goals how they get there from here.
It's just -- we're trying to remain optimistic.
We're trying to remain engaged with the EPA and figuring out whether the rule can be modified between now and October.
But it's just -- we're having a hard time finding a reason to be optimistic that this ultimately works for us.
Kit if I could just add there's a -- as Rod said there's stated objectives about the reduction stated objectives about the flexibility stated objectives about types of technology and everything and then there's a lot of math behind the rule and we're not sure that the math and the stated objectives all mesh up as well.
But as he said proposed rule through constructive dialog through those sorts of things maybe we get there.
But it's just -- it's kind of drawing that line as Rod said between all those objectives the complexity of the state-by-state issue and then the math that goes behind it that might not support it.
But we're -- it's still early in the process.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right okay.
And then to follow-on on one particular state New York has there been any indication that the folks who matter in New York say at the Governor's Office or other high-ranking officials that the possibility of the carbon implementation has changed their thinking at all or led them to reassess how they think about Indian Point? This is Bill.
I would say at this point we have not seen any -- we haven't had any significant dialogue associated with that.
We've had some conversations with the PSC but I think like us everybody is still in the process of trying to evaluate this and understand how it practically gets implemented.
So it wouldn't be fair to say we've seen a change in their position at this point in time.
And we'll move next to Steven Fleishman at Wolfe Research.
LLC</strong> Leo I know you guys have been a point of view company from as far as I can ever remember but I don't recall kind of initially having the point of view as part of the guidance.
So just when we're thinking about future quarters and periods how are you going to be updating the point of view so to speak just so we -- I'm sure you're updating it somewhat all the time but just as more of like an annual thing quarterly thing how should we think about that? Well I'd say that in continuing with the past practice we are not putting our point of view in guidance.
In continuing with other -- with past practices where we've got it overarching in our decision-making process and in our outlook.
So when we look at guidance with the exception of the fact that I think last year when we are given -- we had to put something in on Lower Hudson Valley and there was no market and so we -- we're clear about imputing that.
Our guidance is inclusive of market not our point of view.
Our outlook of what we think is achievable and where we'll be that's based on what we think is going to happen.
And in a lot of situations that includes an assumption about the price power and that's where we put our point of view in where we think we'll be at that point in time.
But this -- we would distinguish that different from guidance and that's I don't different than our past practices.
As far as how often we'll update that obviously we're going to continue to give you a perspective around where we think we're going to get by 2016 et cetera.
But that we'll probably just do on a quarterly basis and if we're not -- while we update our book every day we don't run all the way through all the financial models everyday all the time.
Hope that helps.
LLC</strong> Yes.
And just one other question on the 2015 earnings consideration slide.
I think all of these were basically things that were in the outlook you gave at the Analyst Day.
Is that correct? There's -- none of these are really new.
No.
I don't think any of these are new Steve.
LLC</strong> Okay.
And your highlight to pension discount rate a couple of times.
Is that just because that's been a volatility item historically? Yes.
I mean as you know it gets set at the end of each year based on interest rates at that particular point in time and so it is uncertain as to what it'll actually become until you get to that point.
The interest rates have been trending down most of the year so there is some risk to that that -- and I know you all are aware of that.
But I want to just -- that's just part of the list.
We want to make sure that you're thinking about all the drivers that we're thinking about.
We'll move next to Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just a quick one on there's been obviously a filing made at the New York PSC around some kind of a contract support for another upstate nuclear plant.
Any -- would you like -- could you comment on that just conceptually and any sort of likelihood or interest in a similar arrangement or request for FitzPatrick? Sure.
Jonathan this is Bill.
Yes we're well aware of the filing that's been made regarding that facility.
Our understanding at this point in time is that is for to meet a short-term reliability need.
As it relates to FitzPatrick we always consider those types of options.
But in general we continue to try to advocate for improved market structures.
Our general thought is that the -- if we have the right market structure which values the attributes of specific generators obviously with nuclear its base load carbon-free generation with on-site fuel that is a much better long-term solution.
However if there are opportunities to enter into other agreements based on certain other needs on the system such as reliability we certainly are open to that but nothing on the table right now.
Research Division</strong> Do you have M&amp;As that these are -- could there be a similar reliability issue to the I guess it's the Rochester one up around FitzPatrick's location? Or less likely in that case? Probably unlikely.
We'll go next to Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates.
I guess just back to the point of view could you give us what you think the reason is that the market is mispricing or is not accurately forecasting the issues that you see coming up in terms of reserve margin et cetera? Sure.
I mean the couple of things you have to remember that I think are constants in what we've talked about for a number of years as is relates to point of view and the forward market is number one is as you look at the forward power markets you got to remember that there's a lot more sellers than there are buyers as it relates to long-dated transactions.
And so while we see very good liquidity in the front end of the curve so obviously for the prompt months and for the next year as you get beyond that you have a lot less natural buyers.
As a result of that probably one of the key drivers in the lower market prices is lower heat rates.
And that's just kind of the situation that we are dealing with and we have been dealing with.
As you get closer to delivery then you will see the markets respond you'll see heat rates increase and you'll see the issues such as the physical constraints that exist in the market -- in the physical delivery market start to come out in the forward market.
And so I can't tie it to any specific issue.
Our belief is that in general infrastructure in the Northeast is going to be constrained.
We're seeing a lot more retirements than we are seeing resource additions.
Therefore we're seeing lower reserve margins.
And as we saw during the polar vortex when you get periods of high peak demand then you see a significant rise in the price of both natural gas and the price of power.
Okay.
And so basically around this time next year -- or by this time next year you would expect the forward curve to come in line.
Is that how we should think about it? Yes we'll see the prompt years...
For 2016.
Yes we'll see the prompt years start to rise.
And as you get closer to delivery then depending on what the actual physical conditions are then you see much more volatility as we did this last winter.
Okay.
And then turning to New York and the legislation which passed the House of Representatives to defund I guess FERC's activity regarding the new capacity zone.
How should we think about a what do you think the likelihood of that passing the Senate would be? And b even if it does pass the Senate what would the practical effect be considering that I think pretty much FERC has already acted on this and acted on the rehearing if I understand it correctly? If you could just sort of elaborate a little bit on that.
Well first let me say that this type of intervention in the markets goes to the very heart of what we're working on from a market structure perspective and is what's actually undermining some of the markets overall when we actually see political motives behind proposed changes that affect that market.
As it relates to this specific appropriations bill we -- it's not currently -- has not been initiated in the Senate at all and our prevailing belief is that FERC has ruled on this.
They've had all the information required to make their decision and we remain confident they will maintain that decision going forward.
Okay.
But I mean if they defund this how would that actually impact FERC? I mean is there -- I mean would it just be simply symbolic? Or would it actually have a practical impact on the capacity zone.
Can you give us a perspective on this [ph]? This is Rod West.
In terms of the actual order that FERC currently has out the rule is in place.
And so the defunding doesn't change the tariff that's ultimately in effect.
You can assume -- and you'd have to ask FERC this whether or not they were specifically defunded whether they would lose the ability to access resources from other sources to actually do their job.
It's opened [ph] a practical matter.
The rule is where it is in the unlikely event and we do not believe that it is a likely outcome that the Senate would carry that amendment.
That's a question for FERC.
But we have to have confidence that FERC's jurisdiction at the end of the day is going to be upheld and supported through the legislative process.
We'll go next to Paul Fremont at Jefferies.
Research Division</strong> Looking at the preliminary 2015 drivers can you elaborate at all on the changes in -- the expected changes in EWC depreciation? Because I guess in 2014 I think your guidance have like a $0.25 increase in depreciation and it looks like you're looking for depreciation to go up yet further in 2015.
This is Drew.
That just relates to normal incremental capital most of it above what we're depreciating right now related to Fukushima and the like.
So that's just normal changes.
Last year Paul you remember that we had that new depreciation study and that's what was driving the larger change last -- from last year to this year.
Going forward we wouldn't expect to see such a large change.
It will just be normal capital increases.
Research Division</strong> And in terms of the useful life of nuclear that assumption is there any type of a major change there? No no changes there.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then in terms of the Department of Environmental Conservation remaining hearings in New York can you give us an idea of when the hearings are expected to end on Indian Point? Sure.
I think you saw a flurry of activity last week regarding this matter where we had a number of politicians business folks community members really speak out against the proposed capacity outages.
Following that the ALJs decided that they were going to push back the hearings associated with that topic for several months that were scheduled to be -- take place in January 2015.
Our point of view on this whole process hasn't really changed since we talked to you at Analyst Day as we don't see any decision occurring on this matter any time before 2016 and likely gets -- may get pushed beyond that.
So our point of view on that's consistent with what we talked to you about at Analyst Day.
Research Division</strong> So 2016 would be the -- an actual DEC final decision? There could be a decision at that point in time.
However remember that as we detailed there's a number of appeals processes et cetera that we would -- we could pursue so that wouldn't be the final word so to speak.
Research Division</strong> Right.
And that would -- that takes you to the 2018 time frame right? Yes sir that's correct.
And we have time for one more question.
We'll take that from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to talk about membership in MISO and just if there's any general timing we should be thinking about in terms of further transmission planning sort of signpost we can look to in terms of the capital that will be required to integrate Entergy into MISO.
Theo do you want to take that? Yes I'll start and maybe others could weigh on this.
But I mean MISO has -- obviously goes through its transmission planning processes.
And as I think as I've talked about at the Analyst Day we talked a little bit about transmission opportunities and I laid out a time line as it related to projects that might have been submitted under MISO's kind of MVP MEP processes.
And August -- the month of August -- August 14 actually is the time when we would see MISO is completing some evaluations of projects that they would consider for their MTEP '14 process.
So we also generally have our typical MISO transmission planning process that you would go through as a part of MISO where we would submit projects reliability projects and that sort of thing.
As we laid out again in Analyst Day I think we said we had about $1.7 billion transmission CapEx through 2016.
Many of the projects that would be reliability-type projects that we would submit through MISO would be part of that $1.7 billion.
But again as you think about other types of projects the MVP projects or other types of projects that might enhance economic benefits you could see potentially spending above that level.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then just shifting gears for a follow-up on Indian Point the coastal zone management process.
What is the earliest date under which the New York State Department of State can make a consistency determination? I know the deadline is at the end of this year.
But what would be the earliest date they could make the decision? Well they could actually make a decision themselves by the end of the year.
However we have reason to believe as based on previous experience that that decision could actually be further delayed.
Remember consistent with our discussion at Analyst Day then that would -- if it was an adverse decision then we would take that to a Secretary of Commerce appeal process which lasts over a year and then there is appeals process is over that -- in addition to that.
So at this point in time everything that we had mentioned at Analyst Day is still correct.
And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.
At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms.
Waters for any closing remarks.
Thank you Audra and thanks to all for participating this morning.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time for introductions and opening comments I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations Ms.
Paula Waters.
Please go ahead ma'am.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] In today's call management will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties is included in the company's SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Thank you Paula and good morning everyone.
As many of you know the Annual Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference is just around the corner so we'll try to keep our comments today relatively brief and save longer-term and more strategic updates for our meetings in Dallas.
I'll start with the bottom line.
Our plan and strategy remains sound and our progress against that strategy is both measurable and clear.
As it often does progress incurs a cost and we saw little of this in the third quarter.
But in fact overall performance for the company was squarely in line with expectations.
We're pleased to report that the utility posted its fifth straight quarter-over-quarter of industrial sales growth and the second straight quarter over 5% exceeding our expectations for the year.
Our nuclear plants operated well.
We had fewer unplanned outage days posting a 90% capacity factor at EWC.
Vermont Yankee entered its final months of operation and as difficult as that decision was we are more confident than ever that it was the right one.
We also made progress on our rate case in Mississippi reaching a constructive settlement with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff one which aligns customer regulator and state objectives with our own.
Let me elaborate a bit on all fronts.
As I just mentioned utility posted quarter-over-quarter industrial sales growth of more than 5%.
As you've heard us say many times this kind of growth isn't by happenstance.
At Entergy we're doing everything we can to drive it.
Doing so requires many things but one is having strong working relationships with the people who serve our utility states certainly our regulators but also state and local policymakers economic development officials and our customers themselves.
Together we've been able to find solutions that work for everyone.
For example in Louisiana this past August we completed cost recovery for damage caused by Hurricane Isaac.
We were pleased that the efficient structure by which we did so allowed us to share the savings with our customers.
Cost recovery of Ninemile 6 begins when the unit comes online through a formula rate plan adjustment mechanism which was part of the Entergy Louisiana rate case settlement approved last year.
We are pleased that the plant which will allow us to better meet the state's growing demand is scheduled to be completed early before the end of the year and under budget.
Partly as a result of actions like these we are in a good position to make the kind of investment our states need to support economic growth even as we keep the cost of power low.
The Mississippi rate case is another great example.
As I just mentioned last month we reached a settlement.
It's true that this settlement requires us to forgo recovery of costs associated with the development of a new nuclear option at Grand Gulf.
It would also allow Entergy Mississippi to maintain a competitive ROE better meet anticipated demand and continue to attract capital on reasonable terms.
Perhaps most importantly by developing the state's transmission infrastructure we believe it will help Mississippi attract industry and create new high-paying jobs.
The MPSC hasn't approved the settlement yet and we don't want to get ahead of either ourselves or the commission but we think it's reasonable and balanced and hope our commissioners will agree.
We expect a decision in December.
Driving growth in our service territory also requires operational and financial discipline.
So in the third quarter we saw progress on another important front.
In a move designed to attract industry and jobs to the state Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana asked the Louisiana Public Service Commission for permission to become a single utility.
Initiatives are different but as in Mississippi combining the 2 companies will make it easier for us to make needed investments in Louisiana power infrastructure MBA-expanded rate options to sustain and propel the state's industrial renaissance.
It will for example allow us to streamline investment by creating a stronger balance sheet.
It will improve our ability to attract capital and it will give us more flexibility.
By 2019 the 2 companies expect up to 1 600 megawatts in industrial load growth.
Both are already making substantial investments to meet demand and replace aging infrastructure which together with other ongoing capital needs will require more than $5 billion in capital investment in generation transmission and distribution by then.
Our business combination proposal to the LPSC reflects significant input from stakeholders across the states in particular our industrial customers.
And we are pleased to see positive feedback from the market.
As some of you may have seen on October 10 Moody's issued a report saying this business combination is credit positive reinforcing our case.
Let me give you just a couple of other highlights from the quarter.
Entergy Texas filed for nearly $7 million in revenue requirements associated with incremental distribution investment under a rider becoming the first Texas utility to do so since legislation was passed in 2011.
The decision is expected early next year.
Some of our biggest customers also made progress.
Big River steel in Arkansas completed financing and broke ground in September.
Cameron LNG in Louisiana also had its groundbreaking just last month.
And last week Sasol announced their final investment decision on the $8 billion investment in the Lake Charles Louisiana area.
Entergy Wholesale Commodities operational performance was once again strong.
As I noted earlier our plants ran well.
For example the extended outage at Fitzpatrick came in below the shorter end of our expectations.
And at VY our employees have kept the plant running for nearly 670 consecutive days now.
Remarkably they are on their fourth breaker-to-breaker run.
And in fact all of our EWC plants play important roles in their respective regions and communities.
Pilgrim provides fuel diversity in a part of the country where infrastructure constraints are most severe.
Without the on-site fuel benefits it provides New England would be even more vulnerable to price volatility.
As I noted a minute ago Fitzpatrick completed its refueling and maintenance outage a very complex undertaking in just 44 days.
A great example of what happens when a solid plan comes together with our employees' tremendous dedication.
And with respect to Palisades although it has a PPA through early 2022 it's long-term post-PPA outlook is improving.
For example the MISO region where it is located has recently seen 3 gigawatts of coal-fired generation retire and another 5-gigawatts is scheduled to retire in the next few years.
So keeping highly reliable sources of baseload power like Palisades online will become even more important.
Let me now to Vermont Yankee since I know a lot of you will have questions about its closure.
As you may know in September the plant began its coast down to permanent shutdown which will occur at the end of the year.
Last month as we said we would Entergy delivered a first-of-its-kind site assessment study to the state of Vermont.
While decommissioning costs articulated in the study are higher than earlier estimates they are more precise allowing us to develop plans with much more certainty.
Under the terms of our agreement with the state of Vermont we had said we would periodically evaluate the cost of decommissioning together with the trust to determine when we would have the resources needed to begin major activities.
Using conservative estimates about growth of the trust we think it will have enough money to begin such activities in the next 25 to 35 years.
At this point we don't expect to add funds into the trust to meet NRC financial assurance requirements.
The decision to close the plant was tough it came with certain risks and challenges but we planned to meet and manage these services thoughtfully which I think we have.
For example we obtained an order from the Vermont Public Service Board authorizing VY to operate through the end of the fourth quarter.
We targeted elimination of overhead associated with the plant and we placed the majority of Vermont Yankee employees wanting to stay with the company in new roles.
It's worth reiterating that this was the right decision.
First we now see an incremental benefit of shutdown versus continued operation of an additional $50 million through 2017.
And second despite the upturn in forward power prices in New England over the past year the economics for VY would still not be sustainable in the long run.
Forward capacity market improvement through the newly defined constrained zones that spans Southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island is improving the revenue outlook at Pilgrim and RISEC but VY would not have benefited from this new capacity zone.
Indian Point also continues to operate safely and reliably.
That plant's importance to the regional electric grid was recently reaffirmed by the New York ISO which confirmed that and I quote "Significant violations of transmission security and resource adequacy criteria would occur in 2016 if the Indian Point plant were to be retired as of that time." As most of you know the state of New York is currently scheduled to determine Indian Point's compliance with the coastal zone management act or CZMA by year-end.
To date we have submitted thousands of pages of information demonstrating that Indian Point operations are consistent with state coastal policies.
There's at least one more environmental impact study the NRC has said it would submit likely late next year.
And we think that that study would be important to complete the record.
We also have 2 other paths for resolution to establish that the NRC does not need this consistency determination to issue a renewed license.
As we have made clear we believe that it does not.
Regardless of the outcome we expect appeals to be filed.
It is also possible that we will take other procedural steps to support our position.
With that said we don't expect license renewal to be decided any time before 2018.
I think we can say with some assurance that while Entergy may differ with some on the future of Indian Point we can all agree that what it offers: reliable baseload power high paying jobs and stable prices that these are attributes that benefit Westchester County New York City and the state of New York as a whole.
And that's why we say that Indian Point is and will remain a critical part of the generation mix of New York and why we are committed to ensuring its continued safe operation.
Finally as we look to winter infrastructure constraints in the Northeast are expected to continue to challenge the region at least for the foreseeable future.
As we've said before various changes in the structure are required to ensure these markets function properly not only with respect to reliability but also economic and environmental sustainability.
Building new capacity is one option but it can be expensive to build any kind of new energy infrastructure whether pipelines or wind farms in the North East.
This past quarter Massachusetts stakeholders would choose support for proposal to recover costs for new gas pipeline capacity via a FERC-regulated electric transmission tariff.
We believe that recovery for this type of investment is better addressed through competitive markets and market-based signals and mechanisms as opposed to being subsidized through a transmission tariff.
Although forward markets indicate these constraints will be partially addressed in the coming years it's unclear when or if projects will actually get built.
In any case it will take time.
So we expect more of these markets to continue to be premium markets for the foreseeable future especially during the winter.
Before I conclude I'd like to note that next week America celebrates Veterans Day in honor of the generations of men and women whose service and sacrificed embody the ideals upon which this country was founded nearly 2.5 centuries ago.
We live in a world in need of heroes.
But at Entergy we get to work with nearly 2 000 people who when their country called they said send me.
They work at our nuclear plants and at utility operations they are line men engineers and accountants.
They sit across the hall or across the table and we are fortunate to call them colleagues bosses and mentors.
Words may never be enough but on behalf of this company to those who served and those who continue to serve and to their families let me just say thank you.
So that concludes the overview of the third quarter.
We'll be seeing many of you in a week or so and I know Drew will expand on this.
So I'll just say that at EEI we plan to address what Entergy is doing to meet the needs of our stakeholders from adding new capacity at the utility to maximizing value at EWC.
Some of you know that I've been in this business for more than 30 years.
It's never easy going.
But for all of us here there has never been more an exciting time.
So today at Entergy we can say that our fundamentals are strong the path forward is clear and most importantly our long-term value proposition remains intact.
Let me now turn the call over to Drew.
Drew? Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
Today I will review the financial results for the quarter provide highlights on how we see 2015 shaping up and preview what we'll discuss at the EEI.
Starting with Slide 2.
Our third quarter results for the current and prior years are shown on as-reported and an operational basis.
Operational earnings per share were $1.68 in the third quarter 2014 compared to $2.41 in 2013.
Operational results excluded special items from the decision to close Vermont Yankee HCM implementation and the transmission spin-merge effort last year.
Turning to operational results by line of business on Slide 3.
Entergy's operational earnings decreased quarter-over-quarter.
One key driver was income tax expense which affected each of the segments.
The effective income tax rate was approximately 40% in the third quarter of this year compared to approximately 25% in the comparable period last year.
Details underlying the income tax expense variance are discussed in Appendix A of our earnings release.
Moving to the segments.
At the utility operational earnings per share were $1.72 in the current period compared to $2.04 in the prior period.
Utility net revenue was higher than last year led by weather-adjusted retail sales growth for the quarter at 2%.
Once again the industrial customer class had the strongest gains at 5.3%.
And as Leo noted this is the fifth quarter in a row for positive industrial growth which was due largely to expansions in the chemicals refining and primary metals segments as well as growth from small industrial customers.
Substantially all of the growth occurred in Louisiana and Texas.
The quarterly net revenue increase also reflected higher price resulting of rate actions a portion of which was offset by other line items.
Sales growth was partially offset by a very mild summer leading to negative $0.11 of weather.
Also OEM was higher quarter-over-quarter.
Benefits from our ongoing cost management efforts were offset by nuclear spending to improve operations as well as other items some of which were offset elsewhere in the income statement.
As Leo noted utility results were also affected by a charge related to the proposed settlement of Entergy Mississippi's general rate case.
The charge reduced current period earnings by $0.23 per share.
Moving on to EWC where operational earnings were $0.23 per share and were lower than the $0.46 earned a year ago primarily driven by income tax benefits in the third quarter of 2013 as well as the depreciation change we have discussed in the past.
EWC EBITDA for the quarter summarized on Slide 4 was $165 million the same as last year.
EWC's O&amp;M was lower compared to the same quarter last year and driven by our cost-management efforts.
While the overall net revenue variance was not significant there were a few important items within that line item.
Third quarter results reflected 37 refueling outage days for the Fitzpatrick plant.
You may recall that that outage was originally planned for the fourth quarter.
The net revenue effect of the refueling outage was partially offset by an approximately 40% improvement in unplanned outage days quarter-over-quarter and a higher average realized price of the nuclear fleet quarter-over-quarter.
Moving on to operating cash flow shown on Slide 5.
OCF was around $1.4 billion in the current quarter up nearly $300 million from 2013.
The primary driver was $310 million in securitization proceeds to reimburse Hurricane Isaac costs.
Before we move on Slide 6 highlights our credit metrics compared to a year ago.
Let me just take a moment to note that we've seen credit improvements across several metrics which shows progress in the right direction.
I'll now turn to forward-looking information.
Today we affirmed our 2014 operational earnings per guidance of $5.55 to $6.75.
Recall that the midpoint was revised upward in April this year by approximately 23% to $6.15 per share from the original guidance midpoint.
Current expectations continue to be on track for the -- round the midpoint of our range but for the unplanned charges associated with the Mississippi settlement.
Similarly as with that charge expectations for the utility continues to be around the $5 midpoint we discussed in April.
Next week we'll see many of you at the EEI's annual financial conference.
In advance of the conference we surveyed some of you in the investment community to get opinions on where we can enhance our communications.
One specific point of feedback was on our practice of pre-releasing earnings.
It was clear that most of you do not find this practice useful.
Therefore going forward we will discontinue it.
You also provided feedback on what you wanted to hear at EEI.
At the conference and on Slide 7 we'll be prepared to talk about 2015.
As you know we will issue our official guidance with supporting details on our fourth quarter call.
The good news is that our current expectations and the street consensus appeared generally aligned based on commodity prices as of September 30 and other factors which I'll discuss now with more details to follow next week.
For the utility we expect weather-adjusted sales growth in the range of 3% to 3.5% to be a significant driver.
Industrial sales are expected to be the major component increasing approximately 6%.
We don't expect actions to have significant earnings impact.
For EWC revenues the capacity in generation table the Table 7 in our release provides details underlying our revenue assumptions.
We also provide our current EBITDA estimate assuming market prices as of September 30 in the accompanying slides.
Because New York's Lower Hudson Valley capacity market is illiquid the table once again utilizes point of view pricing for LHV.
Next year the assumed average price is approximately $6 per kW month per LHV.
Staying with EWC the closure of the Vermont Yankee will affect year-on-year results.
This year VY is expected to contribute approximately $55 million to EWC earnings and approximately $165 million to operational adjusted EBITDA.
Keep in mind the year-over-year impact as the VY closure goes beyond simply removing 2014 earnings.
To this end EEI materials will include information on line item drivers for VY.
Updates on other typical drivers will include interest expense at the utility and depreciation in both businesses resulting from capital investments.
Non-fuel O&amp;M will also be a driver for 2015 and one component is pension expense.
We will not know the final pension assumptions including the discount rate until early next year.
For now we are assuming a pension and OPEB expense increase of approximately $70 million which includes updated actuarial and experience studies as well as a discount rate of 4.75%.
We also expect our overall and utility effective income tax rates to be in the range of 32% to 34% compared to approximately 37% overall this year.
Beyond 2015 we will discuss the longer-term view and we'll roll forward many of our Analyst Day financial outlooks and aspirations by 1 year.
Finally for content we'll cover the utilities growth story which includes robust growth at industrial demand as well as the case for investment opportunities in generation transmission and potentially natural gas reserves.
For EWC we'll focus on its long-term strategy as well as our efforts to improve clarity for Indian Point.
We look forward to seeing you at EEI where you know we'll have a lot to talk about.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Just to sort of a follow-up on the EEI PD with the Vermont Yankee decommissioning.
How should we think about the ongoing expense item associated with that? Can you give us a little bit more before EEI? Yes.
For the next couple of years we expect it to be about a negative $0.20 to $0.25.
And then after that it would trail off to about -- excuse me millions -- sorry $20 million to $25 million of net income impact and that trails off to about $12 million.
I'm sorry...
There are several ups and downs in there.
We'll have the line item drivers for you on a slide at EEI.
Okay.
And then does the change in the Vermont Yankee decommissioning cost in total have any impact on what you guys are thinking about with your other plants? And I recall you guys taking some significant tax positions associated with that.
Could those change as well as a result of your update updated Vermont Yankee decommissioning study? I'll answer the second question first.
No it doesn't affect our tax positions.
And on the first question we did learn quite a bit because we did the detailed study of Vermont Yankee.
But it doesn't change our current expectations for funding or expense at either -- or any of our remaining of nuclear facilities.
And we will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Research Division</strong> So quick question here as you're thinking about New England and all the latest developments what's your fundamental view '15 through '17 on the forward curve? Do you think or is it your expectation to continue to use options to leave some upside there? Yes Julian we plan to continue to use the same hedging strategy we have in the past keeping in mind that there are certain limitations depending on what the market offers.
But -- so we continue to use a number of structured products.
Those structured products change -- a number of counter-parties change but we're still working to maintain that optionality in the book.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then looking at the capacity side of the equation there obviously we've seen a few new newbuild or potential newbuild announcements in the last few months.
How has that if at all changed your expectations or pricing in the subsequent auction? And then specifically are you expecting the SEMA region to breakout separately? And do you have a price expectation therein? Yes.
So we have seen more a lot more activity in terms of proposed projects.
Our expectations on pricing associated with capacity really hasn't changed.
We think that for the rest of pool in England that's still somewhere around an $11 cone.
We do expect ISO New England to put in place the SEMA pricing zone that has -- will hopefully be resolved by the end of this year.
As it relates to pricing in that specific zone where RISE and Pilgrim reside that will depend on the amount of capacity that's actually bid.
I think you're familiar with the rules up there in terms of limitations on capacity pricing for insufficient offers that type of thing.
But we are somewhat bullish in that area but it's going to -- the final pricing will depend on the amount of capacity actually bid in FCA 9.
Research Division</strong> Great.
Just to be make sure I heard you correctly there's a potential for an insufficient capacity in SEMA? Yes.
So with rest of pool there's a slope demand curve.
I don't believe that slope demand curve has been implemented in SEMA so we would revert back to the insufficient competition which would go back to net cone.
And we will take our next question from Neel Mitra with Tudor Pickering.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.
Research Division</strong> I had a question on the New England capacity market as well.
Obviously of the winter reliability program which is kind of a temporary fix do you see anything progressing going forward similar to what PJM is doing with the capacity performance proposal to make sure that there's adequate fuel for the plants in that region or in the winter? Well Neel I think we were hopeful to see that actually change for this winter.
Frankly we were disappointed with the fact that they rolled the existing plan forward a year.
But I believe FERC gave made some pretty clear guidance on that issue for the '15 '16 winter timeframe needs to be addressed.
So we are hopeful that we see some progress there that we move beyond something such as the oil backup reliability to a more market-based approach which properly values all resources that have adequate fuel supply.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And then at your Analyst Day you laid out the kind of the lack of pipeline capacity going into New England.
Has your view changed with maybe some of the bigger projects that are being proposed out that would come on late 2018 early 2019? Or do think that there's still a long shot for a lot of projects that would actually bring gas into New England? I don't think our overall point of view has changed.
You've got the Spectra Northeast Utilities JV you've got the Northeast Energy direct.
And you have to keep in mind that those have not been subscribed.
So we believe that that could be a challenge just given overall economics.
So we believe at least in the foreseeable future nothing is going to change significantly.
We'll continue to see a lot of volatility up in those markets.
And at this point those projects that have been proposed are very questionable from our perspective.
And we would take our next question from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to discuss transmission growth as you join MISO.
I wonder if you could just talk at a high-level.
I know this is an evolving situation but are there certain signposts or upcoming things we should be looking for to get a better sense of what's really going to be required to integrate your system into MISO? Stephen I'll start and I'll let Theo kind of jump in with the details.
From a transmission standpoint we've -- and obviously we'll be giving updated investment opportunities and everything when we get out next week but we still see based on our internal business which is from all reliability projects projects associated with the industrial growth and demand that we see down here projects that will be required when we build or acquire new generating capacity and everything obviously we've had a significant uptick over the last several years on our transmission investments and we would think that continues.
And that is before you get into the idea of what we've got now that we're in MISO.
And there's really 2 broad areas where at least where we see things we're already seeing some things that are there because now we've got a bigger footprint and more generating capacity we have access to that we can count on given the way it's dispatched in MISO plus then there'll be the Order 1 000 issues and then even things that show up to integrate us with -- or MISO with the region.
As far as -- so we do see that there are some opportunities out there that we're already looking at but more to come on that front.
Obviously some of those are farther out in the picture than near-term investments we have in our own system which are pretty substantial.
And Theo I don't know if you want to add to that? Well I mean yes I'll add a little bit to that Leo.
I mean you made a comment in terms of the path about our transmission spending.
I mean if you look back in 2010 we were probably spending somewhere around $280 million or so in transmission.
I think if you go forward we've kind of more than doubled that.
So obviously our level of transmission spending is increasing as it relates to MISO.
MISO does have the study out around their voltage and local reliability and mitigation that could potentially drive transmission investment as well.
We've gone through the MTEP process for 2014.
There were some projects that were identified within that process.
That process will also occur in 2015 and you could see some projects that were proposed in 2014 become part of the 2015 MTEP process as well.
But yes I think one of the major drivers for us may not be so much MISO but as Leo mentioned just the transmission associated with the economic development opportunity that we have.
If you look at our EGSL ELL business combination filing and some of the details and how we talk about some of the opportunities that might require transmission investment within the context of that.
So while there could be opportunities relative to MISO I think we see our transmission opportunities somewhat broader than that.
Research Division</strong> That's very helpful.
I wanted to shift gears to Indian Point.
Of late has there been a dialogue between Entergy and the state over approaches that can be taking compromises et cetera? Or is this playing out primarily in the legal arena? Stephen we've had a number of discussions with various representatives of the state but obviously we continue to aggressively pursue our legal paths.
But I think that's all I can say at this point in time.
And we would take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> You had another really good quarter on the industrial demand side even relative to probably expectation to spring.
How much of that is -- you kind of maybe situational timing relative to what you would've expected.
And at what point in time are you guys going to be in a spot to reconsider that underlying growth trend? Dan I'm not -- this is Theo.
I'm not sure I understand your question in terms of situational.
But yes I think when we look at where we are from an industrial growth perspective in the quarter I think it's coming from where we would somewhat expect it to.
It's primarily coming from expansions in the kind of the petrochemical refinery area.
And that's what we really expect it to be at this point in time.
If you look at one of the slides I'm not sure exactly which number it is on the 1 700 megawatts we laid out at Analyst Day I think in terms of completed and signed projects we're about 300 megawatts.
And so we're really just getting started in that regard.
As it relates maybe to the second part of your question in terms of maybe changing expectations I think we right now we still feel good about the $3.05 to $3.75 earnings growth through 2016.
And while we continue to firm that up in terms of what we see as it relates to the 1 700 megawatts obviously we see movements in we see movements out.
We're still comfortable with that.
The question of multiplier effect the issue of potential energy efficiency impacts on the underlying intrinsic growth we still think about.
But with the puts and takes and ins and outs I think from our perspective we're still comfortable with the $3.05 to $3.75 at this point in time.
Research Division</strong> And I guess correlated to that is the residential load is -- hasn't been nearly as impactful right? And when do you guys see -- or do you see the prospects for kind of the multiplier effect starting to show up in numbers as these projects get done? And what should we be watching from the outside to see more uptake on that side? I don't think we're really seeing the impacts of the multiplier effect at this point.
Again I mean if you look at the slide we've only got 300 of 1 700 megawatts that are signed and completed.
I think if you look at historically other areas where they've experienced I wouldn't say this type of industrial growth because I'm not sure anybody's experienced it in recent history but some type of industrial growth.
Generally the lag that you see in terms of multiplier effect happens maybe within a year couple of years 1.5 years after you really start to see the impact of the industrial growth.
So we're not quite there yet and I think that's still to come.
We'll see more signed than completed projects as we move forward into '15 and '16.
And so I think you'll start to see the impacts of kind of trickle-down the multiplier effect more so '15 '16 time frame.
But again we're also going to continue to see impacts of our energy efficiency programs as those are broad within our service area.
And we would take our next question from Steven Fleishman at Wolfe Research.
LLC</strong> Question just on -- and thinking about the huge industrial growth.
When you're signing contracts up with Cameron or Sasol or these different large customers are you -- is it mainly a demand fixed payment no matter how much the facility runs? Just thinking about -- we don't know if one day these plants if conditions could change they may not run much or less.
Just how are you kind of locking in the risk of that? This is Theo.
I mean clearly there is a demand element to most of our larger industrial contracts and that's probably about as far as I'll go as it relates to that.
A lot of those contractual arrangements differ from customer-to-customer.
There are rate tariffs that are in effect for some of those service contracts.
We also in some cases we get facilities charges relative to the particular customer.
But clearly there's kind of a little bit of a demand-based type element to rate structures when you talk about those types of customers.
LLC</strong> Okay.
As opposed to like a fixed payment? Again and some of it is just contractually specific to the customer.
LLC</strong> Okay okay.
And switching gears and one thing we started hearing from a couple of companies is some interest in looking at E&amp;P reserves as something to put in rate base and maybe it's like a hedge for customers relative to gas prices as they're very low right now.
Given that you guys have a pretty heavy gas fleet is that something you've considered and something that might have interest in? This is Theo again Dan.
It's something that our regulators have historically looked at ways on a hedge volatility of gas -- I'm sorry I meant Steve I'm sorry.
I still had Dan Eggers on my mind for some reason.
And as a matter of fact the LPSC has an open docket right now to look at long-term gas hedging opportunities.
And one such opportunity might be to invest in gas and ground.
And that can provide an economic long-term physical hedge for our customers.
So yes it is something that historically we've had discussions with regulators about and I think we'll continue to have discussions around.
We would take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
So I have question about the growth in regulated earnings because I understand that you're going to be providing us updates during the EEI.
But I was just wondering this write-down of expenses associated with the new nuclear plant.
Does it have any impact on the rate base? And should we have any worries that your former or current growth trajectory for regulated earnings is going to be lowered? I guess Angie I'll answer the question in terms of impacts on rate base.
The asset that was written off was not in rate base in the Mississippi jurisdiction.
So no it would not have any impact on our views of rate base going forward.
It really wasn't I think you used the term plant.
I wouldn't describe it as a plant.
I would really describe it as more of some additional -- some early stage cost associating with permitting and licensing processes as we were looking at new nuclear opportunities in earlier years.
So clearly not a plant that was in service per se and not an element of rate base.
So we'd not expect it to have an impact on our views of rate base growth.
The reason I'm asking -- I'm asking because we're missing the slide that you usually have with the earnings growth for the regulated utilities.
I'm not sure which slide that is Angie but we'll certainly have that for you at EEI.
Okay.
And then my other question so there's been clearly a movement a nominal movement in forward power curves.
Could you give us roughly a sense if we were mark-to-market the EWC's earnings power how much of a change would we see on these bars that you're showing for '15 and '16 EBITDA for EWC? Angie I don't know if I can comment specifically on the dollar value.
I think from our perspective what we see is that for '15 it's in line with our POV '16 maybe slightly lower than our POV and that widens as you move further out in the curve.
So essentially I don't think our point of view has changed much from what we provided you earlier in the year.
And we would take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions.
First of all tax rate going forward you talked about the 32% to 34% for 2015.
Do you view that as a normal number? Or do you see kind of taxes migrating back towards the higher historical level overtime? This is Drew.
So we see it as -- we have -- as we've talked about in the past we have a portfolio of activities going on with the IRS and at the state levels.
And it depends on the timing of audits and things like that.
So next year we see 32% to 34%.
Beyond that I think we are still talking about a statutory tax rates in our guidance and our aspirations and outlooks and those types of things.
So that's where we are for now.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
And on the regulated side 2 questions one with Ninemile.
How significant -- what's the best way to think about what that level of rate increase would be? And when is the earliest you could see that actually go into effect? Michael this is Theo.
I don't -- right off the top of head I don't have specific number as it relates to revenue requirements around Ninemile.
We'll probably have to get that for you later.
But clearly we would expect that any rate change relative to that would go in effect at the time we see the plant coming online.
And I'll just add that we've got lot of AFUDC in the earnings this year and so you're not going to see a big pickup next year when that plant comes online.
It'll be maybe $0.05 or so.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
And last question Mississippi as part of the rate deal and some of the other negotiations with staff in the Public Service Commission are you moving to more of a forward-looking formula rate plan kind of similar to what one of your large neighbors in the state has? Or is that formula rate plan kind of some kind of hybrid or still historical looking? No I think -- again Michael this is Theo what we have arrived at in agreement in the stipulation is an FRP with what we call forward-looking features which does allow us to look forward to some extent to kind of calculate and set what we would view as revenue requirements associated with the period of time in the future.
Research Division</strong> And are there any restrictions on when you can next file to get an FRP-related revenue increase? Not certain.
I'll have to get back with you on that.
I don't -- obviously we're going to operate within the formula rate plan constructs that have been in place in Mississippi for years.
I mean that's what we would expect.
And my recollection is they don't necessarily have specificity as to whether you can get a rate increase.
By the same token that formula rate plan has -- obviously it goes both ways.
You could see rate decreases.
So I'll have to verify that.
But just off the top of my head I don't believe there's any specificity in the stipulation around not being able to obtain a rate increase or on the contrary not necessarily having an -- experiencing a rate decrease.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
And my apologies one last one cash levels at the end of the quarter were actually pretty high.
I mean roughly $1 billion if you just assume short-term investments as well.
Is that just a timing issue in terms of time line of CapEx? Or do you have a greater-than-expected cash balance that you can deploy to either the balance sheet or investment opportunities? This is Drew.
So it was a little bit elevated.
We have a couple of big tax payments coming up I think that's probably part of it.
And we would take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just picking up on something you just said are you saying that you'll -- when you do your guidance you're going to guide to a normal tax rate and you were just sort of mentioning the lower tax number? Or is that sort of going to be a part of 2015 number you guide to? No what I was referring to for 2015 when we provide that guidance on the fourth quarter call we would expect at least as we look at it right now we'd expect the tax -- the effective tax rate reflecting that to be in the 32% to 34%.
As we'd talked about 2016 as an outlook we've been talking -- we've been using a normalized tax rate for that time frame.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So you're not changing your practice in terms of guidance on that front? Right.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And secondly so you just give us -- you gave a number of $70 million on pension and you mentioned the updated actuarial I guess mortality studies and then the discount rate.
How much of the $70 million if you can say has to do with the new actuarial study? Off the top -- it's probably -- I can't remember the exact number but it's around half I think.
I mean roughly half.
We usually give a rule of thumb around interest rates and if you're trying to get to that $70 million increase off of our expectations for pension expense this year you're not going to make it.
And that's why we're talking about that piece.
And we would take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Research Division</strong> I'm all good.
My questions have been answered.
[Operator Instructions] We would take our next question from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Research Division</strong> I'm looking I guess at your Slide 24 which is the EWC EBITDA outlook and it's very close or right on top of the numbers I think that you provided on the second quarter conference call.
But at the time of your second quarter conference call when you were talking about LHV capacity prices you were sort of showing a flattish outlook going into the fall.
This time you're showing a fairly significant decrement.
Is there something to offset the decrement that we should be assuming that are keeping sort of these numbers equal to where they were on the second quarter conference call? And if so what would that offset be? I think we'll have to get back to you.
I don't have that -- honestly I don't have been that in my head Paul in terms of what that reconciliation would be but we can follow up with you on that.
And we would take our next question from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisers.
Just 2 clarifying questions.
Just on Vermont Yankee on the $25 million.
So that we should consider operating earnings? Yes yes we're going to call that operational earnings next year.
There will be some special items associated with Vermont Yankee next year and that related to the decommissioning activities themselves but it will be a small amount and we'll highlight it.
But on an ongoing basis we will be living with the decommissioned facility.
And so we're going switch that to operational.
Okay.
And then also around Vermont Yankee you mentioned I guess in prepared -- I don't know if it's prepared statements but you said that at this point I think you didn't expect any escalation in prices.
And I just want to understand what that meant.
Escalation of contributions to the trust fund is that what you're referring to or...? Exactly.
And what's the definition of -- at this point meaning is that at this point the next 10 years ago or at this point...? Well as we look at where we sit with the trust and the expenses and our financing strategy associated with all of that we believe that we won't need to contribute anything to the trust.
But that is -- we have to still submit here at the end of the year our post shutdown decommissioning activities report to the NRC and then they have to sign off on it.
So as we look at it today we think that we're going to be just fine.
But we still have to go through that process.
Okay.
And one last question.
Just on the pensions on the $70 million.
And I would I guess put the $25 million on Vermont Yankee on that too.
When you did your Analyst Day earlier in the year were these expenses contemplated when you kind of talked about your longer-term outlook? I think the Vermont Yankee mostly was and some of the pension piece was.
But interest rates have fallen further since then.
And so I think the pension expense is probably up a bit since then.
We would take our final question from Mr.
Charles Fishman with Morningstar.
Research Division</strong> Just one question.
Is the -- will the economic development pipeline slide that's cumulative through '16? Will you rolled that forward next year -- or next week? You're talking about the 1 700 megawatts slide? Research Division</strong> Right.
Yes so we've been looking at that particular slide.
We've gotten a lot of questions about how to actually make that more useful.
And so we're rethinking it.
We're not going to update it right now and roll it forward another year because we haven't completed -- it's a '13 to '16 view and so we want get through '14 before we roll it forward.
But we're still trying to figure out how we want to use that slide if at all or if in a different format going forward.
And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.
Ms.
Waters I would like to turn the call back over to you for additional or closing remarks.

Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Release and Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Waters.
Ma'am you may begin.
Thank you.
Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us.
We'll begin today with comments from our Chairman and CEO Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
[Operator Instructions] In today's call management will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties is included in the company's SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Thank you Paula.
And good morning everyone.
Last year we told you that Entergy was in a unique position and that's still true today.
We said we had a significant opportunity to invest in and modernize our fleet strengthen reliability and meet evolving regular expectations and requirements.
We said by making these investments we could both grow our rate base and our keep customer rates low a strategy supported in part by the industrial renaissance here in the Gulf South.
We said we would manage risk and preserve optionality at Entergy wholesale commodities by improving fleet operations and pursuing stability.
We said we'd manage commodity risk and leverage in the inherent volatility of power prices to our benefit and that of our owners.
I'm pleased to say we did all of these things in 2014.
At the Utility we announced the proposed purchase of the Union Power Station which would serve 4 of our operating companies.
In Louisiana Ninemile 6 came online months early and about $70 million underbudget.
We resolved 2 important rate cases in Mississippi and Texas.
And in Arkansas while we are not where we need to be we were granted limited relief in our request for a rate case rehearing.
We completed our first full year of operation in MISO.
And it's becoming clear that our projections that customers would realize savings were correct validating our regulator's decision to approve that move.
Although the numbers are still estimates it now appears that customers across the Utility will in fact realize more MISO-driven savings than we had originally expected.
We did all these while keeping our rates low about 20% below the national average across all of our customer classes.
For the year we beat our original 1.9% retail sales growth projections by 0.4% coming in at 2.3%.
Industrial sales led the way with 5% growth beating our estimates of 2.8% by a wide margin.
At EWC we improved operations at our plants which even during the coldest days of the polar vortex we're able to provide customers with safe reliable power.
And we made significant investments at our Fitzpatrick plant to strengthen reliability even further.
At Indian point we received an important favorable ruling on CZMA from the New York State appellate court and we continue to engage New York State agencies when appropriate and possible.
And particularly in the first quarter during periods of market volatility our risk management and hedging activities delivered substantial value for our owners.
EWC's strong first quarter coupled with that of the utility resulted in operational EPS growth of nearly 9% for the year well above the original guidance we provided in the fall of 2013.
All of these things led to Entergy capturing a top quartile position on total shareholder return in 2014.
We believe this performance illustrates our commitment to what has been our mission for some time creating sustainable value for our owners customers employees and the communities that we serve.
As we look to 2015 and beyond we can say with confidence that the fundamentals driving our business are intact.
Of course we know that our company faces some challenges in the coming year.
And these challenges including the drop in power prices underlay our announcement this morning on 2015 guidance.
But Entergy remains on track to deliver on its objectives.
Our strategy remains sound and you will continue to see us execute on it this year and in the years to come.
Let me start our discussion about the Utility by saying we continue to believe that today Entergy has some of the best growth fundamentals in the business.
We continue to see a need make productive investments to meet increasing reliability requirements and to modernize our fleet.
We enjoy and are working hard to strengthen recovery mechanisms that give us the financial flexibility to make these investments.
Again we expect to do so while maintaining our rate advantage both through actions we've taken and despite the drop in oil prices through the continued expansion of our industrial customer base.
2014 provided ample evidence to support this point of view.
Let's start with productive investments and the recent actions we have taken.
On December 9th we signed an agreement to acquire Union Power Station near El Dorado Arkansas.
While the agreement is subject to regulatory approval from 3 of our operating companies buying this natural gas-fired nearly 2 000-megawatt facility helps us modernize our fleet and positions our operating companies to meet growing demand including from industrial customers.
In Arkansas and Louisiana similar to prior acquisitions these filings also include proposals for timely rate approvals.
In Texas we filed for CCN Certificate of Convenience and Necessity and plan to file a rate case in the second quarter to incorporate the Union Plant and rates upon closing.
In Louisiana for the first time in nearly 30 years the Utility added a self-build power plant in its fleet.
We're happy to say that Ninemile 6 in Westwego began commercial operations in the MISO market on December 24.
This plant provides value to our customers and to our community and is already fully reflected in rates.
In addition in early June we announced plans for a major transmission build in southwest Louisiana.
The Lake Charles transmission project with investment of an estimated $187 million will be one of the largest transmission projects in Entergy history.
Again our aim here is to strengthen reliability and support economic development that is already occurring in one of the fastest-growing regions in the country.
I'll move now to the regulatory arena where we also made significant progress.
In Mississippi we received more clarity in early December when the MPSC approved a rate modernization plan which includes as you know a 10.07% benchmark ROE as well as provisions to strengthen our financial position for making investments.
Importantly and also in Mississippi we began implementing the state's first ever utility-owned solar project which will include the installation of 3 500-kilowatt ground-mounted solar arrays.
Not a huge project but it's an important way to gauge the viability of solar energy in the state and for us it's also a good example of how Entergy and our commissioners can work together to find common ground.
In Texas we were the first utility in the state to take advantage of a distribution cost recovery rider.
We also had 2 transmission lines CCN approved and we filed another for a total investment of approximately $166 million.
In Arkansas the APSC recently ruled to allow us to recover via retail rates FERC ordered System Agreement payments.
100% of the $71 million requested last year was approved in the PCA rider.
And just last week we notified the Arkansas commission that we will be filing a rate case in the next 2 to 3 months.
We believe this rate case filed will have a positive outcome and give us the financial flexibility to invest in and strengthen our Arkansas portfolio which in turn should go a long way in helping to drive economic growth and job creation.
As you've heard me say before constructive engagement with our regulators in Arkansas has been a top priority for us.
We think we have an opportunity to strengthen our efforts in this regard and now it's up to us to do just that.
In New Orleans ENOI and the city council's advisers reached an agreement in principle.
This agreement would allow securitization of the amount necessary to establish a $75 million storm reserve.
It would also allow recovery of nearly $32 million in capital costs associated with the Hurricane Isaac restoration.
Funds from this securitization are expected in May of 2015 and will give Entergy New Orleans the financial resources to restore services if and when another storm hits.
In Louisiana the LPSC approved an accelerated gas pipe replacement program to among other things replace about 100 miles of pipe over the next 10 years.
The commission also approved a rider for recovery of approximately $65 million in investment over 10 years.
Rider recovery will be adjusted quarterly to reflect actual investment incurred for the prior year quarter.
Finally as I said earlier we expect to see the industrial renaissance continue.
Overall we see retail sales growth estimates of 3.25% to 3.75% through 2017.
Drew will be giving you more detail about this in a minute.
Entergy Wholesale Commodities also had a strong year capped by a quarter with some important positives.
The plants are operated well and we made progress on the license renewal of Indian Point.
As most of you know a New York State appellate court ruled that Indian Point is grandfathered under the New York Coastal Zone Management Program; as such exempt from CZMA review.
If permission to appeal is denied or the ruling upheld a new CZMA determination would not be required for license renewal.
We also negotiated the standstill agreement with the New York State Department of State which provides parties a period of about 6 months to discuss our recent withdrawal of the CZMA application.
While we remain confident in our legal position to withdraw this application the agreement is notable because it is evidence of the progress we've made in engaging in constructive discussions with New York State agencies.
As we have consistently said Entergy remains open to discussing a potential settlement that is fair and considers the interest of all parties.
We continue to work through the license renewal process for Indian Point a plant that supplies on average 25% of the power to New York City and the Westchester County area and one that the New York ISO acknowledges as an essential part of the state's generation portfolio.
We also continue to believe Indian Point will operate well into the next decade.
Another item of note in the fourth quarter was Vermont Yankee which came offline safely and as planned on December 29.
Remarkably it did so following its fourth breaker-to-breaker run.
During what was often a difficult time through hard work and dedication our VY employees delivered an extraordinary year.
At Entergy we often say that we're lucky to work with the best in the business and there can be no better evidence of this than our people at Vermont Yankee.
And for that they have our sincere thanks.
The VY closure also highlighted market design flaws.
And while we can't say these flaws were the sole cause of the closure it nonetheless brings into stark relief unintended consequences that unviable market design can have.
Fortunately we're seeing some progress on fixes to capacity markets.
And certainly the infrastructure constraints in the Northeast are attracting more attention.
If these attention translates to sound policies that address these issues we think that would be good for everyone.
One thing you'll be hearing about this year is energy price scrimmage.
Basically today some ISO market rules and algorithms can affect suppressed prices by not allowing the full cost of the marginal unit to set the clearing price.
In the long run this will lead to unwarranted plant retirements resulting in higher cost and more volatility in price and ultimately degradation reliability.
And that won't be good for anyone.
I'll end our EWC discussion with a note on our hedging strategy which is proving so successful in the past.
While we strive to hedge with asymmetric upsides take advantage of our bullish point of view and market volatility our hedging portfolio as reflected in our quarterly price subsidy charts does carry some downside price risk.
Moving forward we will continue to position our portfolio to capture market upside while maintaining downside risk protection always considering product availability hedging costs and market liquidity.
Overall we think EWC has one of the best merchant portfolios in the country.
Not only are our plants safe and well run operating at high-capacity factors with few unplanned outages.
But as we saw last year all of them played a critical role in their respective regions.
We also believe the EWC fleet is well positioned for growth in part because we see improving fundamentals over time including power prices and a constructive outcome on Indian Point.
And we intend to continue to strengthen these fundamentals through our own actions including disciplined hedging risk management as well as diligently managing the processes for the continued safe operation of our facilities.
So again Entergy had a strong year.
But as proud as we are of that success it's in the rearview mirror.
We are now focused on the road ahead and achieving our 2015 goals.
First and foremost excellence in safety and operations.
We were pleased that River Bend received its first-ever rating of excellence compared with peers joining both Indian Point and Waterford 3 in that category.
This is an accomplishment that reflects our employees' years of hard work and commitment.
We need to make sure that this level of excellence is maintained and expanded.
At the Utility we expect to deliver on our significant investment in construction opportunity even as we work to find new ways to benefit current and potential customers.
I'll note that this includes deployment of renewable energy.
In 2015 we will be taking additional steps to assess its potential cost and performance at several of our operating companies.
And in order to meet evolving customer needs and expectations we will also look for opportunities to incorporate new ideas and technologies working to ensure that we are able to earn our full allowed ROEs in the coming years.
And the across the Utility also continues to be a priority.
Another objective is to receive approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to combine Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana into a single utility.
This move will make it easier for us to make needed investments in the state's power infrastructure; and via expanded rate options sustain and propel the state's industrial renaissance.
At EWC we will continue to focus on positioning the portfolio to unleash its full value and this certainly includes advancing license renewable efforts at Indian Point.
We will continue to advocate for sensible policy frameworks that recognize the value of our merchant fleet from environmental to reliability which we believe will benefit not only our company but also the customers and communities we serve.
And finally all of these actions will support job creation and economic growth in every state region and community where we do business.
This includes substantial support for schools and universities as well as workforce training programs so opportunity is shared with as many as people as possible.
This is a priority for us.
You'll be hearing more about progress against each of these objectives in the months to come.
Let me conclude with a couple of important points.
Today as you heard me say Entergy has an opportunity to position our service territory for the future.
This means modern more efficient plants infrastructure that is even more reliable than it is today and the incorporation of new and emerging technologies.
For us this opportunity translates to investment particularly over the next 3 to 5 years.
To reiterate and as we saw in 2014 we have a compelling capital plan a regulatory environment that by and large allows us the financial flexibility to deploy it and sales growth that supports growth both keeping -- both by keeping rates low.
And in the end this business is a long-term play.
So while short term and even mid-term volatility is a fact of life as we look to 2015 and beyond it that should not distract us from this company's strong fundamentals sound strategy and unique opportunity.
And with that I'll turn it over to Drew.
Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
Today I will review the financial results for the quarter as well as highlights from the full year.
In addition I will discuss the 2015 operational earnings guidance which we initiated today and review our 2017 financial outlook.
Starting with Slide 2 our fourth quarter results for the current and prior years are shown on an as reported and operational basis.
Note that operational results exclude special items from the decision to close Vermont Yankee HCM implementation and the transmission spin-merge effort terminated in 2013.
Operational earnings per share were $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2014 lower than the dollar per share earned in 2013.
Results by line of business are summarized on Slide 3.
Starting with Utility operational EPS was $0.61 per share in the current period compared to $0.86 in the prior period.
The Utility continued to realize volume improvement with 2.4% weather-adjusted retail sales growth.
Excluding the effects of weather higher volume contributed about $0.03 per share to the quarter's net revenue increase.
The industrial customer class had the strongest gains at 6.7%.
About a third of the industrial growth came from the large chemical segment which increased 11% quarter-over-quarter mostly due to the expansion of the core alkali -- of the ag core alkali customer.
We also had solid growth of 4.3% from our petroleum refining customers while sales to small industrial customers increased 3.3% as regional producers continue to benefit from a stronger national economy.
Higher price contributed approximately $0.14 per share a portion of which was offset by the other line items.
Despite the net revenue growth Utility results declined due largely to 3 drivers.
First nonfuel O&amp;M was higher as benefits from our cost management efforts were offset by higher nuclear spending to improve operations timing of Basel spending and other increases such as MISO administrative fees which were offset elsewhere in the income statement.
Next we recorded a $0.06 per share write-off because of regulatory uncertainty associated with the resolution of the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement prudence review.
Finally the Utility's effective income tax rate was higher due to benefits recorded in 2013.
Moving onto EWC operational earnings per share of $0.39 were lower than the $0.48 earned a year ago.
The low EBITDA 2 key drivers were a higher effective income tax rate and lower realized earnings on decommissioning trusts.
EWC EBITDA for the quarter summarized on Slide 4 was $183 million a $50 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2013.
Increased net revenue was the main driver due primarily to the effects of mark-to-market activity.
Similar to 2013 we had sales that did not qualify for hedge accounting.
Unlike 2013 market price moved down after those sales were executed and resulted in a positive mark-to-market gain in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The net revenue increase was partially offset by the gain on the sale of the District Energy business in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Briefly moving to operating cash flow shown on Slide 5 OCF was around $1 billion in the current quarter about the same as 2013.
Now I'll review the full year results starting on Slide 6.
On an operational basis 2014 earnings per share ended the year at $5.83 up from $5.36 in 2013 and above our original guidance midpoint of $5.
The largest driver for the year was top line growth at EWC and Utility.
EWC earnings benefited from improved operating performance as well as our hedging strategy which as Leo noted provides upside opportunity in a higher-priced environment while balancing operational credit risk.
Utility net revenue reflected rate actions and sales growth including the effects of weather.
The overall company net revenue growth was partially offset by several items including a higher effective income tax rate Utility write-offs and the 2013 gain on the District Energy sale.
On Slide 7 and staying with the full year view EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA increased almost $400 million year-over-year due mainly to the higher net revenue discussed earlier.
Our full year operating cash flow performance is summarized on Slide 8.
OCF was about $3.9 billion in 2014 up $700 million from the prior period.
The primary full-year drivers are higher net revenue and receipt of proceeds to reimburse the Louisiana operating companies for Hurricane Isaac's costs.
I'll now turn to forward-looking information.
Slide 9 summarizes our 2015 operational earnings guidance which we are initiating today with a midpoint of $5.50 and a range of plus or minus $0.40.
Our guidance range reflects 2 key updates as we talked you at EEI about our expectations for 2015.
First of all we're now using forward price curves as of December 31 which are lower than the September 30 forwards available at EEI.
Since EEI our revenue estimates for EWC's nuclear fleet have come down approximately $0.65 per share including $0.13 for mark-to-market activity.
Secondly we have continued to evaluate our income tax positions and our midpoint now reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.
This change is driven by additional anticipated benefits at Utility compared to expectations last fall.
The precise timing of these benefits is uncertain but our best estimate right now is this will be more backend-loaded in the year.
Other less significant updates largely offset.
Now I'll cover a few highlights of each of the business segments.
Starting with the Utility the guidance midpoint is $5.70 per share.
Net revenue continues to be an important driver and sales growth accounts are approximately half of the $0.55 net revenue increase.
Our guidance midpoint reflects 2.7% weather-adjusted retail sales growth in 2015 including 4.4% growth for the industrial class.
A portion of the growth percentage change is due to 2014 industrial sales that were higher than we expected as well as continued refinement of our 2015 estimates driven in part by timing adjustments meeting some customers with delays and some with slower ramp ups.
We also updated some customer-specific forecasts for recent utilization trends.
In addition the net revenue increase reflects expected rate changes.
But as we noted last quarter we don't see regulatory price changes having a material year-over-year bottom line impact.
Below net revenue Utility O&amp;M will increase because pension expense is now estimated to be higher than we anticipated at EEI due primarily to a lower discount rate of 4.27%.
The pension expense changed since EEI increased the Utility O&amp;M by approximately $0.06 per share.
For taxes the Utility midpoint reflects an approximate 23% effective income tax rate in 2015.
Now let's turn to the EWC.
EWC's 2015 operational earnings guidance midpoint is $0.70 per share.
We've isolated the year-over-year earnings contribution of Vermont Yankee and is now expected to decline approximately $0.20 per share.
This different than our expectations at EEI of about $0.40 per share due to lower fourth quarter prices in 2014 and more earnings on the decommissioning trust as we rebalanced to a more conservative stance during the first phase of decommissioning.
Another driver in EWC's 2015 guidance is higher nonfuel O&amp;M including higher pension and OPEB expenses as well as the maintenance outage at RISEC and our CCGP in Rhode Island.
Our 2017 outlook is summarized on Slide 10.
The Utility outlook for operational earnings of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion remains on track.
The foundation for the Utility's growth outlook is a capital investment plan which is largely unchanged since EEI.
The next important assumption for the Utility sales growth which we anticipate will continue to be robust for 2017.
Our current estimate for the full-year compound annual growth rate off a 2013 base year was around the low end of the range provided at EEI.
Now that 2014 results are in the books we are updating that disclosure to 3.25% to 3.75% 3-year compound annual growth rate through 2017 off the 2014 base year and reflecting continued refinement of our expectations.
For EWC we have an EBITDA outlook of $650 million to $700 million in 2017.
As you know market prices are volatile.
And based on December 31 prices we would not be in that range.
However based on of our point of view we continue to believe that we can meet our EWC EBITDA expectations for 2017 although we are at the lower end of those expectations today.
Our 2017 outlook for Parent &amp; Other is unchanged as well.
Slide 11 provides a view of the contributions to Utility growth by key industries expanding in our service territory.
Over the last several months we've seen steep declines in oil prices and many of you have asked us about the potential impact to our sales growth outlook.
There will be some effect on our state economy particularly on Louisiana and Texas businesses that supports the oil and gas services industry.
However the outlook to our core growth large industrials remains robust.
Key growth segments in the chemical sectors are largely unaffected by oil price decline such as ammonia chlor-alkali and industrial gases.
Primary metals and wood products are also largely unaffected.
These industries rely on low energy costs in a growing economy to be successful.
Other second order impacts could begin to impinge on petrochemicals but we've only seen a couple of minor delays to date and our customers remain committed to completing the multiyear projects they have started.
We have seen some pullback in specific sectors like gas-to-liquid facilities which compete directly with crude based on production or pricing.
While we would note that although the gas spreads remain robust prices are at lower levels with increased volatility which has caused some of our customers' investment decisions to be delayed.
Still these customers are not key to our growth expectations through 2017.
In fact through 2017 the vast majority of our anticipated new or expanding large industrial customers have passed their final investment decisions or they are under construction.
As Leo said 2014 was a good year but it's now in the past and we still have a lot ahead of us.
We understand that a lot has changed in the last few months and we know that a lot can happen between now and 2017.
However based on what we know today we believe that the utility's long-term growth proposition is intact and achievable.
We will execute the capital plan and upgrade our infrastructure to better serve our existing as well as our new customers.
At EWC we will manage around the volatility that is inherent in that business and we'll work towards additional clarity on Indian Point which give us strategic flexibility.
And we will continue to focus on safety and operational excellence throughout the company.
We know we have new challenges and we are excited about meeting them.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Weinstein of UBS.
Research Division</strong> It's Julien here.
So I wanted to just dig in to the guidance a bit further here.
Can you expand -- and I know you alluded to it already but what exactly is driving the tax changes? Can you elaborate here a little bit? And what do you think about a normalized tax rate would be in subsequent years or just kind of in a generic year? Julien this is Drew.
That's a good question.
The -- if you look back over the last 5 years we have had an operational effective tax rate in the range of what we're talking about.
I think corporate-wise it's been about 26% and at Utility it's been about 23%.
So what we're talking about is not unusual in that regard.
And as we look forward this year -- we'll usually talk about these things.
We talk about a portfolio of opportunities and it's still certainly no different now.
And we have a portfolio of opportunities that we're looking at in 2015.
And by laying it all out this year upfront we're trying to give you better view of what we expect this year.
Beyond 2015 certainly our expectations continue to be that we will look for opportunities because that is one of the largest items on our income statement.
But just to make sure that we are all clear about what the underlying business expectations are we haven't -- we put statutory tax rates in for '16 and -- or our '17 outlook that we rolled forward today.
So as far as 2015 goes like I said it is a portfolio of opportunities.
We have a number of cases that are rolling forward with various tax authorities and it's based on what our expectations are today.
Certainly nothing is guaranteed in that because there are ongoing discussions but that's the best estimate that we have today.
It could be higher or lower than that by the end of the year.
Research Division</strong> And just relative to the initial guidance you kind of laid out there at the time of EEI what exactly changed? If you could elaborate briefly.
I think it just has to do with some of our expectations about what's going to transpire particularly towards the end of the year.
And our desire to make sure that our investors were fully informed about what the possibilities could be rather than get surprised even if it's an upside at the end of the year.
We certainly didn't want to land that in your lap as a surprise.
Research Division</strong> Great excellent.
And then just cutting back to the other side of the house here on the EWC front what are you thinking about sort of -- or what gives you confidence rather in still having kind of a long-term bullish perspective? Obviously you have a view of '17 what are you seeing out there? Is it capacity is it energy? I mean could you elaborate a little bit? Sure Julien.
This is Bill.
A couple of things.
In the long run as we look at gas supply obviously we're seeing a huge cut back in drilling.
So we think that eventually that will have an impact a bullish impact on natural gas prices.
As it relates to heat rates we think that those are also undervalued in the market.
As you think about the number of shutdowns either economic shutdowns or shutdowns due to environmental reasons we remain bullish on heat rates.
And we are seeing some positive changes in the capacity markets such as what we -- what was evidenced recently this week up in New England.
Our next question is from Dan Eggers of Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> If I just kind of have a look at what you guys did in 2014 and you look at the 2015 at the Utility level right if we back out the beneficial tax rate '14 being pretty close to statutory '15 being much lower it looks like your earnings are a lot closer to flat year-on-year.
And I know there's always going to be moving parts but how should we think about earned ROEs this year for '15? And then '16 '17 how you get to your earned ROEs if that tax rate does normalize? I'll take a first crack at this and then Theo can jump in.
And I'll let Theo talk about ROEs.
I'll talk about the big drivers for the earnings blocks as -- particularly as we move forward.
So I think you're right.
In terms of '14 to '15 we're not seeing substantial growth because we don't have a lot of rate actions.
But as you look forward certainly this year we have some significant investment opportunities.
We're talking about like Union Power and those kinds of things that we expect to come on at the end of the year as well as rate opportunities within Arkansas and Texas.
And those are going to be the main drivers.
They're going to push us forward to sort of 2016 2017 time frame.
And I'll let Theo talk about the ROEs in particular.
Hey Dan this is Theo.
I mean I think when you look at '15 ROE I think you're going to see ROE that's slightly below 10%.
Not much different from '14 I think as you somewhat illuminated on.
But I think as you go forward through '16 and you look at the things Drew just mentioned earlier sales growth the fact that the Union purchase goes into -- planted into rates in 2000 -- I mean the spend it goes in the rates in 2016.
And also you see some changes relative to some of our O&amp;M level pension cost I want to mention you'll see those ROEs start to move as we have said many times at EEI and other venues in that 10% to 11% range in 2016.
As you look at the various operating companies we see ourselves making constructive progress at Arkansas as it relates to moving towards the allowed ROE as a result of our 2015 plan rate case and other actions in Arkansas.
The growth that we see in Louisiana will move our Louisiana utilities.
I think when you look at it on a combined basis you'll see that company at -- within its earnings band range based on 9.95% allowed ROE.
And I think as you look to Mississippi New Orleans we see those companies also earning at their allowed ROEs when they get into the 2016 timeframe.
Texas gets closer.
We see growth in Texas as well.
And also we would -- because of the Union acquisition we'll have a rate case in Texas to move forward with that.
And so we'll see some -- likely see some rate change in Texas as well.
So all of that as you look across the jurisdictions we move closer -- to those that aren't at that point today they move closer to get to their allowed ROE.
And overall as we've said over the past few months when you say Utility business that's in the 10.11% ROE range.
Research Division</strong> So I guess -- but if you think about kind of next year and beyond effectively the $0.95 of tax that you have presumably could go away next year.
You're thinking of the Texas case the Arkansas case and putting Union in the rate base should more than compensate for that headwind.
Is that the way if we're going to simply balance things out? Yes I think you'll see the rate actions.
And again as well as I think we'll see some O&amp;M impacts as well as we go into '16.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I just have one dumb question.
If the discount rate stays at the same level as it ended last year what happens to pension expense beyond 2015? Is it a catch-up year? Or would it stay at these levels that would be a flat year-on-year comp? No that's an excellent question.
No It's an actually -- it would go up.
So we build our forecast with interest rate increases as the market tells us in mind.
And we -- mark-to-market if you will.
It's not exactly like a mark-to-market but it's similar.
And so we're anticipating interest rate rises which would mean lower pension liabilities which will mean lower pension expense.
And so right now we are anticipating in 2017 a 5% discount rate on our pension liability.
And as I mentioned that 4.27% is where we ended the year.
So that would be somewhere in the neighborhood of about $0.20 of earnings -- $0.20 $0.25 of earnings per share impact if we were sort of flat to where we are today versus our expectations for 2017.
[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.
Just on the 2015 guidance you guys mentioned that there's an increase in depreciation and decommissioning for 2015.
And you talked about it I just wondered if you could just review that a little bit in terms of what's driving the increase in depreciation expense and decommissioning at the wholesale business at the nonregulated business.
Okay this is Drew.
So I mean I think it's due to just normal activities.
The depreciation is the higher -- the capital investment that we've made at EWC in 2014.
And then the decommissioning expense is as we get closer to the end of these lives particularly as you shorten up your expectations the decommissioning expense is going to rise naturally as you go out that direction.
So I think it's just the normal expectations based on capital investment and shortening life of the assets.
With the capital investment that you're making the actual plant value of the nuclear plant is increasing as the lifespan of the plant is decreasing is that correct? Certainly from a GAAP accounting perspective that you're seeing a large -- you're growing the asset base right now.
And it is -- as you are getting to a shorter life expectancy you are having that greater depreciation yes.
And we should expect that to continue going forward? Yes.
I mean like -- last year I think or maybe 2 years ago we did a depreciation study to try and balance it out a little bit so it's less dramatic than it would have been before.
But certainly we -- you will see some of that still going forward yes.
Our next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to discuss hedging strategy from here.
And just given the environment that we're in and your point of view would you want to be a bit more cautious in terms of hedging in the expectation of improving heat rates et cetera? Or how do you think about sort of your hedge philosophy at this point? Steven this is Bill.
Well absolutely we think about that.
So given the point of view that we just discussed earlier as we look into the outer years we want to be very careful about the products that we use so that we -- not necessarily really interested in a lot of fixed-price products at this point in time.
So we look to move more towards structured products that have that asymmetric upside.
Obviously that depends on a lot of things -- counterparties cost of the products et cetera.
But we are carefully looking at that strategy as we speak specifically as it relates to 2016 and '17.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just shifting to Indian Point specifically.
There is a recent -- I think it's a state ruling regarding -- just the hearing process around a potential summer shutdowns to protect fish in the Hudson River.
Could you give us a sense of just procedurally the process through which that hearing will take place just so we can try to focus on next steps in understanding that process? Sure.
That ruling just did come out this week.
So kind of from a high-level perspective by February 20 Riverkeeper and the staff needs to make some recommendations as it relates to specifically what thinks it would like to recommend in terms of the outages that will go through the normal discovery process.
Probably more of us throughout the summer.
And then in the fall we will actually have a hearing on the issues of outages and then hope to get you some initial reply briefs by the end of the year.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then in terms of after the reply briefs what would be the step back after that? Well depending on what happens there then you would work through an appeal process et cetera.
To kind of sum it up Stephen we think this process probably goes on for several years before you get any final determination.
Research Division</strong> Oh I see.
So there could be a decision late in the year or early next year but then there would be -- there could be various appeals after that? That's correct.
Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> One quick question on -- when you gave the sensitivity on interest rates and the discount rate just now on the pension I think it was $0.20 impact on 2017 if the discount rate increase did not materialize.
Is that a holistic estimate including your exposure to short-term debt? Or is that just the pension? That was just the pension.
And I was trying to do math on the fly trying to widen my range out a little bit.
But I think $0.08 is our rule of thumb on 25 basis points.
So $0.20 to $0.25 is probably a better estimate for that.
But yes it doesn't include interest rate offset.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And the second point was I just -- I was curious on your -- I mean you have the slides with the '17 point of view but you also have '18 '19 disclosures in Table 7 of the release.
Can you share with us what capacity price was embedded in that for the auction that just happened? Is it...
Are you talking about -- for ISO New England? Well for ISO New England...
Research Division</strong> Yes.
I guess I think it wasn't updated overnight but it must have -- might have been your point of view that was in there.
Yes I think it is our point of view.
So you know that the option results for those Pilgrim and RISE came back for the CMA zone at about $11.08 a kW-month for that option.
Research Division</strong> Right.
So is that what was in your table here? I think it's fairly close to what we had.
I mean I think we had talked about that.
We anticipated it would be net cone [ph].
Our next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Can you talk to us a little bit about your plans in Arkansas? You've hinted at times about trying to seek legislative relief.
Just trying to think about the timing of trying to do that? And what type of relief or what type of mechanisms you'd like to seek versus the timing and process for a potential full-blown rate case there? Yes Michael this is Theo.
And I guess I'll start with we believe in Arkansas we started from a common goal with those that are in state we believe with commissioners as well as state and local officials which is really about attracting jobs supporting economic development growth and regional prosperity in the state.
When you think about legislative actions that we've talked about I think we said this before the legislature is currently in session now in Arkansas and any legislative actions would clearly go through the legislative process within the current session.
In terms of the different -- what may be a part of that I think as we said before we would be looking at mechanisms that would align Arkansas with some mechanisms we see in other jurisdictions across our service area.
Things like for instance FRP.
FRPs may be similar to what we've seen in Mississippi that has various forward-looking elements that recently came out of the Mississippi case.
And also I think one thing we would look to try and address in Arkansas is really given the commission some criteria other than kind of a simple DCF method to determine ROE.
I mean really this is really about giving the commissioners some I'd say more tools in our toolbox and really giving them various options they can look at again in a different way in Arkansas that would help us help achieve the common goal that I talked about earlier.
So with the legislative session going on from a timing perspective I would expect that we'd follow some legislation around this and around these various components in the next few weeks in Arkansas.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
So we should probably think that any rate filings wouldn't happen until after the legislation -- legislative session closes? So kind of thinking about a midyear case that implies a midyear 2016 revenue change.
Well I think if you look -- I mean as Leo mentioned in his opening comments that we did provide notice that he would file a case in Arkansas I believe in 60 to 90 days.
So -- and we did that at the end of January.
If you count from that point in time you're sometime in the March April time frame in terms of filing a case.
And given the statutory timelines in Arkansas that would probably put you with if I'm doing my math correctly in my head a rate-effective timeline somewhere at the beginning potentially of 2016.
Our next question comes from Charles Fishman of MorningStar.
Research Division</strong> Leo you made comments concerning the way the board would look at the dividend in 2016 at EEI.
If I take Slide 10 on your 2017 outlook the way I understood those comments at EEI I should look at the Utility net income your outlook less Parent &amp; Other.
And it appears to me you're probably by '17 you're getting closer to the payout range you want to be in.
Is that a fair assessment that the board -- in the way the board would look at it? Yes.
When we -- I think even when we were talking back at EEI the view is that we'll start to have the conversation with the Board when we start to look at '16 and '17's results.
If you look at -- and you're exactly right.
What we are talking about is the payout ratio around Utility combined with Parent &amp; Other as the dividend paying entity that we would be looking to excluding EWC of course given the volatility associated with that kind of business.
But as we start to look at what '16 and '17 hold and what those combined earnings would be we think that that's where the conversation begins with the board.
As we've mentioned a lot of factors will go into that in addition to just what those earnings levels are.
So for example the investment profile what's going to happen in terms of our investments in the Utility in 2016 and '17.
And if it make sense to reinvest versus the dividend raise dividend because we have the growth path there.
So you're right about the metrics.
You're -- and like I said the timing would show up right around as we look at the '16 and '17 earnings profile.
Our last question is from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.
Just a few questions.
I'll keep it to 2 2.5.
Just back on the taxes I guess the concern I have that it is about $0.90 of earnings power.
So if you kind of back that out '15 actually looks kind of weak.
And so I just kind of want to understand your thinking on that and why that is the case? Because if you kind of just put a Utility multiple on it it's quite a bit of value 10 to 15x the value in the stock.
And then I have a follow-up.
Okay Andy this is Drew.
I think the way we're thinking about it is '15 is sort of a foundation year for the growth opportunity that we have over the next couple of years.
And as we look at it we were really focused on making sure that we put the building blocks in place for making that 2017 aspiration.
Taxes are a big piece of what we do every day.
And we manage them as well as we can like every other line item on the income statement.
And like I said earlier it's not out of line with where we have been in terms of an effective tax rate over the last 5 years.
So we think this is part of our normal operating procedure.
And this year it's -- there's a couple of lumpy items in there that are helping us get there.
But this is part of our expectation and what we expect to do every day when we come to work.
I understand that.
But again I'm not going to debate with you but if you go back to your Regulation G disclosures your statutory tax rate's 36%.
So I'm just trying to look at the true earnings power longer-term of the company.
The follow-up I have this is on Pilgrim.
I guess since big snowstorm the plant's been out.
If you can kind of give us an update there? And if I'm not mistaken you were supposed to have an outage in 2015 on Pilgrim? And so whether this unforced outage will help on the scheduled outage that you had or is it just an unfortunate outage? And then in the spring you'll go into your regular outage? And also the cost of having the plant down during this time of the year? Yes Andy this is Bill.
So to answer question regarding Pilgrim the plant shutdown due to a Storm Juno it shut down orderly safely without incident on the 27th.
We did lose off-site power to the facility.
However all safety systems and backup power systems worked as planned.
So we've been working through that dealing with a number of issues.
We expect that plant to start up in the near-term and in the next couple of days and be back to full load probably sometime this weekend.
As it relates to the planned outage we do have a refueling outage that's scheduled in the spring.
That remains unchanged.
So we still need to refuel the facility and perform normal maintenance on that facility as we originally planned.
So nothing really changes there.
And I have one really very quick question.
On just EWC I didn't see any CapEx numbers for '15.
Is that something that you guys disclose or you don't give? No.
It should be in there Andy.
It's on table -- it's in Appendix B.
Okay.
And how much is that for '15? $425 million.
$425 million.
Okay.
And so your operating cash flow at EWC is how much? I don't think we disclosed that specifically.
I will now like to turn the conference call back over to Paula Waters for closing remarks.

Thank you Paula and good morning everyone.
2015 is an important year for Entergy because it would be one in which we continue to execute the strategy that we’ve been pursuing for some time.
As we report results for the first quarter I’d like to start by putting the progress we’ve made in some perspective.
Two years ago we laid out an ambitious agenda for the future we wanted to create one in which Entergy was growing because our communities and customers were prospering.
One goal in that agenda was to deliver stability and efficiency by maintaining solid financial putting and by making Entergy a more nimble organization one more aligned with the changing energy landscape.
To that end we joined MISO and also began the process transform the way we work by removing cost from our business and aligning talent and resources with strategic company imperatives.
Another goal was to provide clarity a well defined path forward identifying what business initiatives the company would focus and the timeline for execution.
We accomplished this by first articulating our vision and mission for the future simply but precisely.
We filed and concluded several major regulatory proceedings including four rate cases representing 80% of utility retail sales which provide clarity on future earnings opportunities.
We also ended our efforts to spinoff and merge our transmission assets by ITC.
Finally we said that our well defined path would focus on seven major strategic imperatives which will refine down to growing the utility business managing risk and preserving optionality at Entergy wholesale commodities.
As many of you may recall from our Analyst Day presentation last June we outlined our plans to achieve these imperative.
Over the past year we have continued to provide greater detail as to how we intend to capture the opportunities available to us and today the picture is much more complete.
We have filled in details of what we aim to achieve how we will achieve it and a timeline for execution.
In terms of performance results and growth we continue to be in line with our expectation.
In the near term financial results for the first quarter of 2015 include operational earnings of $1.68 per share.
That’s a strong start to the year and while it’s still early it is clearly in line with our expectations for full year results.
Andrew will elaborate on this in a few minutes.
On our strategic efforts a brief look at that confirms the soundness of a number of the business decisions we made over the past two years many in partnership with our regulators.
For example joining MISO has proved enormously beneficial to our customers.
In the first year alone customers across the utility realized nearly $240 million in energy related saving exceeding expectation.
Consistent with our expectations the utility also realized substantial capacity related savings due to the lower reserve margin required within MISO’s larger footprint.
With an industrial renaissance underway in the Gulf South region fueled by low natural gas and electricity prices it became clear that Entergy’s utility business was well positioned to capture an enormous growth opportunity.
In order to meet this opportunity we expanded the number of people dedicated to growing our industrial customer base.
This team laid out a detailed map of where the opportunities would likely materialize to develop the customized strategies to serve these new and existing customers.
With an effective partnership with state and local officials we have worked tirelessly to help to track industrial customers to the legion and as of March 2015 the Entergy utility business has experienced seven straight quarters of industrial sales growth.
As we said we would we are leveraging this opportunity this industrial renaissance provides keep our customer rates low while modernizing our operations strengthening reliability and growing rate base.
Some important examples of this include our announcement last year to purchase the Union Power facility in Arkansas the completed construction of Ninemile 6 ahead of schedule and under budget and planned transmission builds in Louisiana Texas and Arkansas.
Importantly we are also taking deliberate steps to create the financial flexibility we will need to drive even more growth.
Our current effort to combine Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is one good example.
Obtaining authorization for a purchase capacity either in Texas in addition to the existing transmission and distribution providers is another.
Focusing specifically on 2015 as you can see on Slide 2 it promises to be another busy year.
We have set our sights on accomplishing a number of important tasks this year and we are on track.
For example Ninemile 6 began commercial operation in late December and we were pleased to welcome the Louisiana State officials and members of the LPSV to its official grand opening in January and out of the construction of a new high voltage transmission project necessary to maintain reliability in the Lake Charles area load centre among the largest in Entergy’s history.
MISO Board approved the project last week and we will be filing for LPSC certification very soon.
In Arkansas Governor Hutchinson signed legislation that establishes a formula rate plan for the forward test year and also addresses evidentiary considerations in setting return on equity and the proper method to determine the AFUDC rate.
Because it eliminates the need for a major base rate case every two years to three years this law will allow Entergy Arkansas to align rates with investments in a timely manner to focus time and resources on activities that create sustainable value for the state including job growth.
In Mississippi within the recently approved rate case and a new law passed this quarter we now have a well-defined rate structure including forward looking feature available credit faster recovery that will allow us to attract new customers and businesses for the state.
We’re also making progress on task that we have targeted for the second quarter.
For example last Friday Entergy Arkansas filed its base rate case requesting to recover cost that result in $167 million increase including a 10.2% ROE a formula rate plan with a future test year.
The latter would be further recently approved legislation We expect new rates to go into effect in early 2016.
New rates associated with the formula rate plan to go into effect in early 2017.
It is worth noting that after this case is resolved we expect to have two utilities operating under rate plan plans with forward looking feature.
In fact nearly 85% of expected rate base in 2017 will be under FRPs or other formulae rate making mechanisms.
Over the next few years at the utility our priority is to continue to implement our resource plan which we are calling power to grow and which is designed to allow us to support the economic growth in our service territory and maintain reliable service to existing customers all while keeping rates low.
And by 2020 you see a need to construct approximately $3.7 billion and new generation resources consisting of six new power plants.
We also expect 635 miles of new and upgraded transmission to come online by 2022.
First most of these projects were subject to approval by our regulators we will be making the necessary filings seeking those approvals.
Let me give you a bit more detail about both the generation and transmission needs that comprise in the utilities power to grow.
On the generation front utility supply plans include for example three new build VCDT.
More specifically we are planning for whether through self-build or other agreements one 800 megawatt plant in the mid-south region pending the results of the RFP that is underway to solicit proposals for new generation in this region of our system.
The other plan would be in Wotab specifically within the Lake Charles area which is experiencing rapid industrial expansion.
Completion of this facility is targeted for 2021.
Third would be in Texas specifically the Western region also by 2021.
The generation resources are in addition to the planned acquisition of the Union Power facility as well as the construction of Ninemile 6.
It is important to know that as with the 2020 Amite South facility to help build projects with the other new plants I mentioned would be marked tested via RFP or other mechanism as directed by our regulators.
But the need to modernize as well as to meet growing demand is clear.
In addition to support near-term needs we anticipate adding one CT plant in the Lake Charles Louisiana area by the end of 2020 as well as CT in New Orleans in New Orleans in 2019.
Both of these plants will further diversify our generation portfolio by providing quick start peaking capability serve growth and meet occasional reliability need.
On the transmission front our resource plant includes significant investments in transmission to the new and evolving NERC requirements as well as facilitate committed and expected growth and attract future growth.
Major projects include the $62 million project we announced this month in Arkansas build 24 miles of line in part to attract new industrial customers.
In Texas over the next two years we have approval to build three 230 KV transmission projects filling more than 65 miles of line and more than $150 million in investment.
In Louisiana we plan to make significant investment about $56 million in new high capacity transmission facilities in mid-south which will make economic energy available to our customers and ensure reliable service in the heart of this industrial load pocket.
In addition we intend to build an approximately $187 million project including contingency in the Lake Charles area and action recently approved by the MISO board.
I'll make a note here that everything I've just listed has been part of our capital plan for some time.
We began by identifying the context in need moved to the level of investment we thought it would take and have now named specific projects which merely provide detail and clarity.
As I have noted the power to grow projects will bring significant economic and reliability benefits to the customers and communities we serve and if our plants are approved we'll translate to $8 billion of capital expenditures over the next three years resulting in $3billion to $4 billion in incremental rate based growth.
$1.05 billion to $1.1 billion in utility net income and utility parent and midpoint earnings per share are between $4.50 - $4.90 by 2017.
In addition to this activity we are in the early stages of reviewing new investments and they could provide significant value to our customer.
As we have before we are identifying need in context and as these specifics begin to emerge we will provide more.
For example in Louisiana the staff of the public service commission issued a composed order establishing a pilot program that would deploy instruments to stabilize natural gas cost including acquisition of supply to a direct interest or joint venture.
Recent Mississippi legislation also supports such investment by providing for rate recovery and capital investment in natural gas reserves in order to foster long-term stability in the cost of fuel.
We will also continue to evaluate opportunities for operational reliability and customer service improvements as the industry continues to evolve and these could involve investments in the grid.
We will work again in partnership with regulators and policy makers to achieve legislative and regulatory frameworks that support constructive outcome both for our business those it serve.
This is a long list but we know that everything on it is important.
If we continue to make progress on this list as we expect to do we continue to deliver good customer service with a more modern and reliable system that can accretive return levels and if we do it all while maintaining our rate advantage we will have creative value for all of our stake holders.
The stability and financial flexibility created by these actions will help to put us into positions as discussed a dividend increase with our board of directors.
A discussion that could come as early as this fall.
Turning to EWC here to over the past two years we've made progress on resolving numerous uncertainties and improving productivity.
Most importantly our EWC plant have operated safely and reliably.
The nuclear fleet's average capacity factor over the past five years has exceeded 90%.
We also made it a priority to better align our commercial and operational teams.
If this alignment would be the foundation of everything we sought to achieve the substantial values subsequently created by our risk management in hedging activities particularly during periods of extreme market volatility these evidence are success in this regard.
Our confluence factors resulting in much lower prices and less volatility this past winter in Northeast markets our portfolio remains well positioned to capture upside from volatility as we see reserve margins decline and inadequate fuel supply infrastructure for the foreseeable future.
We also made progress towards resolving some of the uncertainties surrounding the license renewal at Indian Point.
We did this in part by successfully arguing the plant is grandfathered under the New York Coastal Zone Management Program.
All this decision is being appealed by the New York State Department of State we continue to believe that based on the facts we will be successful in extending the license life at Indian Point into the next decade and beyond.
We remain committed to working constructively with the state of New York and regulators in this process.
All the recent shut down of Vermont Yankee as well as the ongoing investment growth at utility has diminished with absolute and relative side EWC remains an important asset in the Entergy portfolio.
As we look to the future we will continue to focus on operational excellence and adapted commercial approaches.
We'll also continue to advocate for changes to price formation and reform of the Northeast market structure.
Continued out of market policies and intervention at state and regional level have made clear the critical need for federal guidance and direction in independent system operator who is been -- is responsible for competitive regional market.
In particular we believe guidance is needed in implementing new policies for both capacity and energy pricing which are market based for more transparency and provides fair value to attribute to provided by each type of generating resource.
Entergy has been an active participant in many proceedings including clear and competitive market.
Also initial signs of problem recognition are emerging.
Generators and restructured markets left the constructive changes implemented in the near future.
Without such change sustainability of otherwise viable existing generating units will continue to be at risk especially given the investments required to properly maintain and reliably operate these facilities.
We remain committed to working constructively with the FERC and the ISOs to achieve fair and balanced competitive markets in North East.
In 2017 based on market crisis at the end of the March we estimate EBITDA of $540 million at the EWC.
Two years ago we redefined our mission be a world class energy company in business to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.
We set plans and strategies to live that aim.
I am pleased to report on our achievements for each stakeholder.
Our owners we set our objective to deliver top quartile returns in 2014 we did so.
All our customers we said we wanted to achieve best in class service.
Most importantly to do this by keeping power flowing when the lights do glow getting them back on as quickly as possible.
This June the Southeastern electric exchange would recognize Entergy with its Chairman's award our transmission team work restoring power quickly and safely after last year's tornadoes.
Also this year perceivable reasons and for the 17th year in a row EEI with its emergency recovery award.
We said we would maintain our rate advantage.
Today our average retail customer rates across all classes are 20% below the national average.
We said we maintain our commitment to support the communities reserve.
Last year alone be contributed more than $16 million in numerous agencies foundations and other organizations all working make our communities better.
The recognition of our performance on this front we are recently named to Corporate Responsibility Officer magazine's ranking of 100 best corporate citizens.
We are proud to be number 36 overall as well as the top ranking utility.
And finally to our employees we said we would cultivate a culture rewards and fosters achievement in doing so we would create a company that everyone is proud to call their own.
This effort will never have an endpoint.
Everything I talked about today is evidence of our success on this front and the credit goes entirely to the 13 000 plus people across Entergy.
So again today it is clear that Entergy is on a path to create sustainable long-term value for its stakeholders.
We believe our track record of achievement over the past two years of service is an evidence of what we can achieve in the years to come.
Again in terms of performance result and growth at Entergy we are where we expect to be.
We are in track to accomplish what we set out to achieve/ And with that I'll turn it over to Drew.
Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
Before I get to the quarter's result I would like to spend a few seconds on our new quarterly earnings package.
The release and appendices focus largely on results on or forward-looking disclosures are primarily in the webcast presentation.
We have also made a few additions and on which I'll point out as I go through the results.
In case you're having trouble finding a particular item we are provided a cross-reference on the page 22 of the release.
Our earnings package is organized a little differently but the disclosures that you depend on are still provided.
Hope you will find the new items all responses to your feedback.
If you find that is not the case report to us now.
Now let's turn to the quarterly results.
Slide three summarizes first quarter consolidated earnings per share.
Operational results exclude special items from the decision to close Vermont Yankee and the HCM implementation in 2015.
Operational earnings per share were 1.6 a $1.68 in the first quarter of 2015 lower than the $2.29 per share earned in 2014.
The quarter-over-quarter decline was largely attributable to lower wholesale energy prices at EWC.
Slide four summarizes first quarter EPS with the utility and parent and other.
Combined operationally EPS was $0.97 per share in the current period compared to $0.90 in the first quarter in 2014.
Utility net revenue was the base driver and billed retail sales increased 1.5% on a weather adjusted basis.
Once again the strongest growth was in the industrial class.
Quarter-over-quarter nonfuel O&amp;M increase mostly in line with our expectations.
In the near term expenses were higher by $0.07 due primarily of planned maintenance outages.
Nuclear spending increased $0.04 due largely to higher regulatory compliance expenses.
Other expenses increased to $0.10 of the quarterly variance most of which have direct cost recovery in net revenue including energy efficiency cost and MISO administrative fees.
Utility first quarter 2015 results included an income tax benefit as well.
You probably noticed that we added a new adjusted earnings view that endeavors highlight the underlying performance of the utility business with parent and other which combined on the basis of our dividend policy.
Turning back industrial sales for a moment on slide 5 they came in at 2.9% higher than last year.
The growth was again across almost all customer segments.
Chemical saw the highest increase primarily due to core alkali and petrochemical customers.
Transportation segment was also strong.
Other industrial sales increased -- although industrial sales increased they were lower than we expected due to customer outages and some delays with new customers and expansion projects.
Moving to EWC slide 6 shows both EBITDA and EPS for the quarter.
EWC operational adjusted EBITDA was $254 million in the current quarter about $200 million in the last year.
Closer of Vermont Yankee and is mostly un-hedged position last year down than more than half of the quarter quarter-over-quarter decrease.
Closer of VY also affects every line item and that makes the understanding detail drivers difficult.
There for in spite 27 and 28 in the appendix provide additional information to help you navigate.
Excluding VY net revenue will still remain driver for the EBITDA decline as wholesale energy prices in the first quarter of last year was significantly higher.
Now in VY nuclear generation increased on fuel refueling outage.
On an EPS basis EWC’s operational earnings were $0.71 per share lower than the $1.39 a year ago.
In addition to the drivers already noted EWC had a higher effective tax rate and higher realized earnings on decommissioning trust about half of which was for VY.
Briefly moving to slide 7 OCF was $611 million in the current quarter about a $150 million lower in 2014.
The most significant driver was lower net revenue from lower wholesale energy prices with EWC partially offset by higher net revenue at utility.
Now let’s turn to forward looking information.
Slide 8 summarizes our 2015 operational earnings guidance which we affirm today with the midpoint of $5.50 on a range of plus or minus $0.40.
We are ahead of expectations through the first quarter as it still in the year and our expectations for the full year remain on track with our original guidance.
As we look at the longer term expectation slide 9 summarizes our EWC EBITDA outlook based on market prices as of quarter end.
You will note that they have not changed much till end of the year despite the volatility between then and now.
We are still bullish on power and natural gas versus the current market but not as bullish as we were and that means that we now expect EWC’s EBITDA will be below our previous point of view expectation.
That said we received consistent feedback that the [POV] based EBITDA has been a source of confusion since we introduced it last summer.
Markets have been within our point of view range and below our point of view and multiple times over the last year and again that EWC markets and by extension earnings a volatile.
To simplify we are returning to our previous practices of externally communicating only the market based EBITDA expectation and to this gladded in the related of today.
We will continue to provide our point of view on the market but not those specific point of view EBITDA estimate.
While on EWC continue to receive questions regarding impairment.
As in the current quarter we’ve not incurred an impairment law but we continue to monitor this issue which includes consideration of the expectation of future economic conditions particularly price levels is also stat of operations in the caring value of the asset.
Keep in mind impairments would not affect our decisions with respect to continued operations of the plan.
Slide 10 reflects our 2017 outlook for utility and Parent and Other.
The utility outlook remains on track for 2017 operational earnings of 1.05 billion to 1.1 billion.
As we have said before this includes our statutory tax rate and pension discount rate of 5%.
Foundation for utilities growth outlook is it capital investment plan continue to expect 5% to 7% [indiscernible] through 2017.
Nearly $1 billion union acquisition and other potential generation refresh our aging fleet as well as to meet new customer loaded clients.
And by transmission investments to meet noted requirements and customer reliability needs industrial expansion.
In addition of the capital investment plan we will need to execute on rate cases in our Arkansas Texas this year to achieve our objective.
Few final comments on financing activity before I conclude into deep corporation have $550 million five years notes which will come due in September this year.
And with finance those notes and advance from maturity date possibly as early as this quarter.
We are also amending Entergy Corps $3.5 billion credit facility along with $650 million of companion operating company line of credit to extend for one year and to account for the ELL EGSL business combination.
Lastly on March 31st S&amp;P revised its rating outlook for Entergy Corp and its subsidiaries to positive from stable.
S&amp;P specifically noted increased focus on our regulated businesses the expectation for above average utility sales growth and recently passed Arkansas legislation and other factors that are expected to continue to strengthen our business risk profile overtime.
As we’ve said we’ve made a lot of progress in the last couple of years and we remain on track to achieve our objectives over the next few years and create real and sustainable value for our key stakeholders our owners our customers our employees and our communities.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
Thank you.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin of Smith of UBS.
Your line is now open.
Now could we address first off the sales growth? You addressed it at length in the commentary but perhaps can you jive the first-quarter 1.5% relative to the full-year target? And also in contrast I see that -- I suppose in your guidance you talk about utility revenue up $0.55 for the year.
And I think you hit it net about $0.25 though a constructive commentary there where do you stand viz-a-viz the EPS as well? So the percent change in the EPS on the utility if you can? Theo why don’t you start and then if you could.
So Julien I’ll maybe address your first question in terms of the growth.
As Drew said the 1.5% was primarily impacted by what we saw in the industrial sector in terms of where it came in at 2.9%; most of that that was driven primarily in two areas.
The timing of new and the expansion project that we expected in the first quarter as well as the one time unexpected issues with just some of our existing customers.
And those two issues roughly represented about 50% of the difference in terms of what we expected versus where we ended up.
So clearly that seems we’ve had some softening in the first quarter.
Clearly some of that we will see pick up as we go out into the year in 2016 and 2017.
So it doesn’t change our overall expectation as it relates to 2017 at this point in time.
What I’ll also say though even with the 1.5% growth as you mentioned our revenues were still strong and revenues got fairly much close to our expectations.
And so it’s still early and we’re still assessing what we believe will be as we go through the year but I mean the first quarter delays clearly could dampen our 2015 results but again as Drew mentioned early we still see ourselves in our earnings guidance for 2015.
Yes this is Drew and I’ll just add that in addition to what Theo said we do have some cost in that top line which are offset in O&amp;M so I think in my comments talking about around $0.10 is other stuff for some things like MISO cost and energy efficiency cost that – we’re a little ahead of where we expected them to be and they’re offset in that net revenue line so that’s that part of why the net revenue line is higher than maybe what you’re anticipating as well.
Got it.
But just to be clear on the sales growth its fundamental delays is not necessarily a shift in the fundamental outlook for a decline in the commodities et cetera? Yes I mean what we thought primarily was just our shifts and timing.
As we’ve said from an oil price perspective we still don’t see any significant impact.
I mean we fundamentally believe a large majority of our industrial growth through ’17 is coming from projects that are already in advanced stages of development and first quarter didn’t change that.
This is Leo Jul I’d just add.
We’ve mentioned this before but I guess just it garnered some reinforcement.
Lot of these expansions into our new customers they’re big projects.
And they target a date that it’s not uncommon for capital projects in the 100s of millions of dollars or in some cases the multi-billion dollar range a month or two here and there.
So that may or may not occur in line with what we would have expected from time-to-time also.
And then secondly if you don't mind a kind of bigger picture question on dividend you alluded to it earlier.
What's your targeted payout ratio? Or how do you think about the dividend in the context of the EWC business and the utilities at this point or prospectively? Well from EWC business you don’t think about it at all.
The dividend is purely from utility Parent &amp; Other and we had outlined at the Analyst Day our expectations that 65% to 75% payout ratio of utility Parent &amp; Other Earnings was our target.
Got it.
So perhaps in looking at that initially here remaining towards the top end of that range would that be a fair statement as you think about growing that in the 2016 timeframe? Well when we look at it just to put some context about it.
Our objective being to return capital to shareholders and to do it on an attractive sustained basis we’re looking to create an era of sustain dividend growth.
So as we look at their growth in that segment of the business we’re going to chase the payout ratio and have the dividend jumping around a lot.
We’re going to look for sustained growth in the business and we’ll make recommendations in the board put together a path with the dividend that achieves that consistent with what those long-term earnings growth power would be.
So we’re going to review that as we always do every year.
But when we get into this fall it's going to be reviewed in the context of the growth that we continue to believe.
This is going to occur within that segment as well as other factors that the board will consider like reinvestment dollars that we have to put into the dividend et cetera or into the utility business but that’s primarily the way we’re thinking about it.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.
Your line is now open.
I was looking -- I was a little bit confused by the decommissioning benefit that you guys have in the release.
As I recall you guys were expecting the decommissioning expenses to increase.
So I was wondering is that decommissioning -- how should we think of that decommissioning and guidance? The decommissioning trust fund and what have you and the benefit that you saw in the quarter versus the rest of the year? It’s a good question Paul.
So when we were in EEI we talked about $20 million to $25 million of net income drag from -- and ’15 in ’16 and then it kind of trailed about 10 after that.
So we do expect that the comedown as critical aspect of the decommissioning process lined up lined off I should say.
But since the EEI as we go closure to the actual shutdown date and we started to need to make decisions around how we’re going to manage that decommissioning trust.
And it become clear that we needed to be de-risking that trust as we moved to the first phase of decommissioning which cause have to turn over a portfolio a little bit more than we had previously anticipated.
And so we’re trying to do that at a nice ratable basis as we go through the year starting a little bit last year and it will probably continue on into a little bit into the first quarter maybe even next year.
But it should be about $0.04 or so each quarter is kind of what our expectation is.
And that over the course for the year is going to take up a lot of the offset drag that we were anticipating for ’15.
So -- overall for the year would be anticipated now to be about flat or maybe even slightly positive or I would say about flat is the expectation.
For the full year? Full year.
Okay.
So there's going to be -- okay.
And then in terms of the zone changes in New England I was wondering if there was any impact on you guys -- and this is in terms of the point of view change -- well not the point of view change but has there been any quantitative change in the point of view? I know you -- directionally you guys are bullish but has there been any -- anything in terms of your outlook for the markets that has changed quantifiably? Yes Paul.
We have in fact lower point of view from our natural gas perspective obviously that close through power prices.
However we still do remain bullish compared to the market overall.
As it relates to the zone in the New England; it’s really a tough call in terms of where those markets end up.
We’re still working through that but really there is a wide range of outcomes depending on supply demand balance.
And so right now I don’t have anything to share specifically as it relates to a price range.
We’re trying to get more information from the ISO and further evaluate that.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.
Your line is now open.
Can you talk about the -- what your earned return on equity has been in Arkansas? And given the recent changes in the regulatory structure there and your intent on filing under the new structure whether you think you'll see -- over what trajectory you think you'll see improvement in that return? Excuse me yes sure Greg this is Bill.
I believe if you look at the pocket -- webcast pocket it was slight -- a normalized it was about 5.9% for the last 12 months ending March 31 of this year.
And clearly what the perform and what the rate case filing we expect that you think about the impact and rate case filing and the revenue impact as well as net income impact we see Arkansas as we go forward ’16 and beyond with the formal rate plans forward test here making significant movement to earning there a lot of return.
Okay.
So you think the balance -- that you'll be litigating that case for the balance of 2015.
And to the extent there is a change and we'll see that show up in 2016? Yes.
I mean hopefully an effect there is a large statutory period in Arkansas and while we don’t have a procedural schedule set just yet we would expect to see the case playing out through the remainder of 2015 and we would see the latest rate impact in March from the filing date which was last Friday.
And our next question comes from Daniel Eggers of Credit Suisse.
Your line is now open.
Just going back to the point of view comment or kind of the change there I think previously it looked like you had about $100 million or $150 million of POV uplift for 2017.
How much has that point of view changed? And does that have any bearing on kind of the 2% to 4% EPS growth target you guys provided starting back at your Analyst Day? This is Drew.
I’ll take first crack and then I will let anybody else to jump in.
But as it relates to the EBITDA uplift that we’re talking about before I think it was 650 million to 700 million.
And as we kind of gone along and prices has stayed along and gotten closer and closer to those periods it's less than less likely that we would make it into the range.
And so our point of view as that slipped in the timeframe that we’ve talked about below that 650 fresh oil I think.
Last quarter we are right about the edge and now we’re a little bit below.
So that’s what’s happening within.
As we look out we still have a bullish point of view that’s start to ride as we get beyond the period that we’re talking about but it’s been pushed further out as we've gone along.
As it relates to the 2% to 4% I think the primary driver at the utility continues to be right on track.
The utility and the Parent &amp; Other combined entity in fact we've given those ranges for 16 and 17.
Those are still very much intact.
In fact we’re looking for additional opportunities maybe even in the ’17 timeframe.
But as EWC is the part of that earnings mix it doesn’t look like at this point that EWC would allow us to make it back into that particular range.
However you never know stranger things happen in 2017 and particularly still pretty far away.
So we wouldn’t say we can’t make it but right now as we look at our view we’re probably just below that level.
Got it.
Thank you.
And I guess just on the gas reserves and rate base conversation can you maybe just share a little more detail on how those two processes are going to work? And what you guys have from an overall annual natural gas burn rate? In terms of Dan it's Theo -- in terms of how those process works we have the pilot program Leo mentioned in Louisiana and we'll be filing comments relative to that this month and that will progress based on the commission's directives in terms of how they moves along.
At this point we are just -- we're exploring options.
And the timing of that is going to depend on the form of the investment and again how that plays through the regulatory process.
In terms of gas burn today I'm not certain I can't tell you exactly how much it is.
We would probably just have a follow-up and give you that information.
I would just say Dan I mean obviously given the nature of our fleet or gas burn is pretty significant.
I don't have it at the top of my head have the -- how many it is a day -- we are talking about that -- I'd say it's true -- I said it's going to be a small amount of our overall gas burn to begin with.
We are not going to be able to jump in and hedge our entire supply.
As Leo said I mean it's very large and we're spending in the neighborhood of $3 billion a year on gas supply maybe a little lower because prices are lower today.
But it's a significant amount and so we would be trying to carve out at least initially small layer that would allow us to kind of get our feet under it and we really appreciate how this is going to work through all the barriers operational processes as well as regulatory process.
And I don't want to ask a detailed question but I'm not going to anyway.
The EWC guidance for this year at $0.70 versus the $0.71 you did in the first quarter I know you don't want to update guidance too early but is there a plausible case where you guys would not make money at EWC for the rest of the year? Well if prices went lower yes.
But I don't think that's our expectation.
I think we are a little ahead of schedule through the first quarter and we expect to do to earn a little bit more but as we are going along the nature of the EWC business in particular has gotten highly seasonal and anchored towards really the winter timeframe.
And so we do expect to make a little bit more money at EWC during the course of the year.
The bulk of the earning at this point are completed through the first quarter.
Our next question comes from the Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research; your line is now opened.
Just a little more flavor this morning on the natural gas pilot.
And I guess you mentioned both Louisiana and Mississippi.
Could you maybe give us a sense of just rather than an amount of gas just potential investment size? Is this tens of millions hundreds of millions billions -- just some rough idea of potential scale of these investments? This is Drew.
It's certainly not in the billion at this point and tens of millions is probably too small.
So it's going to be of in the neighborhood of 200 million to 300 million maybe initially in that range.
It could be a little higher or lower but something like that if we decide to move forward.
Is that just Louisiana or is that both states? That would probably be both states.
I mean Louisiana would be the bulk of it.
Born is considerably smaller in Louisiana.
Okay.
And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have no impairments on EWC as of the current quarter.
Why did you even mention that? Is there something that you are particularly focused on there to bring that up? It's something that we get questions on from time to time and because of that we think that it's something that's been on investors mind.
So we wanted to just make sure we where forthright with a discussion about it and make sure that everybody knew that it is on our radar screen it's something that we are paying close attention to.
That was the primary reason for it.
Okay.
And just lastly in the kind of overall utility outlook that you provided through 2017 would you say the kind of improved Arkansas environment was kind of assumed in there? Or would you say it’s a potential kind of upside to the utility point.
Hi Steve this is Leo.
I mean clearly as we lay out our plan we are in expectation about improving our results in Arkansas.
So I would say if you look at the growth that we see there are primarily three main elements especially when you move from 2015 to 2016 utility but the sales growth its regulatory improvement in Arkansas and clearly it’s the union investment.
So we did have an expectation around that.
In terms of whether there is upside or not it would be worth to find as we go forward and we move through the process of the case itself; that means the early case.
But we had expectation -- to provide improved results in Arkansas as we laid our plans for 2016 and 2017.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Your line is now open.
Hey guys two questions.
One any plans regarding both near-term and long-term regarding the holding company level debt? Meaning is your anticipation to leave that debt there? Is your anticipation to make sure all of it is financed long-term and there's no short-term? You've done a good chunk of that already.
Is the goal to kind of pay that down so whenever EWC has cash flow you can kind of get back to the mode like you used to do a number of years ago of being able to use EWC's free cash to buy back stock? Like how are you thinking about short-term one or two years? And then a three to five year cycle about what to do with the parent debt? I’m not sure where to start on that one Michael.
But there is a lot going on in that question.
In terms of the capital structure I talked a little bit in my prepared remarks about the parent financing that we have coming up.
I think we’re going to do fixed rate notes we’re going to refinance those this fall or maybe even much earlier than that.
We have a lot of financing activity going on the second half of the year with the Parent note coming due the anticipation of the union acquisition and all of the -- and the financings that we’ll have to go on with that at utility level.
And then because of them ELL-EGSL combination we have to redo revolvers for those businesses.
And while we are at it we’re going to go ahead and redo the entire thing.
So we’re going to probably do that a little earlier in anticipation of the ability to close that combination.
So those are the main activity things and in terms of going forward we are continuing to anticipate that we’re going to carry that short term debt for a while and it’s going to continue to float.
The short term rates haven’t moved too much and certainly we have lot of exposure to interest rate on the pension side of our book.
So any movement on that side is balanced pretty well on the interest rate side for the roughly $1.5 billion of short term debt that we have.
So we would anticipate that we would change that anytime soon.
And as we think about the overall Parent debt capital structure including both the short-term variable and the fixed rate these we’re still targeting at 18% to 20% Parent debt to total debt ratio.
So we could probably be a little bit above that this year as we close through the union deal.
We’ll probably draw a little bit more on that but over the next few years we do see it trending down and provided we don’t come up with a whole bunch more investment opportunity.
So those are the kind of the main thing we’re going to continue to kind of maintain our capital structure at the parent level for the time being as it is today.
But obviously we’ll be looking for other ideas and opportunities as we go along.
And I think that answers everything that you had in your question Michael.
Yes that's perfect.
An unrelated question.
A while ago a year or a year and a half ago there was a lot of discussion about Palisades in terms of operating performance -- NRC oversight a handful of other things.
Can you just kind of touch base on that a little bit? It's been a while since I think you've talked about it so I just want a sanity check what's out there.
Sure.
Michael its bill.
Palisades has been running extremely well above a 90% capacity factor.
The one issue we have out there is the embrittlement issue which is still under review by the NRC.
We expect clarity on that by this summer.
And again I think based on our own analysis we really do not believe there is any issues that I hope that we could verified in July.
But now Palisades is back on track and operating very-very well.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Your line is now opened.
Just a quick one back on sales growth I'm afraid.
I was just curious on slide 5 where you talk about existing large customers down largely on outages.
But it would have been up absent outages.
Can you -- how significant was the outage piece? And can you just size that relative to the delays you saw on the new customer stuff? Yes.
Jonathan this is Bill.
I think I mentioned as part of the first question.
Roughly when we in terms of where we landed versus our expectation it was approximately half and half.
About half it was really due to timing of new and expansion projects and half was really due to only one-time unexpected issues or outages with some of our existing customers.
Thank you.
And then an interest of time our next question will come from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar.
Your line is now open.
My Arkansas question got answered so let me move to Mississippi with just one question.
Is the new law I mean pre- the new law you can make an investment in infrastructure; let's say the development didn't happen and the Commission could come back with a used-and-useful argument and disallow that investment.
Is that what this eliminates? Charles when you speak to the new laws and we’re talking about what was passed recently as it relates to the ability to make investment in anticipation of economic growth.
Yes.
The thing you refer to on the first page you release.
Yes I think it's really more than anything again clarity as it relates to how you can make that investment in anticipation of that growth.
But I think it really goes to what’s happening in Mississippi in terms of improving relationships and their recognition of the importance of economic development and growth economic growth in the state again the clarity I think was more around you can make that investments and there was an expectation.
We should have an expectation that that investment would be viewed as necessary and from as rate recovery perspective market it less controversial.
Okay.
That was it.
Thank you.
Yes Charles I’ll just add.
What we’ve been doing over the last couple of years is working really in partnership with all of our stakeholders in each jurisdiction.
And that partnership is around but it is it that we're all jointly trying to accomplish we're all jointly trying to accomplish economic prosperity in the communities that we serve and that they regulate or that they have administrative controller over through the governor what have you.
So we spend a lot of time on that overall objective.
And that objective being to promote economic development and prosperity in those economy.
That has resulted in a better understanding between us all about what our objectives.
We share and what processes that we can utilize that we can agree on.
So at the end of the day legislation and laws and alternative show-up the way we would design it and then we’re going to come up the way that jointly between us governors legislative bodies economic development agencies and regulators that we’ve been in the best interest of those of their jurisdictions and our customers.
And so what I think you’ve seen in Arkansas where you’ve seen in Mississippi what we’ve seen with the proceedings around capacity transmission distribution writers in Texas what we hope to see as we continue to go forward and Louisiana is things that work and more job creation and economic prosperity and better communities where we serve.
That’s really all we've done.
But it should turn out well for us if it turns out well for the communities.
And I think that's what you're seeing in those types of legislative efforts in the regulatory outcomes that we've seen over the last couple of years.
Okay.
Thanks Leo.
But it certainly gives you more confidence in your 2017 outlook for the utilities in what's happened in Arkansas and Mississippi recently? It absolutely does and the reason that confidence is important is if you think about what's happening in all of these jurisdictions.
In Arkansas we have major customer coming online with a steel mill.
And we provide a lot of electricity too in Louisiana.
We've got significant growth along the Gulf Coast as it relates to the petrochemical business.
And in Texas we see not only the industrial expansion but in Texas we see significant commercial and residential load growth as well and we have to be ready willing and able to serve that load and do that while we continue with the process we started around 10 years ago refreshing the generating portfolio and continuing to meet an evolving set of reliability requirements as it relates to transmission and so.
The confidence is good because it gives us the ability to deploy that capital more quickly and in ways that better meet those customers' needs.
So it's a win-win for everybody.
And I would like to turn the call back over to Ms.
Paulo Waters for any closing remarks.
Thanks and thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release in Web site for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statement.

Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We will begin today with comments from Entergy’s Chairman and CEO Leo Denault and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
In an effort to accommodate everyone with questions this morning we request that each person ask no more than two questions.
In today’s call management will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties is included in the company’s SEC filings.
Now I will turn the call over to Leo.
Thank you Paula and good morning everyone.
Consistent with the first quarter Entergy’s second quarter performance was in line with our expectations.
Operational earnings per share were $0.83 about where we planned it to be and we are on track to meet our full year guidance.
Given market conditions and recent business developments current indications point to utility parent and other earnings near the lower end of the 2016 range that we outlined on Analyst Day still meaningful year-over-year growth in the base utility business.
We remain on track to achieve our financial outlook for 2017.
To achieve the expected growth we made notable progress on our 2015 to-do list as shown on Slide 2.
These important tasks are key steps in moving forward with our near and longer term strategies for the utility as well as Entergy wholesale commodities.
At the utility the strategy we are implementing is centered on our opportunity as well as our obligation to invest capital in order to replace aging infrastructure strength and reliability meet economic development and other growth needs and ensure that the environmental profile of our generation fleet is in line with the evolving regulatory framework.
We are also taking steps to facilitate this investment by combining the Louisiana utilities.
In July Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a unanimous settlement to combine the two companies.
Pending action from the Louisiana Public Service Commission later this month closing is on track for the fourth quarter.
In May New Orleans City Council approved several significant matters paving the way for more economic and efficient service for the city’s residents.
First the transfer of the Algiers assets in New Orleans to Entergy New Orleans which ships approximately 22 000 customers to the utility and second the $99 million securitization financing which includes three components: the recovery of Hurricane Isaac storm costs $75 million in cash storm reserves for electric restorations and nearly $6 million for restorations for the gas system.
This financing completed in July gives Entergy New Orleans a fully funded storm reserve.
We have come a long way since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina 10 years ago.
The New Orleans City Council recognizes that our city is stronger when its power infrastructure is stronger more efficient and more reliable.
Taken together these actions will benefit Entergy New Orleans and its customers in several ways.
Stakeholders will benefit from a more streamlined and efficient regulatory process.
The utility will be better able to attract capital at reasonable rates because it will have an expanded balance sheet.
It will also have stronger liquidity which will make us stable and it will secure lower cost efficient generation needed to more reliably serve its customers.
We are also pleased that representatives of the New Orleans City Council expressed interest in exploring Entergy New Orleans purchase of one of the units of the Union Power Station.
We will be filing an application later this month seeking City Council approval for this transaction.
The purchase of the union unit will take the place of the power purchase agreement that had been previously approved by the City Council.
We believe the purchase of the union unit is an ideal way to meet New Orleans generation needs at approximately half the cost of building a comparable new unit.
We made other notable progress on the generation investment front.
In May we announced the results of the request for proposal for long-term capacity in the south region of Louisiana which generally covers the southeastern part of the state.
Consistent with the views of an independent monitor the Entergy Operating Committee elected to proceed with the self-build options.
Next summer subject to regulatory approval we will begin construction of the St.
Charles Power Station a natural gas-fired combined cycle generating plant located in Southeast Louisiana along the Mississippi River industrial corridor.
Entergy Louisiana plans to file for regulatory approval with the OPSC in the third quarter of 2015.
We anticipate that the plant will begin commercial operations in the MISO market by summer of 2019 one year ahead of the schedule we presented last November at EEI.
In June Entergy Texas distributed the final documents for its 2015 RFP which seeks both limited and long-term resources.
In the long-term portion of the RFP Entergy Texas is seeking up to 1 000 megawatts of CCGT capacity and energy located in the western planning region of the state beginning in the summer of 2021.
Entergy Texas intends to offer a self-build option into the 2015 RFP that can provide its customers long-term capacity energy and in-region reliability benefits.
Entergy recently provided notice that it plans to issue another RFP for new CCGT capacity beginning in the summer of 2020.
Again this is one year earlier than we have previously indicated.
This RFP will seek long-term capacity and energy in the West of the Atchafalaya Basin planning region or WOTAB and will include a self-build alternative.
Capacity is needed in this region of Southwest Louisiana to mitigate supply constraints as well as to modernize aging infrastructure.
Selections for both RFPs in Texas and Louisiana are targeted for early to mid-2016.
Regarding the 4-unit Union Power Station transaction I mentioned earlier we continue to anticipate a closing by the end of 2015.
Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana are on track to purchase their respective units.
In addition as I stated Entergy New Orleans is now positioned to seek regulatory approval to purchase one of the facility’s 495-megawatt trains in place of Entergy Texas.
We heard the positions of the commission staff and other parties in Texas and do not see a viable path forward.
We have concluded that the parties in Texas prefer a long-term market tested capacity solution located in the State of Texas.
Our RFP is seeking exactly that.
Our objective is to obtain the support of the staff and customer groups for our approach to meeting generation resource needs in Texas.
We look forward to continuing to work with the Public Utility Commission of Texas and other stakeholders to develop strategies to meet the states’ future generation resource needs.
We also continue to make productive investments in transmission.
In April we announced that in the fourth quarter of 2015 Entergy Arkansas will begin construction – constructing a new approximately $62 million transmission line from Monticello to Reed crossing parts of Drew and Desha counties.
The project will include expanded electrical facilities including a new substation in Reed to move power more reliably and efficiently into the region.
Also in April Entergy Louisiana filed for certification of an approximately $57 million transmission line in Southeast Louisiana with an in-service date of December 2018.
This project is expected to lead to $515 million in savings to Louisiana customers over its first 20 years which will be realized through a lower fuel adjustment cost.
We are taking advantage of MISO market opportunities to meet the needs of the changing generation landscape.
In May we announced the significant $30 million transmission investment to upgrade the connection of the New Orleans metro area to Ninemile 6.
At Michoud generating facility which currently supplies the area was placed in service in the 1960s and will soon be deactivated.
The upgrades we are making now are required by MISO prior to deactivation.
In June Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed for certification of an up to $187 million transmission project with an in-service date of June 2018.
This project will expand capacity in the WOTAB region in order to strengthen reliability there.
It will also facilitate industrial growth.
Improvements to ETI’s transmission system are progressing including upgrading of existing transmission lines and the construction of three new transmission lines we see the new PUCT approval in 2014 and 2015.
The new transmission line projects totaling about $165 million will add approximately 64 miles of 230 KV transmission lines along with other transmission facilities.
These projects are expected to be in service by the summer of 2016.
Entergy Mississippi has four transmission projects in various stages of development.
These projects represent more than $280 million of investments in Mississippi to support the economic growth and provide additional reliability.
And the service dates are scheduled in 2018.
As we have said many times before one of Entergy’s priorities is to invest in infrastructure to better serve our customers while maintaining reasonable rates.
Our rates across all classes are approximately 20% below the national average.
Industrial rates in Louisiana and Texas are 15% to 20% below the national average.
In addition there is every indication that natural gas prices in the United States will retain their competitive advantage for some time in relation to the rest of the world.
We believe that these low energy costs combined with our competitive power rates and other regional advantages will continue to attract jobs and businesses to the communities we serve.
The resulting increase in the industrial and other sales can and will facilitate our investment opportunity.
It is important to remember however that there are significant drivers of the need for that investment in addition to sales.
On that note I know many of you have questions as to why industrial sales were lower this quarter following seven straight quarters of robust growth.
Macroeconomic factors as well as outages by some of our large customers mass expansions by others as well as the fact that other new customers began to come online.
Drew will provide more detail in a minute but the vast majority of the projects in our plan that were in advanced stages of development earlier this year remain on course.
The fundamentals driving industrial renaissance in our region low natural gas prices sophisticated connected infrastructure already talented workforce all remains strong.
We therefore continue to be optimistic about the opportunity for sustained industrial growth in our region.
The significant economic development prospects for Southeast Louisiana in particular have garnered recognition from the federal government.
Last month the U.S.
Department of Commerce named the New Orleans to Lake Charles chemical corridor to a program launched in 2013 designed to accelerate the resurgence of manufacturing in America.
This designation may result in federal incentives and grants for the 12 new regions selected of which ours is one.
Entergy is proud to have worked with local officials and other stakeholders to help this area achieve this distinction.
All of this progress as well as that made in the first quarter of this year is due to the sustained hard work of Entergy employees Entergy’s collective efforts to work more collaboratively with our regulators and other stakeholders and of course our regulators’ commitment to balance the best interest of our customers our communities and this company.
I will say again that we remain on track to execute our investment program that is the backbone of the commitments we have made to our customers and other stakeholders.
We continue to make progress on short-term and mid-term objectives and expect substantial gains to result from that progress.
We are doing what we said we would do and there is every reason to believe that we will achieve the financial performance that we have targeted.
EWC’s strategy revolves around executing well on what we control the operations of the plants and the commercial transactions to hedge the risk.
In the second quarter our plants ran well.
Aside from an Indian Point 3 the EWC nuclear fleet delivered approximately 92% capacity factor which includes a 34-day outage to refuel program.
As many of you know the transformer outage at Indian Point resulted in a 16-day shutdown of Unit 3.
You have heard me say before that EWC is a volatile business.
We felt the negative impact of that volatility this quarter much as we felt the positive impact in past quarters.
Average Northeast power prices for the second quarter were more than 40% below last year’s levels.
Moreover forward power prices continue their decline following an average of more than 6% for our plants in the Northeast since the end of March this year.
These low prices are coupled with the market structure that does not reflect the value of nuclear power.
Congress continues to indicate its concern about the specific market structure challenges.
On July 8 the Chairs of the Senate and House committees and subcommittees responsible for energy and power Senator Murkowski and congressmen Upton and Whitefield communicated this concern in a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Norman Bay.
In the letter the committee chairs raised concerns about organized wholesale electricity markets including the impacts certain market rules were having on reliable base load plants including nuclear plants and ultimately on consumers.
Entergy shares these concerns and we are encouraged by FERC’s willingness to consider these issues.
We are also hopeful that FERC will take subsequent action as soon as it can.
Our mission at EWC is today what it has always been to optimize asset value and minimize risk.
We continue to pursue this mission through effective commercial operations and by vigorously pursuing clear regulatory processes and frameworks.
The latter would include an improvement in the design of the Northeastern power markets as well as constructive outcomes on Indian Point.
On that note over the years many different studies have provided clear evidence of Indian Point’s importance to the region.
We saw the release of another last month by the Nuclear Energy Institute.
This study founded Indian Point contributes an estimated $1.6 billion to the economy of the New York State annually and $2.5 billion to the nation as a whole all life while contributing to New York State and national clean air goals.
Quantification of these important benefits reaffirms the value of this facility and provides yet another reason why we believe Indian Point must and will operate into the next decade at the least.
That said based on 2015 guidance EWC is currently less than 15% of Entergy’s earnings.
Our robust utility growth grounded in $8 billion of investment and $3 billion to $4 billion in rate base growth both through 2017 will continue to reduce this percentage.
Also as most of you know the U.S.
EPA issued a final version of its clean power plan yesterday.
The rule is complex and would take time for us to conduct a full analysis.
While we continue to be concerned about the legality of EPA’s approach that analysis will focus on five key issues: One the compliance timing.
Two the requirements the rule will impose on each state.
Three a state’s ability to elect a mass-based approach and establish a training ready plan.
Four the impact on the nation’s existing nuclear fleet which in 2014 comprised nearly 63% of the U.S.’s emissions-free generation.
And five the overall impact that we could have on our customers.
You should expect to hear more from us on the months to come.
In conclusion I would note that as we have said in the past our business is a long-term play.
Short-term and even mid-term volatility is embedded in it but is that does not detract from this company’s strong fundamentals.
We are confident that the growth opportunity in our utility service area is intact and we have a solid strategy to realize that opportunity.
And we remain focused on managing risk and preserving optionality of EWC and that we will vigorously pursue our business plans and continue to make productive investments to help achieve long-term growth.
As a result Entergy’s performance for the quarter as well as the year is in line with our expectations.
Earnings expectations for 2016 remain insight and we are on track with our 2017 outlook.
As we noted last quarter we expect that the stability and financial flexibility created by our actions this quarter this year and indeed over the last several years will put us in a position to begin to act on one of our major objectives of sustained dividend growth starting with a discussion with our Board as early as this fall.
With that let me turn the call over to Drew.
Thank you Leo.
I will start by covering our second quarter results and then I will turn to our longer term financial targets.
Slide 3 summarizes consolidated earnings per share.
In the second quarter of 2015 Entergy earned $0.83 per share in line with our expectations.
Additional details on the results are provided in the press release and slides published this morning.
I will cover some highlights on results starting on Slide 4 where utility parent and other had combined earnings per share of $0.87 on an adjusted basis.
This compares to $0.98 per share last year.
Details of quarter-over-quarter variances can be found in Appendix B1 of the release and here are some of the key points.
Despite a 1.5% decline in sales volume quarter-over-quarter on a weather-adjusted basis our overall net revenue variance was positive.
This was partly driven by capital investments that benefit customers such as the new Ninemile 6 plan.
Residential sales growth also contributed as well as new industrial customers and expansion projects.
The increase in net revenue was offset by a corresponding rise in related depreciation operations and maintenance expenses and other items.
O&amp;M increases not offset in that revenue included increased nuclear-related expenses of about $0.09.
Over half was from increased nuclear regulatory commission oversight of the Arkansas nuclear 1 plant.
Earlier this year ANO was placed in column 4 of the NRC’s reactor oversight process.
The increased levels of cost for ANO were expected to continue into 2016.
I will take a moment now to talk a little more about industrial sales volume this quarter on Slide 5.
In total the segment was down 1.5% driven by our existing customers.
Refineries were down the most quarter-over-quarter due to their turnaround season.
We anticipated a more significant turnaround season than last year however was a bit more expensive than we expected due to macroeconomic factors such as high product inventories and a strong dollar.
Core alkali was also down quarter-over-quarter and more so versus our expectations.
Utilization from this sector was lower than anticipated due to unplanned outages compounded by margin pressure from lower demand and the market’s recently added supply including our customers.
The decline in our existing large industrial group’s mass growth from expansions and four new customers who began to ramp up this quarter.
Continuing the trend from last quarter these new customers and customer expansions are coming online and ramping up more slowly than expected.
I will talk more about that later as part of our forward-looking view.
Switching over for a minute to EWC Slide 6 indicates operational earnings per share this quarter were about breakeven as expected.
You may recall that we said on the first quarter earnings call that the bulk of 2015 earnings were completed at that time.
The quarter-to-quarter decline was driven by a $5 per megawatt hour decrease in revenue on the operating nuclear plants and lower volume from the 34-day refueling outage of Pilgrim compared to none last year.
This decline in EWC nuclear revenue was the primary factor in the operating cash flow change as shown on Slide 7.
Also reflected was improved net revenue with the utility largely triggered by productive investments put in service to benefit customers.
For the full year view on Slide 8 today we affirmed our 2015 earnings per share guidance with the midpoint of $5.50 and a range of plus or minus $0.40.
Recognizing we still have the summer to go we remain on track at each of our segments to meet full year expectations.
You may recall that we expect some tax items to come into play this year but we currently do not expect any tax items in the third quarter.
Slide 9 recaps the 2015 guidance midpoint for utility parent and other adjusted for weather tax and special items in 2016 and 2017 midpoint outlooks.
These outlooks are consistent with our previous disclosures last year at Analyst Day and at EEI.
The slide also provides 2013 and 2014 results on a comparable basis.
This presentation illustrates how the base business has grown with the expectations for continuing growth through 2017.
The two main drivers for this growth are making productive investments in improving our utility return on equity as shown on Slide 10.
Importantly our plans for capital investment to modernize our infrastructure maintain and enhance reliability and meet new compliance standards have not changed.
Our 2016 rate base growth includes the Union Power plant acquisition which approved by the required regulators.
We contribute roughly $0.02 per share per month in 2016.
While we have made some adjustments to the structure our regulatory procedural schedules in required jurisdictions still allow for us to close by the end of the year.
In addition we have moved up the projected in-service date of the St.
Charles power station project.
Assuming LPSC approval next summer the new construction drawdown schedule will accelerate about $0.03 per share of AFUDC into 2016 and $0.08 per share into 2017.
Approximately 90% of our $8 billion of planned investment from 2015 through 2017 will fall under a formula rate plan rider or other constructive regulatory mechanism.
This percentage includes the forward test year FRP proposed in the Entergy Arkansas rate case.
New rates will be effective by early 2016 for the rate case.
And in early 2017 the changes are warranted in the first FRP review.
Regarding sales growth for the balance of the year we are already seeing evidence that the refining sector is once again performing as expected.
However with the core alkali markets challenged the balance recently added supply.
Overall uses from these customers for the remainder of the year may not reach the levels we had anticipated.
Still new customers and expansions are coming online.
Previously we had indicated that the vast majority of our large industrial customers were already under construction or had reached their final investment decisions.
This is still the case.
However we have seen them trail their own expectation for the last couple quarters.
Of 17 large industrial projects expected during the year 14 are complete or under construction.
Of the 14 most have experienced delays getting online and a few have lower ramp rates than expected or lower peak usage than expected.
Of the three that are not under construction they currently are delayed and represent only about 0.1% of our expected industrial sales next year.
O&amp;M expenses and other elements of managing our return on equity you are anticipating some benefit over time from the roll off of temporary nuclear compliance cost and an estimate – an approximate 50 to 75 basis point increase in discount pension rate to 4.75% in 2016 and 5% in 2017.
Looking further ahead we expect our capital investments and plant infrastructure transmission and other distribution system improvements will ultimately lower O&amp;M costs for our customers while enhancing reliability in our service territory.
We will persist in looking for every opportunity to control O&amp;M costs as part of this.
Given current considerations such as capital investment rate actions cost changes and interest rates assumptions our financial outlook continues to support our previously stated expectations for utility parent and other earnings per share.
As illustrated on the slide for 2016 we are currently near the lower end of the range.
For EWC EBITDA projections have declined as shown on Slide 11.
Our expected energy and capacity prices have dropped by $1 to $2 per megawatt hour since March 31.
As you know wholesale prices are volatile.
We continue to follow our hedging philosophy that allows us to benefit from upward price movements while protecting against the operational and credit risks.
All-in-all our actions this quarter and plans for the future represent sizable utility parent and other earnings growth potential in the coming years.
The fundamentals of the utility business to achieve this growth are in place including our solid credit profile reflected on Slide 12.
Backed by these credentials we are maintaining a sound financial foundation to make investments and better serve our customers.
We will continue to execute on the plan we have laid out for you.
Every plan faces challenges we are confident in our ability to meet them and succeed.
Our mission as a company is to create sustainable value for our four stakeholders.
Our owners our customers our employees and the communities we operate in.
That mission is foremost than what we do everyday.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
Thank you.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore.
Your line is now open.
Thanks.
I have two questions.
At what point – and when we are looking at 2017 midpoint outlook do you reassess the ramp rate on the industrial projects that are already up and running and the excess expected in-service those that are still in queue and give us a full update it would seem that you really wouldn’t have the visibility for – with any degree of certainty until some point in early to mid-16 is that fair? Theo? Greg this is Theo Bunting.
As part of our planning process we would try to as get much information around as we possibly can.
And I think in terms of when we would – you would expect us to see some updates relative to that we would probably be pointing toward EEI in that timeframe.
And as you said and as drew has mentioned in his opening comments that information does change from time to time.
And our expectation is we will try to stay abreast of that as best we can and continue to update it as new information becomes available so that we can roll that into our overall expectations.
Great.
Greg this is Leo.
I will just add while and we have said this since the beginning as it relates to the addition of these customers that there are big projects billion-dollar investments in some cases $10 billion investments.
Schedule is always an issue in that kind of thing.
Our sector has the same issue when we build big projects that are first of the kind or unique or whatever.
The issue here is while its common and some may come early some may come late they may ramp differently the investment profile that we have got between now and then is remains intact.
And as you recall the way the business model works the rate base growth is kind of what we are targeting here.
And so if you look out there whether they come in a little bit late a little bit early it doesn’t really change when these power plants come.
The only changes we have made I think Drew outlined and a little more details would lie in the script is a couple of the capital projects that we had are actually coming up earlier than we had originally planned just given the timing and the need and it’s a combination of this growth from this sector but also the need to replace the aging infrastructure that we have and the opportunity to get these things done and constructed.
So it’s not just the sales piece of it that we need to look at it from a timing standpoint.
It’s coming – some of it’s coming later because of the size of the projects and other factors but the investment profile that we have got over the next several years through the first part of decade is pretty much on track.
Okay understood.
So to get to your guidance aspiration for ‘17 and it reflects expectations for top line revenues from industrial you would have to either readdress your expectations for revenue requirement from other customer classes reflects your costs then? Yes.
I think that’s true and on a short-term basis if we have said these productive investments we would expect to ultimately get into rates.
And if the sales aren’t where we have expected them to be in any given period you are right and you would have to adjust in another area.
Okay.
Second question is on EWC obviously the power curves come off quite a bit in New York and New England can we attribute that to winter premiums coming off or is it summer discounts getting steeper some combination of both and do you think there was any market activity that you can see in the foreseeable future that might reverse that trend? Greg this is Bill.
A couple of things I mean obviously we have seen gas prices come off tremendously at $1 since last summer.
We have also seen some folks take some steps to try to mitigate the gas supplies issues that type of thing in terms of using LNG facilities for base loading of plants that type of thing.
So I think there is a number of issues in the market that have driven those prices down.
As we look forward we are – we are slightly bullish gas prices as we look into ‘16 that increases a little bit over time but we are seeing some movement in New England in terms of some market structure improvements that would come on in the ‘17 ‘18 timeframe on some energy price formation issues that could be constructive.
I don’t anticipate at this point seeing the numbers we saw in 2014.
I mean that was largely driven by the polar vortex and kind of the after math of that but we do see some constructive positive steps from an energy price perspective.
The reason I asked is because you moved your hedging the construct of your hedges around a bit for next year and hedged up just a fair amount more but you – there were no demonstrable changes in your hedge profile beyond ’16 is that a fact – is that a function of your point of view? Yes that is a function of our point of view.
And to be frank what we are seeing out in the market as well there is a little bit less liquidity out in the market.
And obviously we are not – we don’t want to ourselves in a situation where we are locking in at these low prices at this point in time.
So we are evaluating that as we go and we think there is some upside.
Thank you.
Thanks Greg.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.
Your line is now open.
Good morning.
Good morning Paul.
Just I guess I wanted to sort of follow-up on that letter that you mentioned from Murkowski and some other Republican leaders regarding market reforms.
And I noticed this as well and I guess what I am wondering is I mean how quickly do you think anything from that will actually come about and I mean I don’t know I mean they also sort of threaten legislation that they are going to get it done I don’t know I mean I just wanted you just elaborate a little bit more what you think the practical benefit of that would actually maybe be? Sure.
As it relates to that letter I think it’s on track with our general thoughts in terms of what needs to happen in the market.
We have had similar discussions with the ISOs and a number of other stakeholders.
We think that in general depending on what gets implemented there is upside potential of say $3 to $6 a megawatt hour as a result of these changes to energy price formation.
Now the question on timing this will come probably in increments.
And as you look at the timing of being implemented you are probably looking at the timeframe of ‘17 ‘18 before they could actually make those changes to their systems and get those in place where we would see that uplift.
Now the exception there is what we have got going in ISO New England as it relates to the winter reliability program.
That’s currently being reviewed by FERC as we speak.
We could see some uplift there in the upcoming winter if we get a decision in our favor as it relates to that.
So it will kind of evolve over time but we see that happening across the next 5 years or so 3 years to 5 years.
And it will be a series of debt is what we are talking about I guess as opposed to one sort...
That’s what I would think Paul is it’s I think just having discussions with the ISO there are some practical issues you have to deal with in terms of how you can change the systems associated with that and so they are more than likely would be steps taken along the way as opposed to one just big massive change.
Okay great.
And then just on the – on Friday there was an order out of FERC that denied the authorization that some of subsidiaries were seeking for – to issue and sell securities and what have you.
And I can’t recall seeing that before with FERC think it was kind of run of the mill maybe I am wrong so I was a little surprised to see that they rejected it I know that you guys can put pressures you can re-file I was just wondering is there any significance to this or is this just sort of a hiccup that happened because of the format which they seem to be unhappy with or how you guys report it could you just elaborate a little more on that? I think you hit on most of it in terms of the format.
They have a way of using backward-looking results to assess what the coverage ratio ought to be.
And we had suggested some changes to that and they didn’t want to put them in.
So I think it is a bit of a technical challenge but we should be able to put the new filing in and get that complete fairly quickly.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Thanks Paul.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from UBS.
Your line is now open.
Hi good morning.
It’s Julien.
Good morning Julien.
So perhaps first question just as it relates to Texas and East Station and the decision to pull that out.
Just to be curious could you jive that with the RFP and what the ultimate thought process is around pursuing self-build options or acquisitions under rate base? I suppose what drove the decision to provide a little context and ultimately next steps? Theo? Hey Julien this is Theo.
As Leo indicated I mean really in Texas it came down to – it was clear that a clear path in Texas that the parties really preferred a long-term capacity solution located in the State of Texas.
And as he said earlier our Western RFP is seeking just that.
Our objective in Texas is to obtain support of the staff and the customer groups or approaches that meet the generation’s resource needs in Texas.
And I mean clearly as the record indicated as it relates to Union transaction that was not the case.
And as Leo mentioned in the script also in the opening comments there has been interest expressed in New Orleans and we are pursuing regulatory approvals.
We will pursue regulatory approvals in New Orleans with the City Council relative to that.
The second part of your question I am not sure I understood when you said kind of what’s next.
Right.
I suppose fundamentally there is not necessarily any opposition to doing rate-based or cell phone options per se right? This was more about a locational angle on the plant rather than your ownership of the unit per se correct? We don’t believe there is any opposition to self build.
Matter of fact if you look – if you go explore the record I will mention by the other parties around another option being a self-build option in Texas.
So we don’t clearly believe there is any opposition to it.
It was just a preference in Texas the interveners and other parties in Texas.
And clearly I think their views and comments relative to other options made it clear that was self-build.
It is something that could be pursued in the future.
Got it.
And then separately on transmission I know you have provided some background here but I would be curious I suppose MISO did an out-of-cycle study on MISO’s doubt during the quarter could you elaborate on that as it relates to the studies that you discussed yourself at the various capabilities? And ultimately how that jives with your capital budgeting process and if that’s already reflected in your CapEx expectation? Sure.
I am not – when you talk about I mean we had one out-of-cycle project I believe which was the Lake Charles project.
But in terms of just transmission and MISO in general I mean as you know we have a fairly robust transmission investment in ‘15 through ‘15 – ‘15 through ‘17 I am sorry capital cycle.
We nearly doubled in ‘15 versus ‘14.
And as Leo went through his opening comments he mentioned a number of transmission projects that are currently being approved and the process of being approved and will be underway shortly approximately almost $800 million of transmission projects.
So we feel good about the fact that we have got transmission opportunities.
In terms of the MISO study the VLR study in that MISO accelerated six projects into ‘15.
And largely most of those projects were already in our plan but what we do see potentially is an opportunity for acceleration of some of those projects.
And the fact that MISO is moving forward in that process gives us our confidence as these projects will be approved by MISO.
And perhaps just to clarify is that already reflected in your CapEx outlook as it stands today? For the most part yes.
Alright great.
Thank you.
Thank you Julien.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse.
Your line is now open.
Hey good afternoon guys.
Leo just on the industrial outlook and kind of maybe the longer term prospects can you share a little bit about how much time you are spending on economic development and kind of your quoting industrial customers and you were pretty busy last year.
How is that changing if at all right now? I will let Theo jump in but we continue to work that process across all of our jurisdictions.
You have seen a lot of success obviously with things that are under construction in the near-term in the Louisiana Texas Arkansas and others but we have – as we mentioned earlier as we went through our reorganization last year one of the things that we had done was beef up the business and economic development functions and we continue to have those folks out working the process things like the region designation here in Louisiana and other things we are working to make sure that we help continue to promote the region.
So I guess how much time we spend in quite a bit some people – we have a department that’s their full-time job working with the states.
And obviously the states are backing off this either as all of them are working working very diligently to try and help bring economic development.
So that includes we continue to utilize our site selection database.
We continue to try and pre-certify sites.
We continue to build transmission into areas that could house more manufacturing before the fact that they are not necessarily ready yet.
So all of those things both in our activities from an economic development operationally and also from the regulatory process we are continuing to pursue forward on all of them.
Theo I don’t know if you want to add anything.
I guess Dan one thing I will add in addition is we continue to work very closely with states in which we serve.
And as Leo mentioned we – in the regulatory environment itself I mean if you look at some of the transmission projects he mentioned that we have done some of those transmission projects or specific around working to foster economic development in the regions.
So we have a lot of people dedicated full-time to helping the regions that we serve growth.
That’s part of our growth story.
Okay.
So I guess if I think about the economic growth from here maybe I will say it differently.
If you look at industrial demand industrial recruitment today are the whiteboards more full or less full than they were 6 or 9 months ago? I mean is the population of opportunity changing as you talk to customers? I would say we are continuing to pursue more opportunities and tried to keep that pipeline growing.
I mean that’s our objective quite frankly is to do as much as we can to continue to see a growth in the pipeline.
In terms of kind of where we are now versus 6 months ago I would have to go back and look at the data specifically but it is something we focus on.
And we understand that having a strong pipeline is really a key to having success in the economic development area.
And I will just add the investments that we are making in the system again make the area more conducive.
So we are modernizing the generation fleet.
We are improving the fuel cost because of that.
We are improving reliability because we are building things like the Lake Charles Transmission Project that’s going to not only help serve the customers that are under construction down there but it’s going to beef up the system down there to be able to handle more.
So we are – we kind of get out.
While we are placing the aging infrastructure beefing up the reliability to meet new requirements and to meet existing construction of those facilities it puts us in a better position to bring those in.
So the investment profile helps fulfill not only what we are doing right now but bring other stuff in as well.
And I guess just separate from market reforms when you guys think about your more than and your point of view do you see gaps against the fours where you think New England New York prices should be today and maybe help quantify what you think the delta is with the sell off in power prices? Yes I don’t.
I think what we are seeing obviously from a supply perspective is continued growth in the supply in Marcellus.
Obviously that is creating a discount to Henry Hub.
And as we look forward in terms of our pricing we don’t see those numbers going above 4% anytime in the near future.
I mean we see that staying fairly consistent with now but again I said we are bullish.
So we see it rising but not getting above that level.
So that’s kind of where we sit.
And obviously the power prices are commensurate with that.
I mean as you look at that from an energy price perspective.
And that’s true.
I will just add that once you get out little further on the curve and don’t mention this earlier there is a bit of liquidity discount that’s out there.
And we have seen this in the past as you roll the props some of that comes out of the market and improves things a little bit but some of that had gone away last year but it seems to have reasserted itself again.
So I guess but for some backwardation because of liquidity you think the curves are pretty realistic to where the fundamental value is? No I have said we are still slightly bullish.
For ‘16 we are a little bullish and that kind of increases as we got – go out over time but it’s relative to where we were a year ago.
It's obviously a lower price level.
Okay got it.
Thank you guys.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Your line is now open.
Well good morning.
Good morning Jonathan.
Leo could you just help us kind of parse your statement about the dividend still being potentially up for discussion in the fall when we would look at your utility Parent &amp; Other the low end of guidance for 2016 would put the pay out ratio above 65% to 75% target a little bit.
So you are going to be thinking about other things beyond payout? What we are looking at is a long-term perspective Jonathan in the growth and the business.
So I think the way I have characterized it in the past is that we are looking out several years.
We are looking at sustained dividend path.
We are not going to jump around with it to follow when earnings go up a bunch in 1 year raise it a lot.
When they don’t go up raise it a little we are trying to get ourselves more of a glide path view about the long-term prospects of the company.
And as we have said we look at the investment profile that we have for the aging infrastructure for the reliability requirements for environmental needs as well as the growth we are seeing in the business and that helps facilitate all of that.
And we see an upward sloping long-term trajectory that would indicate to us that the time is right to look at when to start to follow that earnings path and that could be as early at this fall.
Okay thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies.
Your line is now open.
Good morning.
Just two quick questions I wanted to follow-up on Dan’s question your view on gas I mean is it closer to the $3 number or the $4 number.
And second in your comment Leo you had stressed or stated that EWC makes up roughly 15% of the consolidated company’s earnings where is the sweet spot there with EWC? You want to talk about gas? Yes.
I think on the gas price I mean you guys know where it is right now we are closer to the $3 level and the $4 level at the front end of the curve.
As far as the sweet spot I mean I wouldn’t say there is a sweet spot or not it’s just the fact of the matter is right now the investment profile that we have and the utility is very very robust.
The opportunity for returns are very good there.
The need for the investment because of as we have mentioned before 75% of our non-nuclear facilities in the utility are over 30 years old I mentioned the Michoud plant for example in my prepared remarks.
That’s a plant that’s been online since 1960s and there are more efficient ways currently if we – once we beef up the transmission system and meet the MISO requirements to be able to serve that load and deactivate that unit we deactivated 25 units since 2010 and we continue to go on the path to have more and bigger units in that realm as we add to the system.
The risk reward trade off is just better at the utility than it is at EWC for our deployment of capital.
So it’s less than 15% and I am being generous with that because I take out the tax benefits that we are showing up in the 2015 numbers before you get close to 15% in 2015.
And if you just protect out forward what’s happening with the utility business and the growth profile we have there 15% becomes smaller.
The 15% become smaller and smaller as we go through time given that trade off.
So there is no sweet spot it’s just a fact.
And as it relates to the business itself it’s a different business.
It should have a different investor mix.
It should have a different dividend profile.
It should have a different commercial reality.
And so our objectives right now are to grow the utility business and we – we have no plans to grow the EWC business to merchant business given that risk-reward trade-off and the different investor base.
But the fact is over time between now and 2020 in particular we are going to become more and more and more a utility.
That’s just the fact.
Great.
Thanks for taking my question.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Your line is open.
Hi guys.
Just I wanted to make sure I understood something on the utility capital spending levels and the utility demand trends it strikes to me that your tone today was that the demand trends a little bit softer or maybe a little bit more delayed than expected.
But then when you talked about the capital spending trends and the generation it seems as if several new projects have moved forward a year or so I am just curious it seems like if demand more pushed out a little bit maybe projects would get pushed out not accelerated but can you just kind of walk me through the difference there? Well I will start and let others jump in Michael.
But the – remember for almost a decade we have had I think we called it the portfolio transformation strategy where we have been working to replace the generation fleet over the course of the last several years maybe not quite a decade but maybe close.
We have seen an ever-changing landscape of the reliability requirements out of the NERC and certainly the continuation of environmental policies etcetera whether it’s MATS or now CPP or what have you.
All of those things have created a real need for us to continue to modernize our generation fleet to add new transmission facilities and to make investments in environmental compliance and we are going to continue to do that.
We are at a point now where we – as we change out that generation fleet it’s turning more and more absent the union projects turning more and more to construction to replace that aging fleet.
So that part of the process is reasonably agnostic to what the demand growth is.
You are changing out the megawatt for megawatt because you get the more efficient new power plant in place versus one that with the O&amp;Ms creeping up etcetera because of its age that just happens over time.
So that’s really not changed one way or the other.
The growth whether it’s a little bit delayed or not is still pretty crisp.
And we are making plans to build generation and replace the aging infrastructure as well as meet that new demand.
If a plant slips a year that doesn’t really change the capital program.
And in fact even as long ago as Analyst Day when we were asked so what could be your capital program we said well not very much because it’s a long – you got to plan this stuff in advance.
So even back then we had mentioned that the capital program around the edges wouldn’t change a lot as long as the demand growth stayed in a reasonably close proximity to what we are seeing.
And so delays one way or the other where – what we mentioned back then might have some impact that projects might move around but that they were still going to show up.
So all it is is sharpening the pencil on the need for the facilities and when we can get it done based on the age of the fleet interaction with the transmission system and when this stuff is showing up.
And right now there hasn’t been big enough shifts in anything to change the construction program versus where we were.
We have a couple of projects.
We are going to market test for an earlier project.
We are bringing the new generation here at St.
Charles project online a little earlier.
We brought Ninemile 6 online early.
And I think we have learned from that in terms of the timing it takes.
So we were embedding in some of these projects how long it would take to go from planning to development to construction and we have proven we can do it faster and at a lower cost and that’s what happened in Ninemile and that’s what we had anticipated what happened at St.
Charles project and likely happens on some of the other stuff as well.
So we are – the construction program meets many needs sales growth is one of them and an important one we have to be ready willing and able to serve these customers when they show up.
And if they show up six months later than they had planned we still want to be there with a reliable system when they show up and that's really all we are doing.
Got it.
And then one question on EWC what do you see is the impact and do you think it’s already embedded in market expectations for some of the new pipeline projects maybe constitution which is coming online in New York there is also some smaller pipelines that actually came on in New York pretty recently as well as some of the more longer dated projects the Eversource and Spectra projects or the Kinder Morgan 1 to get you new gas up into New England? I think the Eversource-Spectra project is one that is kind of included in the current market expectations.
Obviously in New York I think those are progressing well and are also kind of already included in the market.
I think the issue is going to be how do some of those get paid for specifically in New England and how – what is the cost recovery mechanism going to be and how is that going to work is it going to go through the legislative process.
And then – but I think a lot of that is built into expectations kind of going forward.
Got it.
Thank you guys.
Much appreciate it.
Thanks Michael.
Thank you.
And our final question will come from David Paz from Wolfe Research.
Your line is now open.
Hi good morning.
Good morning David.
I believe your 2017 utility outlook expected 3.25% or 3.75% retail sales growth on average just want to make sure is that still – does your outlook still expect to reflect that figure? Well I mean we have continued to look at that and as Theo mentioned we will have a fuller update later this fall probably the EEI but our expectations given the number of changing variables are that we are still in the middle of that range.
Great.
And do you just have – I don’t know if you have given this before but have you – what would every 100 basis point change in that figure do to your 2017 target all else equal? I don’t know that we have published a rule of thumb on the growth rate of industrial change.
Certainly 1% change in our existing base is about $0.11...
Total… Yes.
So it’s like $0.02 for industrial $0.04 for commercial $0.05 or so $0.06 for the residential piece.
So I think – and that's a 1% change across all segments so on the existing piece.
But I don’t know that we have published a rule of thumb around sensitivities for the industrial change in the growth piece 1%.
It would be a little different than the existing piece because the existing piece has the demand charges built into it already and so you would only be seeing the variability around the energy piece that we actually sell to customers.
So – and that’s about 50% of the margin for the industrial piece.
So I don’t know it seems like there might be about $0.04 but I don’t have those numbers in front of me.
Okay that’s helpful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I would now like to turn the call over to Paula Waters for any closing remarks.
Thank you and thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release in website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statement.

This concludes our call.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference.
This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.
Everyone have a wonderful day.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Release and Teleconference.
At this time all participants on the phone lines have been placed on mode.
Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.
[Operator Instructions] Do note today’s program is being recorded.
I would like to now introduce our host for today’s program Mr.
Paula Waters Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please begin.
Good morning.
Thank you for joining us.
We will begin today with comments from Entergy’s Chairman and CEO Leo Denault and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
In an effort to accommodate everyone who has questions we request that each person ask no more than two questions.
In today’s call management will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties is included in the company’s SEC filings.
Now I will turn the call over to Leo.
Thanks Paula and good morning everyone.
Before we get started there have been some questions about the forward-looking numbers we plan to disclose for utility parent and other earnings at the upcoming Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference.
Just to give you a quick preview they will be in line with our previous disclosures.
Regarding third-quarter results with the exception of impairments at EWC results were largely in line with our expectations.
However some of the drivers turned out differently than we originally anticipated including stronger than normal weather that boosted earnings by $0.16 per share which was offset by lower weather adjusted residential sales and regulatory compliance costs at the Arkansas nuclear 1 plant.
As we've noted previously we currently anticipate approximately $85 million of costs at ANO for additional Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspection activities arising out of its placement in Column 4 of the reactor oversight process action metrics.
These costs will impact operational results in both 2015 and 2016.
The Pilgrim nuclear power station will also undergo an additional inspection activities related to its placement in Column 4 by the NRC which will increase its cost in the coming years.
We realize these items while temporary are disappointing we will do our best to mitigate their impact.
However our longer-term objectives remain intact.
Therefore as we work our way through the near-term operational issues at ANO and Pilgrim we maintain our focus on our long-term opportunities.
To that end by most any measure the last few months in October in particular have been very productive.
The actions we've taken demonstrate execution on the strategy we've outlined to you for some time.
For the utility the strategy is to grow the business by investing capital in ways that benefit our customers.
This strategy is centered on our obligation as well as our opportunity to invest capital to replace aging infrastructure strengthen reliability meet economic development and other growth needs and ensure that the environmental profile of our generation fleet is in line with the evolving regulatory framework.
To facilitate execution of this investment opportunity to enhance service to existing customers as well as adding new customers we seek to align our objectives with our regulators’ expectations so that we have the regulatory support and financial flexibility to make those investments.
During the last quarter at the utility we have received approval for the business combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Entergy which was completed on October 1.
Closed on the transfer of the Algiers portion of Entergy Louisiana to Entergy New Orleans received approval of the renewable purchase power agreement in Arkansas which applied provisions for legislation passed earlier this year advanced our generation plan through filing an application for approval to build another new combined cycle gas turbine plant in Louisiana and administering the competitive request for proposal processes for long-term capacity in Louisiana and Texas which include market testing two self-build CCGTs completed nine transmission projects totaling $92 million in investment while being on track to complete the transmission work required to support a major customer in December ahead of that customer’s planned date to begin taking transmission service and received regulatory approvals in Texas Louisiana and from Utility Committee of the City Council of New Orleans for a settlement to end the system agreement next year.
For EWC the strategy rests on safe operations of our nuclear plants and managing risks so we get the most out of that business.
Execution on this strategy requires disciplined and responsible decision-making in a volatile environment.
We have also taken action consistent with our strategy.
We announced the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center CCGT for $490 million.
We announced the decision to close Pilgrim by June 1 2019 and today we're announcing plans to shut down the FitzPatrick nuclear power plant at the end of the current operating cycle in late 2016 or early 2017.
New York State officials worked as hard as we did over the past two months to reach a constructive and mutually beneficial agreement to avoid a shutdown of FitzPatrick but our efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
From a corporate level we've added another new board member one of three this year with expertise that helps position us for the future and importantly raised the dividend for the first time since 2010.
While dividend decisions will be made annually it is our intention to provide steady and consistent growth in our dividend in the coming years.
Continuing to deliver on our strategy will be the key to meeting this objective.
Earlier this year we outlined what we needed to do to execute on our strategy.
Our achievements to date are listed on Slide 3.
These significant accomplishments could not have been possible without the dedication and commitment of the entire 13 000 member Entergy team as well as the dedication and commitment of those we partner with to grow the communities we serve.
However focus is squarely on what's next to continue the momentum we've worked so hard to gain.
One such item we're working on at the utility is completing the planned acquisition of the nearly 2000 MW Union Power Station.
Entergy Louisiana successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Entergy Arkansas and Entergy New Orleans have agreed to purchase this modern efficient CCGT at approximately half the cost of building a comparable new plant.
Just last week Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the settlement in support of the transaction.
No parties were opposed.
We also continue to explore settlement options with the advisors in New Orleans and in Arkansas a decision by the Arkansas Public Service Commission is pending which we asked for by December 1.
And industrial group is the only opposing party.
We remain on track to close the transaction by year-end subject to pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
We've also been working with the APSC and other public officials to give Entergy Arkansas the financial flexibility it needs to make investments and help attract new business to the state.
After passage of legislation providing for a platform for progressive rate regulation we're now focused on the pending rate case.
In addition to the Union acquisition a significant component of the rate case is the approximately $800 million of added investments since the last case.
In late September staff [ph] filed testimony recommending a $217.9 million rate increase and 9.65% return on equity an increase over the current 9.5% authorized ROE.
As a reminder Entergy Arkansas is seeking a $268 million base rate increase and a 10.2% ROE factoring in rider offsets and that increase requested is $167 million.
While we continue to work through the process we view the staff’s testimonials constructive and look forward to working with all of our stakeholders toward a result that aligns us all for growing the economy in the state.
The settlement deadline is December 31 of this year.
In September Entergy Texas field with the Public Utility Commission of Texas for rider recovery of nearly $140 million of incremental transmission and distribution rate base since the 2014 rate case.
These rider filings seek nearly $20 million in new revenue requirements.
Decisions are expected by early next year.
Another area where we have worked diligently to align with our regulators is on the subject of the Entergy system agreement.
The system agreement has been a long-standing source of frustration and disagreements among our regulators.
Entergy Arkansas exited in late 2013 and Entergy Mississippi is preparing to exit within a week’s time.
We are now well on our way to ending this arrangement altogether by September 1 of next year.
After gaining approval by the LPSC the PUCT and the Utility Committee of the City Council of New Orleans the settlement is expected to be taken up by the City Council this week leaving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the final outstanding approval.
Ending the system agreement next year is not expected to have a significant financial impact to ongoing consolidated earnings.
The benefits are two-fold: it simplifies our business and allows us to focus on jurisdictional specific matters especially the utility’s role in economic growth in our regions.
And it allows interactions with our regulators in all jurisdictions to be squarely focused on investing to improve operations and grow our business to benefit customers.
At EWC our top priority [indiscernible] is also an important objective for the future.
In October we began the process to obtain the necessary approvals to support a close of the RISEC CCGT sale by year-end.
We've also begun the process toward an orderly shutdown of Pilgrim and will soon begin the process for FitzPatrick.
These decisions are difficult knowing the effect of plants’ closure will have on our employees and the surrounding communities.
We are committed to ensuring we’re fair to all of our employees as they go through this difficult time.
The sale of the RISEC power plant and the closing of Pilgrim and FitzPatrick are the right business decisions.
Each meet our criteria for assessing strategic options around the EWC fleet.
They are positive NPV decisions over the long term and improve cash flow in the near term and help to derisk the company.
That said I can tell you they are some of the most difficult decisions we as a management team as well as our Board of Directors have ever made.
So while the decisions themselves are clearly appropriate we all had hoped there could have been a different outcome.
With the closure of FitzPatrick and Pilgrim we’ll have two remaining nuclear generating facilities in operation within EWC Palisades and Newpoint [ph].
Palisades is a power purchase agreement for virtually all of its output until April 2022.
For Newpoint [ph] we will continue to work through the license renewal process.
We will also continue to advocate for reforms through wholesale market designs.
Wholesale electricity markets are failing to produce accurate price signals to reflect true marginal cost of providing energy and capacity challenging the long-term sustainability of these markets.
The FERC issued an order on energy market price formation in September following a series of technical workshops to discuss issues regarding price formation in energy and ancillary service markets.
FERC indicated this is a first step in the energy price formation initiative.
We will continue to participate actively for fair market designs that compensate all generators for the attributes they provide to the market.
Through this time of opportunity and change we need strong governance by some leadership at the highest levels of the company.
This year we welcomed three new board members: Patrick Condon Karen Puckett and most recently Philip Fredrickson.
Pat Karen and Phil bring valuable experience to our board with expertise in utility regulatory and financial matters commodity markets business strategy and leading businesses undergoing transformational change.
And last week we promoted new members of the executive leadership team Paul Hinnenkamp senior vice president and chief operating officer and Tim Mitchell acting chief nuclear officer.
Paul’s experience in nuclear and fossil generation and most recently leading our capital projects management organization will be instrumental in supporting utility’s growth strategy with safe and reliable operations and disciplined fiscal and project planning for our capital spending plans.
Tim has the deep technical knowledge and strong leadership capabilities to lead the nuclear organization through the challenges in our nuclear fleet and drive towards excellence in operating all of our facilities safely securely and reliably.
At the same time we thank Mark Savoff executive vice president and chief operating officer and Jeff Forbes chief nuclear officer for their leadership and accomplishments.
They both recently announced their upcoming retirements.
We are grateful for their contributions and continued consultation and advice through this transition period.
We are looking forward to seeing you next week at the Annual EEI Financial Conference.
Our accomplishments and the plans for the future are foundational to consistent utility parent and other earnings growth and steady dividend growth.
We’ve started down the path of providing clarity around the future of EWC.
Whether it's day-to-day operations of the business we’re making strategic decisions our sense of purpose and resolve remains on finding solutions that provide long-term benefits for our owners customers employees and the communities we serve.
Now I will turn the call over to Drew Marsh.
Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
I’ll begin my remarks today with a review of our third-quarter results which are summarized on Slide 4 of the presentation.
Our operational results of $1.90 per share excluding special items related to the impairment of EWC Pilgrim and FitzPatrick nuclear plant and the decision to close Vermont Yankee were up from third quarter of 2014.
As Leo noted this was in line with our original expectations overall but not in line with the expected drivers.
Strong weather made up for ongoing ANO Column 4 expenses and lower-than-expected residential sales growth.
As reported earnings were negative $4.04 for the quarter driven by the impairments of Pilgrim and FitzPatrick.
Details of the impairments and the related accounting were provided in the Form 8-K filed on October 16.
Moving to Slide 5 utility parent and other results were up quarter-over-quarter.
Contributor [ph] to the increase was net revenue which added $0.36 per share a large portion of this was from weather but the remainder from higher industrial usage recovery of the productive investments such as Ninemile 6 and items offset in operations and maintenance categories.
Though net revenue was higher we originally expected an additional $0.05 per share in net revenue from sales growth but missed this target with lower weather adjusted residential sales volume down one-tenth of 1% quarter over quarter.
Also contributing to the favorable variance is an asset write-off of $0.23 per share related to the settlement of the Mississippi rate base that was included in 2014 third quarter results.
The impact of these favorable variances is partly reduced by higher utility non-fuel O&amp;M expenses of $0.16 per share.
Roughly $0.04 of this variance is offset in net revenue.
Of the remaining variance $0.07 was due to NRC inspection cost for ANO and the balance primarily due to higher distribution reliability expenses.
Sales volume from industrial customers increased quarter over quarter by 4% as shown on Slide 6.
Adding nearly 300 gigawatt-hours to our sales this quarter were new and expansion industrial projects mostly from ramp up in the core alkaline and petrochemical sectors.
Volume from our existing customers recovered from the second-quarter decline and came in above third quarter 2014 levels as petroleum refineries ran at high utilization levels.
And for next quarter one of our largest customers is already in an extended outage.
So we currently expect industrial sales to less robust in the fourth quarter.
Recall that lower sale due to short-term outages of existing customers can be less impactful due to demand charges.
EWC third quarter operational results on Slide 7 were $0.18 in 2015 $0.05 lower than in the third quarter of 2014.
Though the closure of the Vermont Yankee added $0.09 to operational result this quarter this was more than offset by a decrease of $5.80 per megawatt hour the average price earned by the nuclear plants still in operation.
Operating cash flow on Slide 8 shows overall lower cash flow this quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2014.
Cash flow at utility was lower primarily due to $300 million of Hurricane Isaac securitization proceeds received last year.
Declines in EWC net revenue also contributed to lower cash flow.
As we move past our third-quarter results we will take one more look at our overall 2015 expectations relative to guidance.
Beginning on the right side of Slide 9 utility parent and other adjusted EPS is expected to be lower than anticipated driven primarily by $0.17 of O&amp;N expenses from ANO Column 4 management $0.06 of incremental reliability spending and $0.07 of lower-than-expected total weather adjusted sales primarily residential.
This brought us below our adjusted EPS expectations which is disappointing.
As on Slide 5 adjusted utility parent and other EPS removes the effects of special items weather and tax items.
However with both favorable weather and income tax variances as well as the operational income effect of impairments for Pilgrim and FitzPatrick.
On the left side of the slide we expect to exceed the original 2015 guidance range and are adjusting the range by $5.50 to $6.10.
Currently we are tracking to around $6.
We mentioned before that we have been working on tax items which could be recognized toward the end of this year.
One of those is connected with the recently completed business combination of ELL and EGSL.
After guaranteed sharing of $107 million with our customers we’ll recognize $1.50 per share in the fourth quarter.
Although there could still be other tax items resolved and recognize in the fourth quarter we expect our 2015 tax position to our REIT to exceed our original guidance expectations.
In other tax matters our third quarter Form 10-Q will discuss the recent settlement with the IRS from the OA09 audit.
The agreement on treatment for our 2009 position regarding nuclear decommissioning liabilities will reduce our federal net operating loss carry forward or NOL from $12.3 billion to approximately 1.9 billion.
Having said that there are a couple points I’d like to make about the settlement.
First the settlement has no material cash consequences or impact on net income due to low utilization of the NOL.
And in second while it reduces our net NOL today we continue to pursue our tax strategies.
We expect our cash tax rate to remain below statutory rates about 10% in the next few years.
Turning now to EWC.
As Leo discussed in his remarks we’ve reached an agreement to sell Rhode Island State Energy Center for $490 million and I expect to close the deal by the end of the year.
We’ve also made the difficult decisions to close Pilgrim and FitzPatrick.
Each of this decision provides greater clarity on the future of EWC.
Rating agencies have reacted positively to the focus in improvements of utility and the difficult decisions we’ve made for EWC.
Following the Rhode Island and Pilgrim announcements S&amp;P noted the reduction of exposure to merchant generation in support of our credit quality.
And Moody’s view the developments along with the utilities support of regulatory environment and improving rate design as credit positive.
A summary of our credit metrics and credit range can be found on Slide 10.
At utility we were pleased with the successful completion of the Louisiana business combination on October 1 and our confidence of the newly combined Entergy Louisiana entity will bring benefits to our stakeholders.
Moody’s assigned the combined ELL a rating of A2 for senior secured first mortgage bonds.
At the same time Moody’s affirmed credit rating for Entergy Corporation and raised the outlook to positive and ratings for Entergy New Orleans were also positive upgraded.
These positive credit rating actions acknowledge the strong financial footing of the company and in doing so help preserve our ability to access the capital needed to finance investment in the business at low-cost for the benefit of our customers.
As noted on Slide 11 we will have more information at the EEI financial conference next week where we will continue the discussion of our business strategy longer-term outlooks and 2016 drivers.
This will include more detailed information for EWC utility sales and the opportunities and risks for our 2016 expectations.
And As Leo said at the outset we still see our utility parent and other EPS for 2016 and 2017 consistent with our previous disclosures.
We will provide detailed guidance for 2016 during our fourth quarter earnings call.
As we continue to lay the groundwork for growth we look forward to moving ahead with our strategies to create value for our customers our owners and our employees and the communities we serve.
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.
So I had a quick question on the cash taxes given the change in the NOL position down to 1.9 billion I know you clarified that you will still have a pretty low cash tax rate.
Could we understand what’s the driver or what helps you get to that low cash tax rate given the NOL position change? Sure Praful this is Drew.
As we talked in the past and we have a portfolio of strategies out there that we are pursuing and those strategies are still intact.
Over time we can see the NOL start to move back up again but we have to go -- right now we just settled so the NOL is back down to where it is at 1.9 billion.
So we just want to make sure that when you saw it come down you’d know what the driver was and what the settlement was.
The important thing is that our tax team is still here they are still working hard on new ideas and new strategies and we expect that those will continue to bear some fruit going forward.
And then in terms of the FitzPatrick retirement from a decommissioning perspective do you expect there will be any impact from a cash flow perspective to Entergy or is the decommissioning fund – fully funded and how do you see that playing out? Well this is Drew again.
So the decommissioning fund meets all the NRC requirements and consistent with how Vermont Yankee did we would expect the same kind of approach for FitzPatrick going forward so we wouldn't see or anticipate any cash contributions to the decommissioning trust fund associated with decommissioning the plant.
Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Yes hi how are you.
Just in terms of the tax rate the 10% that is the cash tax rate.
Is that correct? Yes sir.
And what’s the expected book tax rate that we will see in earnings? Well the book tax rate as you know we don't usually give out a forecast for book tax rate until the prompt year.
There are definitely some things that could improve over the statutory rate that we’ve used in our forward-looking expectations but at that this point we’re not prepared to say exactly what those are.
There’s too many things going on in conversations with federal tax authorities state tax authorities state regulators to be able to successfully pin that down until we get closer to that time.
And then with respect to Slide 36 and it looks like you guys are going to be expensing the fuel and other things associated with FitzPatrick and Pilgrim as special items.
I'm wondering how will you guys be treating the revenue? Well the revenue will be operation – what we are going to be choosing to – not choosing what we will be treating as special items or things that would otherwise have been capitalized so any significant capital expenditures or in the case of Pilgrim refueling outage costs or fuel costs that would have normally otherwise been capitalized and amortized over coming cycles those will be considered special items and we’re just – I think for just the sake of making a clear which pieces are part of the ongoing operations and which pieces aren’t that’s the same approach that we used with Vermont Yankee and we think it’s more helpful that way.
We will try to be as transparent as possible about all the moving parts in there.
Okay then just in general with the economies of scale you have shut down three nukes in a pretty short period of time in the Northeast.
Is there an impact on the economies of scale of what is left meaning in the allocation of expenses or any thoughts on that? Yes there definitely is the lot of economies of scale I mean we manage our nuclear fleet as a fleet across the North and Southern utility nuclear assets.
So there is -- we have a lot of economies of scale but it will be shrinking over the retirement schedule in the next few years depending on how far you go with the retirement schedule depends on how much of an impact that economies of scale has for the Northeast we do have about $35 million of plant overhead at each plant and about half of that is direct costs.
And so beyond that we will be targeting a level of costs that are prudent for the business size and the size of the fleet going forward to make sure the plant stays safe and reliable.
Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Good morning guys.
Just to clarify you have said very clearly that you expect the 2016 and 2017 utility parent and other outlooks to be unchanged or at least I think that is what I heard.
But are you also saying that you are guiding prompt year -- beyond the prompt year your guide to statutory tax rate so is 2016 still good assuming a statutory tax rate or is that one of the things that might shift as you give us the drivers? It’s assuming the statutory tax rate we’re trying to hold quite frankly Jonathan the forward-looking stuff at EEI and we just removed it from this to do it at EEI next week.
But it seemed to raise some questions so the previous disclosure that was at the statutory tax rate that's what we were talking about.
And so you expect that to still be the case? And we hope that – to the earlier question about the effective tax rate I guess we would hope to do better than the statutory tax rate in ‘16 but we’re not prepared yet to identify that but taking that aside we still are at the current disclosure that we put forth previously.
If I may just on one other issue around guidance the ANO costs that you referenced those as I think $85 million which is the same number between ‘15 and ‘16 that was in the 10-Q.
Were those already in the guidance you showed us last quarter fully or is there an element of that being added in? No those are already fully baked into the guidance.
They were not in the guidance that we set up at analyst day last year.
Just to be clear so analyst day last year was when we originally set up our range of where we thought the midpoint could land between 435 and 475 and it didn't include ANO at that point and expected higher interest rates for pension benefits etc.
So there were several things that have moved around but ANO was specifically not included at that time but it is now.
And was it included when you showed us $3.65 last quarter – $3.65 is for ’15 just to be clear.
And it was not – we originally said $3.65 that was at the beginning of this year that’s before we had clarity around what ANO was going to be so it was not included in the $3.65.
So that’s part of the change to this $3.30 number? Yes that’s exactly right.
So the drivers between the 365 and 330 I think it’s in my script but it’s like $0.17 is related to ANO and I am sorry was that -- $0.06 O&amp;M and some other stuff.
So similarly on the ‘16 outlook that was the $35 million of ANO that you disclosed in the 10-Q would not have been in that range but you are saying the range is still good so something else must have offset it? That’s right what we said the lower end of the range is what we previously had said.
But that was again without the ANO drag am I right in that? That is with the ANO drag.
The lower end comment included the ANO drag but it wasn't in the ‘15 $3.65? That’s correct.
I think I am confusing you worse than than I really need to but our original guidance for ’16 was $4.35 to $4.75 where we said at the lower end that includes ANO.
For ’15 it was at $3.65 that did not include ANO but the $3.30 does now.
Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
So let me actually start where you guys just left off there.
In terms of weather normalized impact the 2015 update you just provided I know you just alluded to the ANO negative hit but you have had $0.23 if I have the year to date positive weather.
What is kind of the impact of the weather normalized sales year to date if you will? I believe that the weather normalized sales year-to-date – I don’t know – I can’t think of the year to date number off the top of my head.
For the full year I believe it’s $0.07 of which about $0.08 is residential.
So not weather just residential weather adjusted.
Turning to more strategic issues.
Looking at the nuclear business today how are you thinking about Indian Point? Is this something Indian Point Palisades is this something you would consider continuing to own just as two standalone units given the continued portfolio benefit of owning it in the context of the regulated business or is this something that you would imagine that you could arrive at a strategic juncture on? This is Leo.
I mean obviously we continue to evaluate what the best bring to do with those assets is but as we mentioned before and when they were talking about overheads a moment ago in that discussion we still have economies of scale and an operating capability with the nuclear assets and as Drew mentioned we do operate facilities as a fleet and we can continue to do that from an operational standpoint and so we’re prepared to do that doesn’t mean we aren’t looking at alternatives but as you know the alternatives around Indian Point are limited and we just have to go from here but obviously we can do it and we will if we have to and it’s not a problem for us but the strategic options obviously become limited given the regulatory approvals required et cetera.
And just a clarification therein.
The spring refueling outage on Pilgrim that is a final decision now that you intend to pursue that rather than retire going into that? We have not – in which year? The spring 2017 refueling outage have you committed to doing that or is there still the thought process you could buy back the capacity? No we have not committed to do that.
Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
A quick question.
On Jonathan Arnold's question you referenced 3.30 is that really be 3.35 I see on slide nine? Oh yes I apologize.
Yes it’s $3.35.
And year to date UPNO is at 3.55 so that imply we are going to have a loss in the fourth quarter? Is that including tax and weather the $3.30 is tax weather and special items adjusted.
But your year to date results are $3.55 at UPNO? I'm just trying to bridge from here to there.
That includes weather and taxes I believe.
So $3.35 does not include weather? That’s correct.
And then is $50 million this year and $35 million next year is still the right split for ANO? That’s correct Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
I wanted to just follow up on Fitzpatrick and check whether there are any limits on being able to put the plant into safe store or if there are other approaches being discussed that would be perhaps more rapid on actual decommissioning of the facility? Should we be assuming a long-term safe store option or is that still to be determined? Stephen this is Bill.
I think you should generally assume a safe store option we’re going to have to go through the process of getting a detailed decommissioning cost estimate we put together and then file our post shutdown activity report closer to the shutdown date but we are assuming the same type of approach we used at the Vermont Yankee.
Just on Indian Point there has been a series of extensions of the standstill agreement with the state of New York on sort of CZM related topics.
Should we be thinking given that they are having those extensions that there is very much an active dialogue going on there active discussions.
It struck me as likely that there are active discussions given the continued short-term extensions of that standstill.
Any color on the dialogue there? Stephen we have been in some active discussions but that standstill agreement date expired so we will go back to our position on that before we executed the standstill again we feel very confident our legal position that we had an effective withdrawal of the CGM application and as always we’re open to constructive discussions with state.
Our next question comes from the line of Thanks.
A couple of questions.
First Leo could you maybe give us some sense of how you kind of came at the dividend decision that you did in terms of just target payout or something of that sort? Sure Steve.
With the growth in investment and rate base and resulting earnings growth at utility parent and other as we have been mentioning for some time it’s our objective to provide the glide path into a consistent more predictable dividend path as we mentioned in the past we've taken more of I guess a lumpy approach to it where we raised it 29% one year and then we take a few years off and we raised it $0.10 or something like that.
So as we look out into the future consistent with our expectations around the growth in the utility parent and other segment of the business we’re kind of on a glide path so we would hope to provide a consistent growth that will work its way into that payout ratio over the next few years.
Which is the payout ratio target is at 65 to 75? Correct.
At any given time we might be over or even under depending on how we’re growing business and then obviously it takes into consideration the reinvestment that we have and the opportunity for the utility for all the items that I outlined that we put in the disclosures.
Different question on the nuclear just you guys historically used to have kind of top tier of nuclear operation so kind of having the ANO and Pilgrim kind of in this Tier 4 was definitely a change.
And I think there have been some changes in management and I am just curious what are the implications for the broader nuclear fleet at Entergy overall nuclear costs are these really just specific can issues just for these two facilities? First Steve we take the operation of the fleet obviously the safe secure reliable operations of fleet very seriously we did have a couple of issues that kind of compounded on each other at both facilities to get us into Column 4 we’d anticipate that this is not going to happen anywhere else and that will work our way out of this judiciously and expeditiously with the NRC over the coming couple years.
So it’s not costs like for the overall organization or the other plants related to that? No.
And then a last question just in terms of the Fitzpatrick decision there has been a decent amount of articles just on the political aspects of that potentially.
Is there any sense of any reaction we might see from this not only just at Fitzpatrick but also maybe Indian Point in terms of political regulatory stuff? That I can’t really comment on that Steve and we did work to try and come up with some way to extend the life of Fitzpatrick and we weren’t able to do that it's in everybody's best interests but it just wasn't possible.
But the state official worked just as hard as we did as I mentioned in my in my scripts to come to a solution and some thing is just difficult as you saw from the disclosures there is a lot of money lost at that facility and that’s certainly a difficult thing to overcome.
But we certainly aren’t out looking for any kind of political issues.
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Just curious on Fitzpatrick's decision can you give us a view of how material from an EPS and from a cash flow accretion and dilution the retirement is for 2017 and beyond? So from a cash flow perspective we are going to be cash flow positive over the next few years consistent with the disclosure there of 225 to 273 million so that’s the biggest piece I think that comes from the fact that we’re basically operating at a loss there and we’re also -- we would be incurring costs associated with capital and refuelling going forward.
So I think that – those are the biggest things from a cash perspective.
From a net income perspective there's a lot going on because of the impairments you’re going to see the costs associated with the refueling outages and fuel expense that we have those are going to be reduced considerably.
Obviously the depreciation is going to come way down.
The one thing that’s a little different for Fitzpatrick is the decommissioning costs the decommissioning expense that’s currently the fund is still sitting over with NIPA [ph] and so we won't see any changes there until a point where we actually get to fund and the liability over to us so that’s a little different than Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim going forward.
So those are some of the main drivers that you will see I think as we are thinking about the income statement for that business.
But I think my question kind of focused on the materialness -- if there is such a word -- of how earnings accretive would it be if I looked at 2015 run rate versus 2017 and beyond post-retirement and how cash flow accretive.
Directionally are we talking huge level of accretion or dilution to either of those tiny middle of the road? I think 225 275 million is that’s materially accretive to me in terms of cash.
The earnings piece – it’s going to be accretive but it’s not going to be hugely accretive upfront.
There will be some accretion in ‘16 and then in ‘17 we will start incurring the decommissioning costs and stuff like that.
We are going to provide some better transparency around what we think the drivers are at the EEI conference next week.
Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor Pickering Holt and Company.
Good morning.
Just wanted to clarify where you are with the industrial sales growth? Obviously it was better this quarter than last quarter but still not up to kind of the 5% that you are guiding to.
When do you expect to really ramp up and what are the factors that you are evaluating right now? Neel this is Theo.
You mentioned the 5% we were guiding to I think we stated the year at 4.4% in 2015 and what we have seen is our new and expansions have come on line they have come on line as we settled slower been delayed the ramp ups have been slower than anticipated but what we have also seen in the first two quarters of 2015 was we saw some low volumes with our existing customers and as you recall in the first couple of quarters that was really bigger -- had a big impact on the lower than expectations in terms of the industrial sales.
As Drew mentioned in script we saw it come back relative to that in the third quarter especially in our petroleum refinery area and from that perspective in that particular segment we expect to see that returning to the levels we somewhat expected as we go forward.
You also mentioned in the fourth quarter we’ve got an existing customer probably in the sector that is going through some outages and we won’t see likely not to see the volumetric changes in the fourth quarter that we saw in the third quarter but again those are outage rated and as Drew also mentioned you generally don’t see a relative relationship in terms of revenue change relative to volume change when that happens with existing customers.
In terms of the drivers I think we are seeing some things that others are experiencing stronger dollar kind of weaker commodity prices and it’s challenging our expectations as we said before what we see happening from early is delays and in some cases as I said ramp-ups not happening as soon as we had thought but we will provide more color around that at the EEI in terms of really diving more into what we expect to see in ’16 and going forward.
Just as a follow-up with the 2016 and 2017 Utility EPS is that more contingent upon rate base growth or sales growth? Are the two related over the next two or three years? How are you looking at that? Again I will start and Drew might also have comments relative to this but the two are related the growth as we all know and – this business is really driven by rate base at the end of the day and from our perspective our investment thesis is still intact and we see the opportunity that we laid out in the past continue to make investments that we talked about and it’s not so much depended upon the level of sales.
Sales is an opportunity for us to mitigate the impacts of those rate base growth changes and clearly with our sales volumes we have the opportunity to mitigate that probably much better than maybe some others that you see that don’t have the level of robustness as it related to sales growth.
Given – again the volumes do help in terms of getting to ROEs and as we’ve shown in slides before it’s really a combination of the two to some extent but again the growth is really tied to the investment thesis and that thesis from our perspective is still well intact.
This is Drew.
I will just add.
The big drivers are going to be getting the Union deal done and then the regulatory actions in Arkansas and Texas getting those resolved primarily to get the investment that Theo is talking about and the rates.
And then the sales growth is going to be helpful but it’s an element of lag reduction as we see it and there are some O&amp;M benefits out there we talked about earlier and that are rolling off hopefully by the end of next year.
And then we continue to see our pension expenses coming down and we do see some higher operating costs this year because of some of the nuclear compliance costs and other things that we see so we expect that to moderate a bit going forward as well.
So those are main drivers they’d shift a little bit as you go from ’15 to ’16 and then to ’16 to ‘17 but they are pretty much the same.
Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.
Good morning.
Make sure I understand this the ANO Column 4 enhanced inspections and the associated spending you see a path that that would be eliminated after next year? Yes that goal is to get out of Column 4 and reduce the compliance costs associated with being in that regulatory situation.
And then just a second question on the lower residential sales just an anomaly for the third quarter are you seeing more energy efficiency do you have any other color you can provide on that? Charles this is Theo.
As we’ve talked on previous calls like most other utilities we are seeing energy efficiency and products program as well as programs that we have specific to our space.
We generally talk in terms of organic residential growth in the 1% area and we see that somewhat being challenged through this year and we saw it somewhat last year as well.
In terms of third quarter we had two years where we had really – weather last year and fairly positive weather this year and when you see those swings like that year-over-year know sometimes the adjustment in terms of the weather for a period like that gets little challenged and we continue to watch and monitor the residential sales volumes also we saw 1 .2% growth in commercial in the quarter as well but it’s something we pay a lot of attention to and continue to look at.
I don’t know from our perspective we don’t see a kind of flat to negative as a trend but it is something for us to continue to monitor as it relates to our view of our organic residential growth.
Our next question comes from the line of Sharp Pareza [ph] with Guggenheim Partners.
Most of my questions were answered.
Just on FitzPatrick is there any situation where you can think of – or where you would have used dcom versus safe store? The safe store option is the one that gives you the most time to allow the fund to grow to meet your decommissioning needs.
So that seems like a likely candidate but I don't know if Bill wants to add anything in.
So again we will have to go through and calculate our cost we got 728 million in the fund and we will go through the same process of looking to forecasting when the fund would grow to have an adequate amount to begin decommissioning according to NRC you to have it fully funded before you can start so it will be some form of safe store probably won't go to the end f 60 years but depending on that cost estimate it will be out in the future so.
And then you don’t expect any indirect influence from New York to shut the plant down quicker.
No nothing that we are aware of at this time.
And then just what caused the talks to break down was it sort of – was an r-mark contract and option as a bridge so maybe a little bit of color on that? We’re not going to get into any of that.
We can explain the RMR issue we’re not going to obviously discuss any details of our discussion but we had -- we previously had the New York ISO do some analysis regarding the FitzPatrick plant as to whether or it qualifies as liability – and that most recent analysis indicates that it does not.
So we have submitted our notification -- shutdown notifications the PSC and the New York ISO as of today they will have to update that study but we certainly do not expect that answer to change.
And as Leo suggested all of our discussions with New York are really confidential and not appropriate for us to comment on any details.
End of Q&amp;A I’d like to now turn the call over to Paula Waters for any additional remarks.
Thanks Roland and thanks to all for participating this morning.
Before we close we remind you to refer to our release in website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statement.

This concludes our call.
Thank you.
Operator Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference.
This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.
Everyone have a wonderful day.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Waters Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please begin.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
We will begin today with comments from Entergy’s Chairman and CEO Leo Denault and then Drew Marsh our CFO will review results.
In an effort to accommodate everyone who has questions we request that each person ask no more than two questions.
In today’s call management will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties is included in the company’s SEC filings.
And now I will turn the call over to Leo.
Thank you Paula and good morning everyone.
Today we are reporting fourth quarter operational earnings per share of $1.58 consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter.
It was a good quarter overall although developments related to resolving lingering risks and uncertainties resulted in a few non-recurring expenses.
Namely we had two regulatory charges in utility related to longstanding matters and we reported two additional asset impairments reflecting the changes in strategic direction for the EWC business.
With those things now mostly behind us we have initiated 2016 guidance with the midpoint in line with our expectations.
We also affirmed our 2017 and 2018 utility parent and other financial outlook.
2015 was a pivotal year for us.
We accomplished much of what we set out to do working in the interest of all four of our stakeholders.
For our customers we began making investments in our long-term capital plan to continue modernizing our infrastructure and maintain a reliable and efficient system.
Meanwhile we control the overall cost in our customer bills and obtain new legislation and regulatory actions.
These accomplishments facilitate our ability to continue improving our service to customers.
Our employees we continue to purchase – to pursue our organizational health initiative soliciting feedback from our workforce and using it to strengthen our culture and enhance our organization.
For our communities we continued our focus on education putting particular emphasis on workforce development.
We began a $5 million 5-year workforce development initiative in partnership with the communities we serve.
The first round of grants will be announced soon.
We also contributed approximately $3 million throughout 2015 in support of education to organizations such as Teach for America STEM/NOVA Jobs for Americans Graduates and City Gear among others.
Our employees echoed our commitment giving more than 95 000 hours of their time to support education and other causes.
Combined with our work in other areas like assistance to low income families these contributions are accomplishing several objectives.
We are creating economic activity when trained and educated people enter the workforce.
We are creating valuable resources and a competitive advantage for our region helping to attract new businesses.
Our efforts work for us as we need new skilled employees.
And perhaps most importantly our efforts provide an opportunity to those that might not otherwise have one so that the cycle of poverty can be eliminated for a family for generations to come.
For our owners we successfully executed on our strategy designed to provide long-term growth and stability and therefore increased our dividend by 2.4% the first increase in more than 5 years.
We will continue working towards our objective of steady predictable dividend growth.
We also strengthened our credit profile as recognized by the major rating agencies with several positive changes in the outlooks for our ratings along with the rating upgrade for Entergy New Orleans by Moody’s.
Nevertheless in some ways 2015 was a year of challenges and evolution.
Our total shareholder return for 2015 was disappointing.
However our returns since September 30 have placed us second overall among our 20 utility peers.
Your positive reaction to successes and other actions since the third quarter of 2015 validates the momentum we see as we move into 2016.
At EWC we took steps to reduce volatility and gain clarity on the future of the business.
Closing Pilgrim and FitzPatrick was not the path we wanted to take.
After pursuing many alternatives they ultimately were the only options remaining for us.
We know they are tough decisions for those involved and we are committed to supporting our employees who work at these plants and their communities throughout this difficult transition.
I will take a moment now to expand more on some of our fourth quarter 2015 accomplishments beginning with the utility.
I have mentioned the necessity to continue to modernize our infrastructure and maintain a reliable system.
To this end our purchase of Union Power Station has received the necessary retail regulatory approvals.
One last approval was pending from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Upon closing the purchase of this plant will provide lower cost reliable generation to our customers for many years to come.
2015 also saw the start of a regulatory process for the St.
Charles generation project a 980-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plant to be constructed in Montz Louisiana.
We have requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of this new modern plant which will provide economic and reliable power for many years.
The targeted in-service date is June 2019.
In addition to approval of more than $700 million of transmission investments in all four states of our service territory as part of the Mid-Continent Independent System Operator or MISO MTEP15 process we initiated one of the largest transmission projects in our history.
This project includes two new substations expansion of two existing substations and 25 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines around the Lake Charles Louisiana area.
It will both enhance reliability for existing customers in that area as well as support new load in this growing region of Louisiana.
The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Public Need and Necessity at its business and executive session in December.
We expect construction to begin in the first quarter of 2016.
Our regulatory frameworks are now better aligned to facilitate future investments to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our system to benefit our customers.
We are seeing the results of this improved framework and the settlement of our Arkansas rate case.
The settlement reflects a net $133 million base rate increase and a 9.75% authorized return on equity effective at the end of February.
It also sets the framework for the formula rate plan with the future test year in the coming years.
The Arkansas Public Service Commission is expected to act on the settlement and issue an order later this month.
With this new regulatory structure we will have increased financial flexibility and ability to execute on capital investments in response to our customers’ needs.
Affirming this view Moody’s revised EAI’s outlook to positive in April following the adoption of the legislation allowing for a forward test year FRP and the filing of the rate case to use the new FRP.
Moreover the new regulatory structure will help Entergy Arkansas support economic expansion creating jobs for our customers in these communities and spreading fixed costs over more sales and helping to maintain the rate advantage.
We will be able to provide similar benefits to our customers in Mississippi as Entergy Mississippi’s first FRP with forward-looking features was approved earlier in 2015.
In addition we have been partnering with Mississippi state officials to help bring 2 500 jobs to Hinds County through a $1.45 billion tire plant in our service territory.
Mississippi lawmakers approved an incentive package for Continental Tires one of the top five worldwide automotive suppliers to build a new facility near Clinton.
This announcement further demonstrates how Mississippi is a premier location for automotive production as they join Nissan and Toyota in the state.
In Texas we are using some of the new rider mechanisms to provide similar financial flexibility and the ability to support the needs of our customers.
We have reached a settlement for an incremental increase to our distribution investment rider of just over $5 million effective at the start of the year.
The Public Utility Commission in Texas approved the settlement last week.
We also are nearing completion of the regulatory view of our request for an incremental $13 million revenue requirement under a similar rider for transmission investment.
We expect a proposal for decision later this month and the commission consideration in March.
Finally we reached a milestone on December 29 when we received the final approval from FERC to end the system agreement among Entergy Louisiana Entergy Texas and Entergy New Orleans the three operating companies that remain parties to the agreement.
This is an important step towards simplifying our regulatory structure and reducing risk and uncertainty for us and our customers.
It will allow us to put greater focus on the distinct opportunities that each of our retail regulatory jurisdictions as well as our core operations without the distractions from constant interregional litigation associated with this agreement.
Along with our plans for capital investment we are carefully monitoring the affect of these investments on our customer’s bills.
Based on the most recent EAI data our average rates are over 25% below the national average.
Historically low natural gas prices also have helped lower customer bills and are offsetting some increases in base rates.
As a result our customers will continue to benefit from some of the lowest rates in the country while also benefiting from a more modern and efficient electric system.
Looking back at EWC in the fourth quarter we have worked towards resolution on the future of each of our plants advancing our strategy to both provide capital to invest in other opportunities and to reduce risk and volatility from this part of our business.
We closed on the sale of our 583 megawatt Rhode Island CCGT on December 17.
This plant was a good investment for us its sale now frees up resources we can use to support other opportunities.
The New York ISO recently determined the retirement of FitzPatrick when combined with several other facilities will result in a resource adequacy shortfall in 2019.
However we expect there will be more cost effective solutions to fill this need.
And ISO New England determined that there is no reliability need associated with the Pilgrim retirement in June of 2019.
As a result we will move forward with plans to close both plants.
As we have said before these difficult yet necessary steps or not what we wanted.
On a positive note the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued the license amendments for Palisades reflecting updated guidance inspection and analysis on the reactor vessel head embitterment.
These amendments confirm that the plant needs the appropriate criteria to run till the end of its extended license and will not be forced into an early shutdown.
At Indian Point we continue to pursue license renewal in each of our plants to resolve the Coastal Zone Management Act and Clean Water Act requirements remains open.
The NRC confirmed that our timely application for renewal enabled the continued operation of the Indian Point following the original expiration date of the unit’s license this past December.
Additionally the NRC issued a draft update to the Indian Point supplemental and Environmental impact Statement which reaffirm the NRC’s previous conclusion that the environmental effects of Indian Point’s continued operation are not an obstacle to license renewal.
And lastly Vermont Yankee announced that it would be ready to begin the transfer of spent fuel into dry cast starting in 2017 2 years earlier than originally planned.
We are seeking approval from the Public Service Board for Certificate of Public Good so we can begin construction of the storage pad to complete the safe transfer to dry storage.
Now it’s time to look to the future.
Last year’s strategic accomplishments have ultimately set us up to undertake an equally ambitious list for 2016.
You can read the list on Slide 3.
Several of the items listed are related to closing out the regulatory agenda we began in 2015 and using the tools we have to execute on our capital investment plan.
These regulatory items include the now approved distribution rider and the pending transmission rider filings in Texas and making our first forward-looking formula rate plan filings in Arkansas and Mississippi as well as the second combined Entergy Louisiana FRP filing using a 2015 test year.
Also on our to-do list are steps which help continue to modernize and enhance our utility system.
As I said earlier we have requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of the St.
Charles power station.
We will make selections in our request for proposals for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas long-term resources in the coming months.
We will begin construction of the Lake Charles Transmission Project as well as numerous other significant transmission projects.
Lastly we continue to move forward with the process for installing smart meters on our utility system.
Smart meters are a foundational investment in the grid modernization opportunity I spoke about at EEI.
These types of investments are another way for us to lower costs and improve service for our customers.
Some benefits of it AMI include operational efficiencies timely information provided to our customers so they can better understand and control their usage and faster outage restoration and improved system reliability for our customers.
The next step involves further engaging our regulators and other stakeholders to discuss this investment and its associated benefits and we continue to evaluate other investments in the grid that can benefit our customers.
The operating companies anticipate making regulatory filings where applicable for the smart meter investment between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017.
A piece of the 3-year capital plan laid out in our slides today is earmarked for this initiative and we will share more with you over time on AMI as well as what might be next.
At EWC we continue to make plans and preparations for transitioning the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim nuclear plants to the decommissioning phase.
At Pilgrim we will make a decision by mid-year on whether to refuel the plant for another 2-year operating cycle.
I would like to take a moment to personally thank the more than 1 200 employees at both our Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants for staying focused on continued safe and secure operations.
I want to acknowledge their professionalism dedication and hard work throughout this time of transition.
After all the underlying objective that supports all of the initiative on the to-do list is the imperative to get the fundamentals right.
Without that nothing else works.
That means continuing to deliver safe reliable power and natural gas to our customers at the lowest reasonable cost.
These actions combined with our other ongoing initiatives will contribute towards meeting our objectives in the interest of all four of our stakeholders.
That is the execution of the journey we set out on 3 years ago.
We have set clear objectives to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders.
For owners deliver top quartile returns through steady and predictable utility and parent and other earnings growth and dividend growth while reducing risk particularly in the volatile commodity exposed generation business.
For our customers deliver top quartile customer satisfaction through anticipating customer needs and exceeding their expectations while keeping rates reasonable.
For employees we are on the top quartile score for organizational health by providing a stable environment with a healthy culture that provides clear direction to our employees and attractive opportunities for career development.
And for our communities where all of us live maintaining an active role in making things better.
This includes helping to bring jobs through economic development helping ensure we have a trained workforce available to fill those jobs giving both our time and financial support and operating in a socially and environmentally responsible way.
These objectives form the basis of our strategy investing in the utility to benefit customers while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predicable investment recovery providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make these investments and reducing volatility from our merchant business and freeing up resources to invest in other opportunities.
This strategy has given the plan for execution we laid out on the 2016 to-do list.
From objectives to strategy all the way through execution we have made great progress.
We have a clear vision for what we still must do.
We have the tools in place to do it.
We will talk more about this journey at our Analyst Day in June 9.
Please mark your calendars now and we will have more details as the day gets closer.
With that I will turn the call over to Drew.
Thank you Leo and good morning everyone.
Today I will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2015 results followed by our guidance for 2016 and our outlook to 2018.
But before we get into details the punch-line is that our results and expectations remain in line with all that we have discussed with you.
Now let’s jump into 2015.
Results for the quarter are summarized on Slide 4 of our presentation.
Operational earnings excluding special items were $1.58 per share up from $0.75 a year ago and in line with the expectations we shared last November.
Most significant special items include EWC’s non-cash impairment of our Palisades unit and the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center.
Operational earnings for the business increased due to tax items partially offset by utility charges warm weather and lower wholesale power prices.
Looking at utility parent and other results on Slide 5 operational earnings per share increased quarter-over-quarter.
The main driver was income tax as a result of the business combination for the two Louisiana operating companies which was completed in October.
This item contributed $1.50 to fourth quarter earnings after reserves to share $107 million with customers.
The customer sharing is reflected as a reduction in net revenue.
Unfavorable weather partially offset the tax items.
Slide 6 shows our adjusted view of utility parent and other earnings which excludes weather and normalizes for income tax items.
The adjusted view was lower than the same period a year ago.
However as Leo mentioned this quarter’s result included two charges totaling $0.35 per share.
Considering those charges the underlying business was in line with our November expectations.
Volume increased for both residential weather-adjusted sales and industrial sales.
Our residential growth was 1.6% and sales to industrial customers increased 0.6% as shown on Slide 7.
We continue to see gains for new and expansion projects adding approximately 300 gigawatt hours or 2.7% to our industrial sales this quarter.
However volume from existing industrial customers declined due primarily to weakness in the core alkali sector and an extended outage for a key customer which we mentioned last quarter.
Recently we have also seen weakness in the metals and wood product sectors.
On the positive side sales to existing petroleum refining customers increased on higher production due to continued favorable market conditions.
EWC fourth quarter results are summarized on Slide 8.
Operational earnings were $0.16 in the current quarter $0.23 lower than the fourth quarter of 2014.
The most significant factor was lower wholesale prices.
The nuclear fleet revenue was $44 per megawatt hour this quarter down from $54 in 2014 excluding Vermont Yankee.
Closure of VY contributed $0.05 to the decline.
Conversely the effects of last quarter’s impairments reduced fuel non-fuel O&amp;M and depreciation expenses which helped earnings $0.14.
Income tax variance of $0.13 also contributed to the offset.
Slide 9 shows operating cash flow this quarter about $50 million lower than the same quarter in 2014.
Biggest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC.
Now I will quickly go through full year results summarized on Slide 10.
Operational earnings for 2015 were $6 per share up from $5.83 in 2014 once again in line with the expectations we shared last November.
Higher earnings at utility parent and other drove the increase.
As shown on Slide 11 utility parent and other operational earnings share results were $4.97 in 2015 compared to $3.64 in the prior year led primarily by the aforementioned income tax items.
On Slide 12 adjusted utility parent and other results came in at $3.08 excluding weather and normalizing for taxes lower than in 2014.
As of the charges the fourth quarter adjusted EPS would have been $3.43 which was also in line with our previous expectations.
Slide 13 summarizes EWC operational earnings which declined year-over-year to $1.03 per share in 2015 from $2.19.
Lower prices were the largest driver accounting for $1.06 of the decline.
Another $0.20 was due to Vermont Yankee and the effects of the impairment provided a $0.14 offset.
Full year operating cash flow shown on Slide 14 was just under $3.3 billion in 2015 around $600 million lower than the prior year the most significant factors were about $300 million of Hurricane Isaac related securitization funds received in 2014 as well as revenue from our EWC business.
Now let me wrap up 2015 results.
We are initiating 2016 operational earnings guidance.
Details on our 2016 assumptions as well as sensitivities are provided in the appendix of our presentation.
Consolidated operational earnings per share guidance is $4.95 to $5.75 per share with the midpoint of $5.35 on Slide 15.
We are also issuing an adjusted utility parent and other guidance range of $4.20 to $4.50 per share with $4.35 midpoint consistent with our communications since last summer.
Recall that our adjusted measure reflects normal weather and statutory taxes.
The possibility exists for significant tax items this year as early as the second quarter but there is too much uncertainty to put those possibilities into the guidance at this time.
Starting with the utility parent and other adjusted view we expect $1.27 per share growth.
Rate actions and sales growth are the largest drivers as well as lower non-fuel O&amp;M and the effect of the 2015 utility charges.
Depreciation expense is also expected to increase by about $0.30 including Union.
The Union acquisition is expected to contribute a little more than $0.20 to the bottom line in 2016.
As you know we have not closed that transaction yet and 2016 earnings would be reduced about $0.02 for every month of delay.
The Arkansas settlement agreement as filed would help Entergy Arkansas move much closer to its allowed return levels.
We expect the Arkansas Public Service Commission to issue a decision soon.
Our industrial sales growth in 2016 continues to be driven by identified new and expansion projects in our service territory rather than our existing customer base.
Approximately two-thirds of our new and expansion projects are already in service to continue to reach steady low levels in 2016 and the remaining third comes from projects that are scheduled to come into service this year most of which are in the final stages of construction or early stages of testing.
Nevertheless these new projects continue to have timing and ramp rate risks which could impact results.
Our industrial sales are also exposed to market and commodity risks associated with the broader economy.
As a result of these risks our overall industrial growth expectation of 2016 is now at 2.9% and overall retail sales growth is at 1.9%.
We see utility non-fuel O&amp;M at about $2.5 billion or about $0.20 lower than 2015 due primarily to pension and OPEC costs which are expected to decline about $0.29.
This includes a slightly higher pension discount rate than we expected at EEI.
The change in the discount rate offset higher ANO Column 4 expenses now projected to be $50 million in 2016 about flat year-over-year.
We also anticipate lower expenses for fossil and nuclear in 2016 as well as higher expenses for the Union plant operations.
Turning to EWC its guidance midpoint is $1 per share about the same as the 2015 results.
Lower energy and capacity prices are expected to largely offset the effects of impairments recorded in 2015.
Effects from the 2015 impairments which affect multiple line items are $0.49 per share year-over-year.
Our guidance based on year end prices assumes average energy and capacity revenue of $48 per megawatt hour.
Despite our 86% hedge position there is $0.25 per share downside sensitivity to a $10 per megawatt hour drop in prices.
The prices have been lower by about $4 since the beginning of the year with the warm winter weather.
EWC’s pension and OPEB expense will also decline about $0.10 year-over-year offsetting higher Pilgrim Column 4 costs and inflation effects bring net non-fuel O&amp;M to a little less than $0.10 lower along with decommissioning trust earnings about $0.10 lower in 2016.
Looking ahead to first quarter results based on what we know today we are expecting operational earnings generally in line with first quarter consensus of around $1.10 per share.
This considers milder weather experienced so far this year including $0.07 of negative effect already in January and we don’t currently anticipate any significant tax items in the first quarter.
Moving to our longer term views Slide 16 shows our utility parent and other adjusted earnings per share outlook which is unchanged since EEI.
The foundation for our objective to achieve steady and predictable utility parent and other growth is rate-based growth from the utility investment plan.
The 2016 through 2018 capital plan is about $1.1 billion higher than the preliminary estimates provided at EEI but primarily because the Union acquisition was delayed into 2016.
As Leo discussed our capital outlook is also supported by regulatory mechanisms which provide increased financial flexibility to execute on capital plans and by longer term retail sales growth which can help mitigate rate effects for our customers.
We also see continued O&amp;M improvement as the assumed pension discount rate increases slowly over time and ANO Column 4 spending rolls off.
There could be some level of continued spending to maintain the ANO performance improvement upon Column 4 exit or additional cost as a result of the NRC’s inspection.
We expect any prudently incurred incremental cost to be recoverable.
The near-term changes to our sales growth for 2016 do not have an impact on our long-term 4% to 5% annual industrial growth expectations through 2018.
We continue to see large industrial projects coming online to drive the growth.
Overall our annual retail sales growth is still expected to be in the range of 2% to 2.5% which implies residential and commercial as slightly less than 1%.
Finally it is important to remember that our capital plan is driven more by our need to modernize our aging infrastructure and maintain reliability and less by our need to support load growth.
As a result our strategic objectives investment thesis dividend growth and resulting earnings outlook remain on track.
Slide 17 provides our EWC outlook for EBITDA with separate estimates for the nuclear plants that are closed or planned to be closed.
Current forecast is based on market prices as of year end.
As I mentioned market prices have declined since that time.
One other thing that we closely monitor is our cash and credit position.
Slide 18 summarizes our cash flow and credit metrics.
Efforts focused on improving cash flow and the de-risking the business create both value and stability.
Our goal is to remain solidly in the investment grade credit rating range for all our rated entities while we support the growth of the rest of the business.
Now on the slide but certainly germane to the credit position is our pension liability.
Despite a slight negative return on our pension assets in 2015 we were able to improve our funded status by about $250 million.
Although many factors impact that number reality is that we continue to take sustainable steps to manage our pension obligation in a methodical way.
This includes program changes liability management efforts and investment of nearly $800 million over the past 2 years.
Over the next 3 years we expect to contribute over $1.1 billion to our pension trust including almost $400 million in 2016.
Before closing I would like to acknowledge that David Borde is with us today on the earnings call.
We recently announced that David will assume Paula Waters’ role as Vice President of Investor Relations in mid-March.
You will have the opportunity to meet David on the road in the coming weeks.
David’s background on Wall Street both as a lawyer and an investment banker makes him a strong fit for the Investor Relations role.
He also worked as part of Entergy’s corporate development group before becoming a key team member supporting Theo and Utility strategy through his role as Director of Utility’s Finance Business Partners Group.
David will continue to pursue the standard of excellence we have strived to achieve in our disclosure and our relations with all of you.
At the same time Paula is not going far.
She has been given new responsibilities within utility where she will oversee top line growth strategies including economic development and revenue forecasting in support of the five utility operating companies.
We appreciate Paula’s remarkable tenure in Investor Relations as she has been instrumental and helping us clarify our discussions and strengthening our relationships with you the analyst community.
Thank you Paula.
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions.
Thank you.
[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.
Your line is open.
Hi good morning guys.
Good morning.
If I could jump to the back of the slide you have updated CapEx numbers the CapEx increased quite a bit from what you had at EEI part of that’s probably union slippage but can you just help us think about the rate base growth and the effect of bonus depreciation on the rate base growth net of the increasing CapEx? Dan this is drew.
And so we previously discussed that for the first couple of years we already had an expectation for bonus depreciation baked into our financials.
And so getting out to 2018 there is really not much impact on our overall rate based expectation in fact it still remains right in the middle of our previous ranges that we provided so really quite minimal impact on us overall through the guidance range or through the outlook range.
And then what was the rest of the increase beyond union to fill on the ‘16 to ’18 CapEx? I think it was mostly just minor project adjustments.
I do think that there is any major elements in there that would be worth calling out at this point I don’t think.
And I guess on load growth and kind of the expectations for that number to bounce back after maybe a little bit slower for ‘16 than expected where do you rank your confidence in that reset in growth today versus say six months ago or at the last Analyst Day and what is the visibility to that underlying industrial gain? Dan this is the Leo.
I think from our perspective we would rank that confidence higher a little higher than we had say few years ago at the analyst meeting because primarily a lot of the projects have advanced relative to that point in time and also we have gotten a better line of sight on what’s really happening from an economic perspective as it relates to what you are seeing with commodity markets.
As we talked about at EEI as you look ‘15 through ‘18 basically 95% of that growth or what we call new and expansion projects were related to projects that were in advance stages.
And we continued to see that to be the case.
That’s not to say that we see some projects smaller projects maybe falloff as we have gone forward.
And if you also recall at EEI that 95% about 70% was made up of basically a handful of large projects that were in advance stages and those projects were primarily in the steel and ethane cracker we did have an LNG project.
We also have projects in the ammonia area as well as methanol.
So it was spread across a lot of various segments.
As we continue to get closer and as we move closer in time to the expected construction data completion dates of these projects clearly we get more visibility around where those projects are just by the sheer passage of time.
I think the other thing that we have gotten more visibility around is what’s going on with our existing customers and got more granularity as to what’s happening in that particular area.
We don’t really see much growth when we talk about the 4% to 5% coming from our existing customer base.
But as we have talked about in the past our existing customers are large industrial customers are on fixed rate – fixed demand charge type contracts and so while we may see any volumetric fluctuations we really don’t see accompanying fluctuations in revenue when you talk about downside situations.
So I think our confidence is higher.
I mean clearly as Drew said in his script there are still existential factors that can affect what we are seeing.
But we monitor this on a very regular basis and we need to try to get as much intelligence around this as we possibly can both from a customer perspective as well as the macroeconomic perspective.
So you are not seeing erosion in these existing customers because of an economic slowdown kind of on a global basis so you are not expecting them to do worse you would expect them to stay where they are is that effectively embedded in guidance? I mean I would expect that there is always the risk they could do worse.
But we have adjusted our expectation around that group based on what we see and what we know today.
And we did adjust it downwards as compared to where we were a number of months ago.
Dan this is Drew.
And of course you have seen in the last couple of quarters we have seen lower growth in the industrial sector but the new and expanding customers have been growing in the industrial space about 3% and existing customers have been detracting from it about 2.5%.
So we are expecting a little bit of that same thing in 2016.
Okay got it.
Thank you guys.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.
Your line is now open.
Hi good morning.
Good morning Julien.
So just a follow-up a little bit on Dan’s last question if you will can you comment on sort of the non-industrial trends I suppose just if we try to look at the mix 60-40 I suppose it would imply something shifting there as well but I will let you elaborate? Julien are you relating to just the ‘16 period or the same period Dan was referring to? Actually let’s stick with ‘16.
Okay.
I think when we think about growth in kind of the non-industrial sector for ’16.
First I would start by saying if you look at the quarterly GSP across the Gulf South region we see numbers probably anywhere from 2.5% to 4% in the ‘16 ‘17 timeframe.
Also I think if you look at what we have experienced even in ‘15 for the companies within that region we have residential sales growth ranging from 1.5% to about 3.5% on a weather adjusted basis.
We had commercial sales growth basically in the 1% to 2% on a weather adjusted basis in that area.
And so as we look forward we see for example on the commercial side major projects that happened in ‘15 that will have a full year effect in ‘16 that contribute to what we view as a fairly reasonable sales growth expectation on the commercial side.
In the residential area we do – are seeing pockets of what we call maybe the multiplier effect related to the industrial growth that we see again in that Gulf South Gulf Coast regional area.
And I would also say that one thing that we take advantage of in 2016 is another day of kilowatt hour sales that have some small impact on our expectation in 2016 as well.
So around 1% which is where we are when you adjust when you take out the total growth and the impact of industrial again macroeconomic effects we see – or impacts we could see at the industrial level we could see at the residential and commercial.
But we have as I said in response to Dan’s question we have done a lot of work around updating our expectations relative to that.
And at this point we feel fairly comfortable with where we are.
Just to be clear that you are saying not much of a change on the non-industrial? I would say you mean ‘15 over ‘16 in terms of not much of a change or that was just where we were thinking… Yes exactly.
If you look at ‘15 weather-adjusted I think residential was about 0.6% commercial was about 0.4%.
I think what we are seeing in ‘16 and our assumption is something closer to 1%.
And that’s consistent with where we were at sort of EEI November timeframe.
The residential commercial expectations haven’t changed much.
Got it.
And just a quick clarification if you can on the expectations for FitzPatrick and the retirement timeline is there any scenario here that you could be looking at implementing a ZEC or whatever you want to call it scheme perhaps margin positive presumably? Julien this is Bill.
At this point in time there is no clarity or certainty around what that program is and what the actual value associated with it would be.
So we have no plans as it relates to changing our focus on shutting down that plant on January 27.
We do support the concept of a clean energy standard and I think that that makes sense but we really need to understand the details of it and assure that it is actually implemented.
Excellent.
Thank you.
Thank you Julien.
Thank you.
And the next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.
Your line is open.
Good morning.
Good morning.
We are going to miss Paula.
But anyway I just want to touch base on the Palisades impairment and how that impacts – well the Palisades and I guess the other impairment in the wind and what have you and how that impacts 2016 guidance? If I heard you correctly you said there was a $0.49 impact that I understand it’s sort of complicated so I don’t want you to go through any laborious detail.
But just in general so if you could highlight what that is? Did I hear that correctly I guess I mean… Yes.
So Paul it’s Drew.
A couple of things there.
So I think that it’s spread across a couple of different categories when you think about these impairments.
There is an impairment piece that’s in net revenue for fuel.
There is an impairment piece which is in O&amp;M for refueling outage expenses and then there is an impairment piece which is in depreciation for the asset itself.
And so we have actually broken down for you in the back in the appendix on Slides 46 and 47 we give a lot of detail about the plants that are sort of ongoing and the plants that are planned to be closed or are closed and talk about where you can see those impairment effects for those three buckets.
Those impacts – I mean the impairment was done in the fourth quarter.
Did those impacts – how do they go into 2017 I guess? Into 2017? Yes.
I mean are they continuing or how do you follow what I am saying it just seems like a large number? Yes.
Well I mean it is.
I mean if you think about all those plants that were impaired they are still going to be operating in ‘16 so you are still going to see the effects of that stuff.
Once you get into ‘17 as Bill said and we announced on January 27 we will be shutting down FitzPatrick so you won’t see those same kind of effects as that starts to fall away.
But Pilgrim and Palisades will still be there.
So you will still see those effects for those plants continue to go on.
Now once we refuel Pilgrim I guess it will be a little bit different if we make that decision.
And that would be I think those costs would be expensed if we go down that path.
And so it will change things a little bit at that point but you will still continue to see those impairment effects for those two assets because they are still operating potentially beyond ‘17.
I guess what I am wondering is with respect to Palisades I mean what caused this big write-off in the contracted plant? It wasn’t completely clear to me is it just the lifespan has been changed or your market expectations after the contract has expired? Yes.
So I think what changed there is the fact that we made decisions around the other single unit assets.
So Pilgrim FitzPatrick and Vermont Yankee were all single unit assets.
Palisades was the only remaining one out there although it did have the contract.
Because of our decisions for the other three we had to again more closely assess the probabilities associated with the life expectancy of the Palisades unit.
And when we did that it failed the accounting test for the impairment.
And we are continuing to operate the plant till 2022.
The operational decision is different than the accounting decision.
We will make a decision around Palisades when it’s appropriate to do that out in the future and that will depend on the circumstances that exist at that time the market conditions at that time etcetera.
But from an accounting perspective we are forced by our other actions to take a close look at the Palisades unit.
Okay.
And then just finally on the midpoint outlook it’s a $0.40 range just in terms of the term midpoint how should we think about that? Is there some range outside of that that we should be thinking about or just elaborate a little bit on that terminology? This idea was something that we originated the idea of a midpoint outlook back at Analyst Day in 2014.
And our expectation at that point of time was that by the time we got out to that date because it was pretty far out there that our midpoint expectation might shift around a little bit.
And so what we tried to do is signal to everybody about where it would land.
But when we get out to that point we would give you the actual guidance and give you a midpoint for where that would be.
So I guess similar to ‘16 where we landed at $4.35 which was at the bottom of our range of potential midpoints.
I guess there could be a little bit above or below the ranges that we are talking about.
But so I guess the answer to your question directly yes there could be a little bit above or below in those out-years but we are not at this point communicating anything differently than just the range that we have.
Paul this is Leo.
Just this may or may not be helpful but what we expect is the midpoint of the guidance to fall within that range.
Excellent.
Thanks a lot.
Apparently that was more helpful than any.
And the next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
Your line is open.
Hi good morning.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Good morning Steve.
I wanted to just add on to Paul’s question on thinking about Slide 47 and then also Slide 40.
There are number of line items.
But I guess in total when we look at some of these nuclear plants that maybe shutting down at some point in the future because I understand I guess you are including the revenues from power generated but some of the expenses are not included in sort of adjusted earnings.
On a total basis from these nuclear units what’s the amount of expense that is effectively going to be excluded from adjusted earnings for these plants in say ‘16 or beyond? In ‘16 I think it’s about $50 million of capital that would fall into that category and I think that’s on Slide 40.
And then I think if there are any fuel expenses if we would make that again that decision to shutdown Pilgrim there could be some additional expenses that ends up in that same category.
But I think that’s what we will be talking about Stephen mainly.
Okay.
So $50 million you said capital would that be something that would be an expense but will be excluded from adjusted earnings or is that CapEx I wasn’t clear on that? Well it is – it would otherwise be considered capital but because of the situation where those plants are expected to shutdown the accounting will force us to put that as an expense.
So you will see it in the as reported as an expense that $50 million in capital.
We will break it out for you as a special item so you can understand what that is.
But that’s the way it would be portrayed I believe in the financial statement.
Okay.
And what amount of fuel expense is being excluded from adjusted earnings? I don’t know that – have that number in front of me right now so we will have to give that to you later Stephen.
Okay understood.
And then on ANO in column four I think you laid out pretty clearly the cost of I believe $50 million in 2016 could you give a little color in terms of your assumption in the plan in terms of when you are able to move that out of column four and sort of what are the key challenges or steps that need to be taken to make that happen? I will answer that.
So just from a financial perspective we don’t have any costs beyond 2016.
From an operational perspective in the NRC I think there is a longer process there that goes on.
And so while we may stop incurring costs it may be a little bit longer into 2017.
I think there is a possibility it could go even longer than that but I don’t believe that would be necessarily our expectation that the NRC would make a rating change there.
Okay understood.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The next question is from Praful Mehta of Citigroup.
Your line is open.
Hi guys and Paula you will be missed and welcome David.
So a quick question on the capital plan and your point that it’s the aging infrastructure that drives the growth and the CapEx not as much the load growth.
But I am assuming at some point you do need load growth to kind of maintain your competitive rates and keep that rate and attract more I guess CapEx and more load into the region.
So what is the minimum load growth that you look at from an industrial perspective given the decline in load growth at least for 2016 how would you see the load growth out in the future and is there a minimum level that you would track to say you need that kind of load at least in terms of load growth to support the CapEx plan while keeping the rates in check? So Parful that’s a good question.
One thing to keep in mind as you look at that capital plan as you said the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by new technologies improve the heat rate cost efficiency the environmental output of the new plants plus the old plants get older and more costly.
So as time progresses certainly we have the ability to benefit our customers with a more reliable more environmentally friendly and lower production cost unit.
And so we are doing that over time just like anyone would.
It just so happens that this kind of seems to happen in big chunks in terms of when the facilities are required.
So we are in the process of doing that.
Recall that we have never been long generation also so we are short – we anticipate being short generation out into the middle of the next decade even with if we were to have significantly lower growth.
So the need for the generation will continue to exist and what we have mentioned before is we have some flexibility around the timing as it relates to the CTs.
We have the deactivations of the units and certainly PPAs that roll off that are all part of the mix.
So it’s a combination of the need but it’s also us making sure we have a risk mitigation strategy for the company and for its customers associated with how we put that in place.
So I know there is no – at this industrial load growth number that we would give you that we say we no longer need this investment.
But the fact of the matter is we would continue to be short with the ability to be in MISO and utilize the market over time as we go out there.
And we won’t see that changing under too many scenarios.
The transmission investment is driven in large part by changing reliability requirements similar type of activity as it relates to new technologies and the ability to improve the operations of the system as we go forward plus again the age of the infrastructure requires some upgrading as well.
As does our entry into MISO provide us with the opportunity to make deliverability of assets that before we couldn’t into the market going forward as well.
So in the transmission that we are doing from a reliability standpoint a lot of that like the Lake Charles project a lot of the load that we are going to serve there is already there so it’s beefing up of the reliability improving the infrastructure plus load growth that we already see under construction.
So that’s pretty solid as well under a variety of load growth scenarios.
And then as we talked about before we are also embarking on the MI side of things and as we go forward there could be other things that would certainly show up that could either replace things that may or may not fall out or upwards than that capital growth going forward on the distribution side which is going to become more and more important again in the benefit – to benefit our customers.
So I guess the bottom line here is there is an opportunity for us to continue to invest this capital because of structure is and where the state of the technology is.
And we are also managing it in a real risk mitigation kind of strategy.
Again not getting long on the generation side not getting out of our skis on the transmission side and I would like to make sure that we are well within the balance of anything that might happen on a load growth point of view.
But you are right the main benefits that we have from load growth are that it continues to provide us with that competitive advantage whereas I mentioned in my script we are today over 25% below the national average in our rates that contributes to our ability to attract new business into the region so that we have the capability to do that more.
And so things like the Continental Tire example that I mentioned and all the steps that’s under construction that Leo mentioned all of those in addition to us managing our cost levels the decline in natural gas prices all of that go to contribute to that rate advantage continuing and hopefully growing over time.
And so you can’t really say at what load growth you not do the capital it’s very robust over a variety of load growth scenarios but we have to be mindful of the risk mitigation strategies that we would in place when we build those new plants or those CTs but also other costs pending that we can do as it relates to our normal O&amp;M fuel costs and production costs as we put these new plans in place for example that help us maintain that advantage.
That’s kind of – it’s more complicated than just one number I guess would be the answer.
But it’s pretty robust across a variety of load growth scenarios.
Got it.
Thank you Leo.
That was extremely helpful color.
And finally just a quick question on taxes I know you had reduced your NOL balance I think on the last call now with bonus helping you as well do you see yourselves being cash tax payers through the ‘18 ‘19 timeframe or it is the minimum tax cash tax during that period? Praful I think what we said is we expect our cash tax rate to be around 10% through that period that you are talking about.
And as I mentioned earlier bonus depreciation was baked in for a good bit of that so we would expect it to be about the same over that timeframe.
Got it.
Thank you guys.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And the last question will come from Charles Fishman of Morningstar.
Your line is open.
Thank you and good morning.
On Arkansas Leo I recall that when you took your current position this was one of your top three goals was to get an improved regulatory framework in Arkansas and now that you have it I guess looking back and again I thought you said that your strategy was to tell Mississippi – or excuse me to tell Arkansas that look at the industrial development in Mississippi if you have a favorable regulatory framework that can certainly support that development I guess my question is was that the argument that helped win the day number one.
And I guess a related question would be is there anymore tweaking you would like to see in Arkansas maybe besides a little higher allowed ROE? Well I would say first of all there is no argument that we have had with anybody on anything.
And I know you just used that term but I don’t want that to be a term that’s out there.
The fact of the matter is that all of our jurisdictions Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi Texas all of them we are all interested in the exact same thing.
We are all interested in growing the economies of the jurisdictions in the states in which we operate and same with the city of New Orleans.
We have spent a lot of time with all those jurisdictions including Arkansas sitting down with them.
Our jurisdictional CEOs have done a wonderful job.
Their regulatory folks have done a wonderful job.
Theo has done a wonderful job of making sure that we sit down and find common ground with all of them around bettering the economy of the state.
And Charles I started out with the four stakeholders and our objectives for them around the first quartile TSR first quartile customer satisfaction etcetera we bring jobs to the state we do good for the company we could do good for the community we could do good for the employees it’s great for the political environment as well.
So all we have done is we have sat down and discussed that with our regulators as well as the politicians in our regions to describe to them our desire to participate in that with them and help them achieve their objectives.
And so what we have crafted in Texas with riders in Arkansas with the forward-looking FRP with Mississippi with the forward features at FRP the way assets are recovered in Louisiana and New Orleans etcetera.
What we have accomplished with them is that common ground about how giving us the financial flexibility to make you all comfortable with the investments that we have through the regulatory process helps us attract the Big River steels the Sasols of the world the Continental Tires of the world to come to our region to buy power from us to help us invest in the infrastructure and create tens of thousands jobs.
We are working on this together to be able to do that.
So I wouldn’t say that anybody won the day in Arkansas other than the State of Arkansas and we participated in that in a small way and they worked together with us to create something that allowed us to do that.
And I would say that it’s no different than the workforce development program that I mentioned in my script.
We are spending $5 million over the next 5 years to help train people to work at those plants that we have helped attract.
And that’s good for all four of our stakeholders as well as we do that.
So it really has been the last few years of extraordinary collaboration foresight buyer regulators and us listening to them as much as them listening to us.
Is there anything in Arkansas with respect to regulatory framework that you would like to tweak? Well I am not sure that that’s something that we would need to do a lot of at the moment.
Certainly there is always things that we want to accomplish but really that’s going to depend on the environment as we go forward we go forward with the grid modernization we go forward with AMI we go forward with different things than what we have today that might require some further collaboration with those folks.
But right now we have got to make a filing under the first forward-looking FRP and get that underway before we started worrying about changing things.
Okay.
Well I think you are being a little modest because I know this was one of your goals in Arkansas and I think you did accomplish it so congratulations.
And that was my only question.
Alright thank you.
Thank you.
And at this time I would like to turn the call back over for closing remarks.
