Thanks John.
Today we're pleased to report strong first quarter results as we delivered higher-than-expected sales growth of 17.4% and higher-than-expected ongoing earnings per share of $0.91.
This is above our previous guidance range of $0.88 to $0.90 and reflects growth of 12.3%.
As you may have noticed in our earnings release this morning in addition to providing the same division and product-level disclosure as in the past you'll also see that we're presenting our businesses in three categories based on their underlying attributes.
Durable Growth businesses include our branded Generics business called Established Pharmaceuticals as well as Nutritionals Core Diagnostics and Diabetes Care.
These businesses are less dependent on significant R&amp;D investment at minimal patent risk and operate in generally stable markets.
In the quarter Durable Growth sales were up more than 24% globally including the contributions from the Solvay Pharmaceuticals and Piramal Healthcare Solutions acquisitions.
Our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business primarily includes patented pharmaceuticals around the world as well as an evolving pipeline to drive growth longer term.
Global Proprietary Pharmaceutical sales increased nearly 12% in the quarter.
And our Innovation-Driven Device businesses include Vascular Molecular Diagnostics and Vision Care.
These businesses require a moderate level of R&amp;D investment with resulting pipeline products generating significant revenue and profit contribution.
Global sales of Innovation-Driven Devices increased more than 10%.
John and Larry will walk through the businesses underlying these categories in more detail.
But I wanted to touch on our presentation of the businesses since it's new this quarter.
Also new in our release is the disclosure of our Established Pharmaceuticals division as well as emerging markets sales by business which is in the Q&amp;A section of the news release.
Given our strategic efforts to build these areas of our company we're providing this additional information to give investors a greater appreciation of the opportunity that exists in branded generics and in emerging markets across our businesses.
Our emerging markets sales in the quarter were $2.3 billion an increase of 38% including the impact of acquisitions.
Adjusted for acquisitions emerging markets sales growth still exceeded 20% underscoring the importance of these markets to Abbott's overall growth profile.
Turning back to our performance in the quarter.
Sales growth was 17.4% including a favorable 1.3% impact from exchange rates as the U.S.
dollar weakened as the quarter progressed.
Sales growth in the quarter included the contribution from the Solvay acquisition which closed in the first quarter of 2010; and the Piramal acquisition which closed in the third quarter of 2010.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions in exchange organic sales growth in the quarter exceeded 6% in line with our guidance for the full year.
I've note that we've now left the impact of the Solvay acquisition.
The adjusted gross margin ratio of 58.5% increased 110 basis points in the prior year of 57.4% due to improved product mix.
The favorable comparison to the prior year was partially offset by additional rebates on the U.S.
Healthcare Reform the carryover effect to 2010 pharmaceutical pricing actions by European governments and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate on the ratio.
The movement in foreign exchange rate in the quarter benefited our top line but actually negatively impacted the gross margin ratio by approximately 120 basis points compared to our forecast in January.
Excluding this impact the gross margin ratio was in line with our previous forecast of a ratio approaching 60%.
Those of you who followed our results in recent years are aware that as exchange rates have fluctuated significantly a rapid weakening of the dollar contributes to our top line immediately but puts some pressure on gross margin ratio in the quarter the rates move.
The ongoing tax rate was 15.7% in line with our previous forecast for the quarter.
Now let's turn to our outlook for 2011.
Today we're confirming our full year 2011 ongoing earnings per share guidance of $4.54 to $4.64.
We're also issuing second quarter ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.10 to $1.12.
The midpoint of this EPS range represents approximately 10% growth over the prior year in line with the guidance we provided in January.
We forecast specified items at $0.13 in the second quarter reflecting integration costs from past acquisitions and costs of previous restructuring actions.
We're forecasting high-single digit sales growth in the second quarter and a favorable impact from exchange on sales of approximately 2.5%.
We're forecasting R&amp;D at around 9.5% of sales and SG&amp;A at approximately 28% of sales.
This reflects SG&amp;A leverage compared to 2010 despite our continued investment in emerging markets infrastructure across the businesses and the negative impact with the pharma tax associated with U.S.
Healthcare Reform which as you recall is charged to SG&amp;A expense.
Regarding our tax rate for the remainder of the year companies with operations in Puerto Rico now have clarity around the required treatment for the excise tax that the Puerto Rican government established effective January 1 of this year.
While there is no significant bottom line impact from this tax on Abbott payment of the tax will impact certain P&amp;L ratios mainly our gross margin ratio and tax rate starting in the second quarter.
Because the tax is an excise tax the gross amount payable will be recorded as an increase in product cost reducing our full year gross margin ratio by approximately 30 basis points.
The U.S.
tax credit however will be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense effectively reducing our income tax rate.
We now project a tax rate of around 15% for the full year 2011.
We expect the rate to vary somewhat across the remaining quarters of 2011 at the second quarter at approximately 15% to 15.5%.
Again the net bottom line impact of the excise tax is not significant for us due to the fact that it's creditable for U.S.
income tax purposes.
Regarding gross margin for the second quarter we're forecasting adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59.5% reflecting underlying favorable product mix and efficiency initiatives offset by the impact of U.S.
Healthcare Reform; the carryover effects of 2010 European pricing measures; the Puerto Rican excise tax; as well as the impact of exchange on the ratio.
So in summary we're off to a great start in 2011 with strong performance across our businesses and delivering more than 12% ongoing EPS growth.
This type of performance is the result of our broad-based strategy and competitive strengths.
We're in many different innovative healthcare fields and we're constantly evolving in shaping our product portfolio with the mix of Durable Growth prospects and strong cash-generating businesses that will continue to sustain us longer term.
We built Abbott to continue to deliver sustainable top-tier financial performance and our outlook for double digit ongoing EPS growth in 2011 continues Abbott's track record as a leader among our healthcare peers.
And with that I'll turn it over to John for the business operating highlights.
Thanks Tom.
As Tom mentioned we've made some additions to our earnings news release and are presenting sales from our three key business categories in a new way.
These changes are supplemental to the information we've always provided and are intended to help shareholders understand the strategic mix of our diversified model as well as the significant growth opportunity in emerging markets.
So today Larry and I will walk you through these three new categories.
I'll start with our Durable Growth and Innovation-Driven Device businesses and then Larry will give you an overview of our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business as well as our Pharmaceutical pipeline.
Let me start with our Durable Growth businesses.
In Established Pharmaceuticals which includes international sales of our branded generics portfolio we reported global sales of approximately $1.3 billion including the contribution from Solvay and Piramal Healthcare Solutions.
The Solvay integration and Piramal transition activities are continuing along and we're pleased with their progress and performance.
Our large portfolio of Established Pharmaceuticals consists of hundreds of branded generic products expanding primary care therapeutic categories.
The depth of our portfolio and the diversity of our geographic footprint help us drive durable sustainable performance.
We continue to expect approximately $5 billion in Established Pharmaceuticals sales this year in 2011.
In our worldwide Nutritionals business global sales increased 7.8% driven by strong double-digit growth internationally.
In the United States sales were down 1% in the quarter.
And as we mentioned on the fourth quarter call we expected a difficult comparison in our U.S.
Nutritionals business during the first half of this year as we work to recapture share in our Infant Formula business.
Our plan to recover our Similac business is on track.
We have successfully maintained our number one hospital share position and this continues to help us drive consumption at the retail level.
We've increased our shares since the fourth quarter and anticipate better sales growth in particular as we head into the second half of this year.
We also saw strong growth this quarter in our PediaSure business driven by strong execution share gains and the launch of our new PediaSure SideKicks product line.
Similarly in our U.S.
Adult Nutritional business as the market leader we continue to pioneer nutritional advancements with our Ensure brand.
Our new Ensure Muscle Health product line features a proprietary ingredient Revigor and protein to help rebuild muscle and strength naturally lost with age.
There are approximately 140 million Americans currently over the age of 40.
And I'll be one of them which represents a significant opportunity for our Ensure product line.
Outside of the U.S.
sales increased nearly 16%.
This was driven by continued strong growth in emerging markets which comprises the majority of our international Nutritional sales.
This quarter our emerging markets sales for the Nutritional business were nearly $600 million and that's up more than 18%.
This was driven by impressive performance in Asian and Latin American markets where we continue to see strong underlying market growth and increased penetration as we launch a cadence of new products.
For the full year 2011 we're forecasting more than $2 billion in emerging market Nutritional sales which we expect to double over the next five years.
So as we look ahead to the second quarter in our Global Nutritions business we expect worldwide sales growth in the high-single digits.
In the U.S.
as we stated previously we continue to expect U.S.
sales to be down mid-single digits due to the difficult comparisons in our Infant Nutritionals business from last year.
Conversely in our International Nutritionals business we expect continued double-digit growth in the second quarter.
In our Global Diabetes business worldwide sales increased 10% this quarter with U.S.
sales up approximately 5%.
International sales increased 14% driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets.
We continue to grow our retail prescription share through expanded customer outreach and patient education.
We also continue to improve our operating margin in this business through cost reductions and a focus on more favorable customer mix.
So looking ahead to the second quarter in our Global Diabetes business we expect low- to mid-single digit sales growth.
In our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business which includes immunoassay and hematology global sales in the first quarter were up nearly 7%.
Instrument placements in emerging markets such as China continue to help drive international sales growth.
In our U.S.
business we continue to expand our menu of assays and recently submitted to the agency a new ARCHITECT Assay to measure Vitamin D.
Vitamin D deficiency impacts as many as 1/3 of Americans and can impair calcium absorption risking the health of bones and muscles.
In the second quarter in our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business we expect low- to mid-single digit sales growth.
In our Point of Care Diagnostics in the first quarter sales increased 8%.
We recently received FDA clearance for a new wireless version of the i-STAT point of care testing system.
This new system allows caregivers to wirelessly download i-STAT diagnostic test results directly to a patient's electronic medical record without leaving the bed side.
Faster access to test results may lead to better care overall.
And so for the second quarter in Point of Care Diagnostics we expect double-digit growth.
So let me turn now to our Innovation-Driven Device businesses.
We start with Molecular Diagnostics where global sales in the first quarter were up 13% driven by international sales growth of more than 25%.
We continue to gain share worldwide as we expand the m2000 menu.
In Europe we launched three new infectious disease assays for the platform: Our new Qualitative HIV-1 Assay expands the way caregivers can collect and test patient samples; our new CMV assay will help physicians monitor for a virus common in transplant recipients.
And our new HPV sequencing test identifies genomic sequences of a hepatitis B virus to help better monitor and treat HPV.
Also in the quarter in our Ibis business we introduced a nonclinical assay on the PLEX-ID System that's designed to detect numerous pathogens that can pose serious health threats to human health food water and other resources.
Our PLEX-ID System is changing the way viruses bacteria and other microorganisms are identified in research laboratories by not requiring technicians to predict the testing outcome.
PLEX-ID technology has been deployed in 20 sites around the U.S.
including the CDC and the FDA.
So in the        second quarter in Molecular Diagnostics we're expecting again double-digit growth.
In our Vision Care business worldwide sales were approximately $270 million in the first quarter.
Globally we continue to gain share in our Cataract business with our TECNIS multifocal and monofocal IOLs.
We also continue to grow share in our Corneal business with our new RevitaLens contact lens solution.
As we look ahead to the second quarter in Vision Care we'd expect mid- to high-single digit sales growth.
Let me turn now to our Vascular business where sales in the first quarter increased 13%.
International vascular sales which is more than half of our total Vascular business increased nearly 37% in the quarter and our sales in emerging markets increased 45%.
International markets comprised 2/3 of the global drug eluting stent market.
And in emerging markets procedure volume is growing at a midteens rate.
Abbott is particularly well positioned internationally and has seen impressive performance with both XIENCE and our next-generation XIENCE PRIME drug eluting stent.
We have 35% share of the international DES market currently based on our strong positions in Japan Southeast Asia as well as Europe with nearly 20% of our total sales represented by emerging markets.
Our global DES franchise sales in the first quarter were approximately $480 million.
In the U.S.
we look forward to launching our XIENCE 2.25 small vessel stent midyear this year.
We are currently not participating in the Small Vessel Market segment of the DES market.
And the launch of XIENCE 2.25 will allow us to drive additional XIENCE share.
And in addition in the U.S.
I'm also pleased to report today that we have submitted our next-generation XIENCE PRIME DES for U.S.
FDA approval.
Also in the first quarter we launched our new  TREK and MINI-TREK balloon catheters in both the U.S.
and Japan.
We expect these new products to drive share growth for Abbott in the Balloon segment of the market.
In our Vascular pipeline we have a number of new technologies in development.
Most recently at the American College of Cardiology or ACC conference in New Orleans we presented data on both our MitraClip and ABSORB devices.
MitraClip is under U.S.
FDA review for the treatment of significant mitral regurgitation which is a common and debilitating structural heart defect.
Today patients with significant MR are either treated with medication relieving symptoms but not stopping disease progression or undergo arrested open-heart surgery.
While surgery is a good option for many patients there is still a significant patient population considered at high risk for surgery.
Abbott's MitraClip is in development as another option to reduce mitral regurgitation.
At ACC we presented two-year data from our MitraClip pivotal trial EVEREST II.
MitraClip demonstrated superior safety to surgery and durable clinical benefits that are similar to surgery at two years.
We also continued to prepare for a FDA panel review for MitraClip midyear this year.
Also in ACC Abbott presented one-year clinical data for our ABSORB bioabsorbable vascular scaffold or BVS.
These data demonstrated low major adverse cardiac events low blood clots and low late loss.
ABSORB is the first BVS to treat coronary artery disease and is designed to slowly metabolize and eventually be absorbed by the body after providing support to the vessel during the healing process.
Data on our market-leading XIENCE V drug eluting stent were also presented at ACC which demonstrated predictably low stent thrombosis rates and consistently impressive efficacy at a pooled analysis of 7 000 patients many of whom had complex disease.
In fact XIENCE has now been studied in 30 000 patients in nearly 100 trials against six different stents and continues to perform exceptionally well.
So as we look ahead to the second quarter in our Global Vascular business we expect sales of approximately $830 million.
We're on track with our previous full year expectations and growth in the second half of the year is driven by continued international growth particularly in emerging markets as well as our XIENCE 2.25 launch in the U.S.
So with that I will turn the call over now to Larry and he'll give you a review of our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business.
Larry? Thanks John.
As a reminder we've recently globalized our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business creating one division to allow for streamlined commercial efforts and coordination between functions.
Worldwide sales in this division increased more than 11% driven by strong growth of nearly 13% in the U.S.
and more than 10% internationally.
Sales included the contribution from the Solvay acquisition which closed last February.
In Immunology global HUMIRA sales increased nearly 18%.
Performance is driven by international sales growth of nearly 19% and U.S.
sales growth of more than 16% consistent with the underlying trends we saw throughout the quarter.
Demand for HUMIRA continues to outpace the global market and new competitive entrants are tracking in line with our expectations for these products.
Internationally double-digit market growth continues in the major European countries where HUMIRA holds the number one share position.
And HUMIRA growth in the U.S.
continues to outpace the market.
We're continuing our development efforts for HUMIRA including the study of new indications and other product enhancements.
Our regulatory applications for ulcerative colitis are currently under review.
And we're evaluating other incremental indications currently in mid to late-stage development.
Additionally in the coming weeks we plan to submit regulatory applications for a new 29-gauge needle for the HUMIRA pen and syringe.
When approved the HUMIRA needle will be the thinnest in the category.
HUMIRA clinical data continue to compare favorably versus existing agents or potential new competitors.
Our growing body of indications and comprehensive label is among the most extensive in the class.
Recently we received approval in Europe to expand our product information for psoriasis making HUMIRA the only biologic in the EU with long term plaque psoriasis data out to three years included in its label.
Based on an outstanding clinical profile across our full range of indications and more than 13 years of clinical experience we are well positioned for continued success in this market.
HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year well on track to achieve our reported sales growth outlook for the product in 2011.
Moving on to our lipid franchise where sales of Niaspan were $226 million up more than 10% in the quarter.
Prescription growth significantly outpaced the growth of the overall lipid market.
Our focus on high-risk patients and the positive data showing Niaspan's benefit in this population continues to drive growth.
U.S.
sales of TriCor/TRILIPIX increased nearly 4%.
Global sales of AndroGel and Creon were $195 million and $133 million respectively in the quarter.
AndroGel holds the number one share position in the U.S.
testosterone replacement market an attractive category where growth is being driven by increasing diagnosis and treatment of low testosterone.
A new lower volume formulation of AndroGel is currently under U.S.
regulatory review and we expect approval during the second quarter.
When approved the new formulation will provide patients a more convenient application option delivering rapid and sustained improvements in testosterone levels with less gel than the existing formulation.
Creon also maintains a leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market.
And over the past year we've captured significant market share in the U.S.
We continue to garner the vast majority of new prescription starts in this category.
Moving on to Lupron and Synthroid.
U.S.
sales of Lupron in the quarter were up more than 10%.
We expect approximately $750 million in global Lupron sales in 2011.
And U.S.
sales of Synthroid remain strong at more than $115 million in the quarter.
We expect more than $450 million in U.S.
Synthroid sales in 2011.
Well as we look ahead to the second quarter in our Global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business we expect high-single digit reported sales growth including high-single digit growth in the U.S.
and high single to low-double digit growth internationally.
Moving on to our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals pipeline where we have a number of unique compounds in development in areas of significant medical opportunity.
Chronic kidney disease or the loss of kidney function is on the rise driven by higher rates of diabetes obesity and an aging population.
We're leveraging our decades of experience in renal disease to address this highly prevalent condition.
Current treatments only modestly slow the progression of CKD and many patients ultimately progress to dialysis and end-stage disease.
Bardoxolone data strongly suggest it may slow disease progression and they actually help reverse the progression of the disease which no other treatment has demonstrated.
We expect to present additional data from the Phase IIb study including 52-week results at a medical meeting in the second quarter.
And we're on track to initiate the global Phase III clinical program with our partner company in the coming weeks.
Also in development for the treatment of kidney disease is atrasentan.
Phase II data were recently published in the Journal of American Society of Nephrology.
And we plan to initiate a Phase IIb study in patients with diabetic kidney disease in the second half of this year.
We've also made significant progress with our internal hepatitis C program.
The HCV treatment landscape is expected to change rapidly over the next several years and will evolve considerably even after the newest therapies come to market.
Over the past year our program has moved quickly and we believe we're in a position to become a significant player.
We recently presented Phase II results for our protease inhibitor which demonstrated that 92% of patients taking ABT-450 in combination with standard of care achieved complete early response after 12 weeks of treatment.
ABT-450 has a number of strong attributes including potentially best-in-class antiviral activity good tolerability and once daily dosing.
We also recently presented Phase II data on our two polymerase inhibitors showing both compounds were well tolerated and have antiviral activity significantly greater than standard of care alone.
We believe both compounds have the potential to be complementary assets in an HCV combination treatment regimen.
And we recently began a Phase II study of our NS5A inhibitor.
Our HCV program will continue to progress throughout the year as we have a number of combination trials underway including studies with and without interferon.
In Neuroscience we're developing compounds to address conditions such as Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's schizophrenia pain and MS.
The Phase III study of daclizumab our next-generation biologic being evaluated in MS is currently underway.
Abbott and our partner company expect to present data from the Phase II select study during the second half of this year.
We're also continuing the Phase III development of Duodopa for advanced Parkinson's disease.
Duodopa is already on the market in most European countries where adoption is continuing to grow.
In Immunology we're leveraging our experience with HUMIRA to identify novel approaches to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with autoimmune diseases.
We continue our work on new HUMIRA indications.
In addition to ulcerative colitis we have additional indications in Phase II or Phase III studies including uveitis.
Our pipeline also includes early development work in oral DMARD therapies and biologics.
And our proprietary technology brings the capability of uniting two antibodies in a single target.
We expect our first combination biologic to move into Phase I clinical trials by year end.
Endometriosis and fibroids are both associated with a multitude of symptoms including pain and infertility.
Our partnered compound elagolix has a unique profile that provides symptom reduction while avoiding the adverse effects sometimes associated with current treatments.
Planning for the Phase III clinical program for endometriosis is ongoing.
We also continue to make good progress on Oncology.
Our pipeline includes a number of new molecular entities for more than a dozen different cancer types.
Elotuzumab has demonstrated very good response rates in multiple myeloma the second most common blood cancer in the U.S.
We recently initiated the Phase III program with our partner company.
Our multi-targeted kinase inhibitor seeks to cut off the blood supply to a tumor to stop the progression of cancer.
A Phase III study of the compound in liver cancer is underway and it's also being evaluated in Phase II studies for additional cancer types.
And our PARP-inhibitor which may enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies is being studied in mid-stage trials for a variety of cancer types.
We've also continued to make good progress in our early stage pipeline advancing a number of compounds into human studies including an S1P1 oral compound with potential in RA and MS a novel EGFR compound for cancer and we expect to begin a Phase I study this month for our next-generation highly selective Bcl-2 compound.
So in summary this quarter Abbott delivered strong double-digit performance with ongoing EPS growth of more than 12% exceeding our previous outlook.
This was driven by double-digit sales growth in each of our three major business categories as well as 38% growth in emerging markets.
And we confirmed our ongoing EPS outlook for the full year reflecting double-digit growth over 2010 at the midpoint of the range.
And with that Tom John and I will be glad to take your questions.
Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Tom I was hoping we could start with a strategic question.
And I think on the fourth quarter call probably it's the fourth quarter call but it's probably some discussion about Miles' answer to the question about any strategic options producing different assets within the business.
And I was wondering if we could get your perspective on the current portfolio at Abbott.
There's obviously been a lot of evolution of Abbott's portfolio over the last 10-plus years.
And we wanted to get the current mix of assets and the management and board's willingness to rethink some of those assets in order to create shareholder value? Mike this is Tom.
I think this quarter is a good demonstration of I believe the quality of all our businesses.
We really -- as you go down every one and you look at the revenue performance and what it translated to in overall EPS growth of over 12% I think you can see that the portfolio is a good one.
It's performing well and it's very complementary to our overall financial objectives.
We did talk a little bit about this on the fourth quarter.
And as we look at these businesses and again looking at the performance you see we're very happy with the outlook and potential for these businesses to contribute to our objectives longer term.
That said we have high expectations.
We have high standards for all the businesses.
We're performing against them now we believe.
But as our history has shown we are willing to take actions as appropriate to enhance shareholder value to put these businesses in a place where they're going to operate and flourish.
But right now I'd say that the portfolio is very strong.
You guys got the math that suggested organic growth was just over 6% this quarter I think our numbers were close to that maybe a tad lower.
Your guidance for the year Tom what does that imply for organic growth over the balance of 2011? Similar to what we said on the fourth quarter call.
We had high-single digit overall sales growth forecasted at that point in time.
We had around 3% impact of acquisitions so north of 6% organic growth and we delivered that.
Actually we did deliver over that at this quarter.
And we would expect a pretty consistent performance against that throughout the year.
And then last question and then I'll let some others jump in here.
But you gave a good overview I think Larry did there on some of the Pharmaceutical pipeline products.
Can you just give us your estimation of where you are in competitiveness with your Hep C platform? You moved I know the combination product into a clinical trial recently and obviously that space has gotten more crowded.
There's been a significant advancements in just the last few months.
Could you spend another minute on your program? Yes this is Larry.
We certainly do believe that we've made some very nice progress here very quickly and believe that we have a strong combination program under development here with multiple mechanisms of action.
And as I said in my remarks we're certainly looking at those in interferon-free ways as well with the combination of polymerase protease NS5A.
We'll see where we go.
We're also trying to take a look at shortening up duration of therapy course of therapy et cetera.
And again feel like we've made some great steps here recently.
Certainly there's going to be some products launched here near term.
But as we look at what they represent to the treatment community we certainly don't believe that the uptake of those is going to rapidly de-warehouse the HCV space.
And I think the treating clinicians have a very good understanding of what's in the pipeline including ours that could provide some significant benefit to patients down the road.
So as we look at it I think these new agents are going to get some of the HCV patients who are pretty far along in the course of their disease.
But I do believe that the physicians will be waiting for these other follow-on therapies including the combination treatment.
So we feel great about where we're at right now.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Larry HUMIRA is off to give a better start this year than obviously we expected.
And it sounds like a lot of that strength is coming from emerging markets but there was some competitor disruption.
And I think it's probably too early in the year to sort of change your outlook for HUMIRA.
But can you just sort of talk about the underlying factors? And how sustainable you think those are throughout the balance of the year? You mentioned the ex-US piece.
And certainly the markets as I've said in my remarks continue to grow strong double digits.
So the International business is off to a great start.
I think what probably is working even better than we thought initially this year is the U.S.
market.
We've seen scripts now growing and kind of the high-single digits approaching 10% for us.
Our team has done some very nice things early in the year from a competitive positioning and some real proactive work that they did to mitigate a little bit of that January effect that we've seen in the past.
So they've done a great job there and we've seen great growth in the U.S.
And as we look at the rest of the year maybe we've seen a little bit of economic benefit there too as the economy is stabilizing maybe move forward a little bit for us.
But we would expect these trends to continue and like I said we're well on track with HUMIRA to achieve our outlook for 2011.
And just maybe two more quick questions.
I  guess Larry just thinking about competitive data that have sort of come out and kind of pre-ular [ph] here looking at different dosing for the JAK inhibitor class.
We obviously saw in the lower dose one of your competitors not showing significant radiographic change.
I guess as you think about the outlook of sustainability of HUMIRA how should we kind of think about that data in terms of resilience of the franchise? Well clearly radiographic progression is very important not only to the patient but also to the treating physician.
And you mentioned the 5-milligram dose failing that primary end point.
That's very important if you look at the HUMIRA data.
That was a six-month readout.
If you look at HUMIRA at six months or 24 weeks we did show statistically significant radiographic inhibition at 52 weeks and we've maintained that kind of benefit out to 8 years now in our data sets.
So I think at the end of the day for the rheumatologist that is paramount to their view of products.
And we'll have to see where they go from here.
But for us that data is very strong in our label and something that we discuss with physicians all the time.
And just maybe one last question I'll jump back in queue.
I think post the American College meeting a lot of investors are trying to figure out what are the implications for competitive stent launches in the U.S.
marketplace? Maybe just talk a little about what you're seeing in terms of European trends with XIENCE and PRIME versus Element in the European market? And what we should expect as you see those products come to the U.S.
market? Yes.
So David this is John.
We've -- as I mentioned in my remarks our data at ACC was supplemental to the data we've shown on XIENCE in the past good strong data on both the base platform and also absorb.
But we look at the rest of the world we probably -- there's probably a lack of attention paid to the ex-U.S.
markets versus the U.S.
and the visibility there for us is good where about 2/3 of that overall worldwide market is outside the U.S.
And we've done quite well there.
XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME account for more than 30% of share in Europe.
And that's the leadership position.
And at the same time we've seen that the competitor product you mentioned has actually lost considerable amount of share while we've gained share in Europe on that.
And of course we've done extremely well in Japan where we have approximately 50% share.
And the market has been quite receptive.
And then of course there's emerging markets like China that we mentioned in our remarks as well.
So it's a strong market.
We're very pleased with performance there.
As I mentioned in the comments as well we have now announced that we have filed PRIME in the U.S.
so we're very comfortable with our time line there of getting into the U.S.
market by mid-2012 or sooner.
And then we have the other products you mentioned too that will help us in those areas where we don't have a position to date like the small vessels and of course PRIME with the long lesions.
So that's the stent piece of it and of course there's other components of it like TREK and then down the road MitraClip.
So I feel pretty good about where we're at.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC</strong> Two questions.
One you had a very good vascular quarter on top of our expectations top Street expectations.
Your guidance for 2Q if I heard it correctly was for $830 million which is below 1Q levels.
I'm wondering is that conservative? Is that trying to factor in Japan? And then my second question has to do with Japan just overall for the organization is there much of an impact? And then I'll follow-up with other question.
Thanks.
While there's a couple of dynamics at play there probably in the mix is lower PROMUS sales some overall lower U.S.
DES sales as we're holding share.
But as you know the market has taken some price and we're seeing that as well.
When we do launch the 225 NANO in the second half of the year we think that will help offset.
Of course in that business and Tom can talk to this more than I can is the bottom line impact of improvements in margin profile for that business which is key to the overall profitability story.
So net-net for the full year we feel pretty good overall.
And it gets back to what I just mentioned in terms of 2/3 of the market being outside the U.S.
where we are seeing strong performance of XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME.
Glenn I'll take the question on Japan.
First of all clearly our thoughts are with the people there as they begin to recover from this tragedy.
Our situation is all of our employees are safe.
We've been aiding as much as we can to help there.
Our -- the Abbott fund contributed $3 million right up front to the relief effort.
So we're doing everything we can to help.
We've looked at the business impact of this and there will be some economic disruption across the businesses.
But we factored that into our forecast and it's not material really for our outlook.
LLC</strong> Let me tell you this one quick follow-up.
At the end of this month you're going to stop supplying J&amp;J with rapid-exchange catheters for the Cypher system.
Do you know how much supply they have of your rapid-exchange catheters? I'm just trying to figure out how the market changes over the next couple of quarters if Cypher is no longer available on a rapid-exchange catheter? Yes I wouldn't be able to comment on J&amp;J's position.
You might be better served asking to them.
You're correct that that agreement has come to a conclusion and that's about all we can really say.
And I can't comment on their business.
Our next question is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.
Let me turn to the pharma pipeline.
Larry very carefully in your press release highlights the many projects underway.
You have a couple in Phase III daclizumab and elotuzumab in neuro-oncology.
Maybe -- it'd be really helpful if from your perspective Tom you could tell us whether it's these two Phase IIIs or some of the Phase IIs -- which should we be focused on as the most important perhaps one or two incremental growth drivers and over the next one two three four years whatever the right time frame should be? Well Rick we have a number -- we have pretty much the product Larry went through are our later-phase programs.
The HCV space is moving rapidly.
That is certainly one that you should watch.
The developments happened there with quite rapid change.
Daclizumab is a program in Phase III.
That's one that we're very very excited about given the hopefully very positive safety and efficacy profile of the product.
Elotuzumab again in Phase III and our partner company is also extremely excited about the prospects for that product.
So I think those are...
Bardoxolone...
Yes and then I guess the other big one is bardoxolone.
Those are the four that are in the later stages that in the time frame you mentioned are going to start contributing nicely to our growth.
And really everything we've seen from a clinical perspective and all those that are progressing according to plan I guess I'd have to throw one more in there.
Elagolix is a program that will be moving into Phase III we believe in the not-too-distant future.
And it's another later-stage program.
So it's hard to discern because they're all in similar phase of development and we'll be hitting in similar time frames.
So all five of those are our products to launch.
So there's no one that stands out then you're saying? I mean they're all -- every one of these licensing opportunities we've looked at are significant potential contributors if the clinical profile turns out to be what we suspect and hoped when we entered the deals.
And they're all on track with our expectations.
And often -- in many cases a year into our working with the companies and our experience with the programs.
Turning back to gross margin Tom.
You highlighted some of the pressures that dragged your gross margin about healthcare reform rebates and the EU pricing and FX.
And that we're -- it seems like you think we're going to see 100 basis points or so improvement sequentially in the second quarter.
Can you just help me understand -- so all the drags basically go away and so the natural benefits of mix kick in? First of all things like U.S.
Healthcare Reform European pricing those types of things that are truly significant headwinds this year we laid that all out on our fourth quarter call.
And that was all in our planning and expectations.
And despite some very good underlying trends in product mix and cost-production efforts in the businesses even in the fourth quarter as we were forecasting 2011 we believe we'd see modest gross margin improvement but kind of a transitional year while we got those kind of onetime pricing impacts behind us.
Our first quarter typically just from a product mix point of view is a little softer than other quarters.
That's part of -- as the mix improved going into the second quarter and the rest of the year that's going to be the big driver.
The one thing that has changed since we talked last January is just a very rapid weakening of the dollar.
And again in our company there's a lag between the sales benefit of a weaker dollar and the margin benefits which are going to come later in the year.
So that is really the one thing that's changed.
And you're right going forward it's better product mix growth of the higher margin products that's going to continue to boost that gross margin as we move into the second quarter.
And you're still on track for the di-move [ph] accretion from Solvay this year and $0.12 next year? That's still the right numbers? Well we're very much on track and we're probably doing somewhat better than that.
Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Tom question just sort of a follow-up from one of the earlier strategic questions.
I'm just trying to understand why you've gone to the great lengths to recharacterize your major businesses apart from providing greater transparency into Established Pharmaceuticals i.e.
emerging markets? I'm just wondering what it says about the strategic importance of these three business units? And I do think it's interesting...
That's a good question.
Can I -- yes I think it's interesting that you're reporting prescription or rather emerging -- or what do you call it? Emerging pharmaceuticals as part of Durable businesses not Prescription Pharmaceuticals.
And I'm just going to throw this out there but I'm just wondering if you're preparing investors for an eventual sort of spin or shakeup or whatever you might call it of one of those three businesses? And it's the business that is now smaller but I would think would be a major candidate.
But maybe if you could talk to that that would be great? And then just a follow-up a nitty-gritty one.
On SG&amp;A your guidance going into the year was a little above 27% of sales.
Should we now assume that's more like 28% just because of where currencies are falling? No let's take the SG&amp;A comment first.
Our forecast for full year SG&amp;A is exactly on what we said in the fourth quarter.
It's around 27% or maybe a little bit more than 27% of sales so no change in that.
The reason we've started to categorize our businesses in this way is really to help investors better understand the product mix in the business.
We truly believe that the Established Pharmaceuticals business which is primarily branded generic and emerging market has a different set of attributes than traditional patented pharmaceutical product.
We think that investors particularly those who are new to the story that haven't been following us as long as people like yourself Jaime don't have quite the appreciation of the mix of the businesses.
There's a perception that we are primarily a patented pharmaceutical company.
And when you we look at these sales breakdowns as we've presented we are 40% Durable growth which include that Established Pharma but it also includes Nutritional Diagnostics other very durable businesses with good growth opportunity.
We're about 40% Patented Pharma which I think is the number that surprises some people that really have not studied the company as carefully as others.
And then we're about 15% Innovation-Driven Devices.
And we just want to be sure that the underlying attributes and nature of these businesses and particularly the durability of this Durable Growth segment from a cash generation point of view the lack of exposure to the riskier patent cycles and R&amp;D cycles that you see in for example the Patented Pharma business that really is understood.
And this is a more predictable type of grouping of businesses that I think speaks to the investment character of the company.
So that's really what we're trying to do and we're going to continue to try to demonstrate the business this way.
And hopefully that will have some ultimate improved appreciation or perhaps valuation of the underlying businesses.
Just Tom if I could follow-up.
What will this mean with respect to your future capital allocation strategy? In other words are there it seems that if I were to ask you what is your core competency your core competency is it prescription drugs or is it Durable businesses? And just in terms of how you think about allocating capital i.e.
M&amp;A going forward how would you prioritize your three businesses? Well we have to be outstanding cost competitors in every single one of these businesses.
And we can't be -- we can't lack core competency on any one.
The only way our portfolio like this make sense which we believe ultimately drives a very good investment profile for investors is to be excellent in every single business.
And so I really can't answer that question.
Every single one of these businesses has to be competitive in terms of R&amp;D investment talent processes and all the other things that make a business successful.
So there is -- it doesn't say -- our capital is going to go to those opportunities that have the highest risk-adjusted opportunity.
And if all businesses have equal opportunity they're all going to get their fair share of capital.
If programs and investments come forward that have better risk-adjusted returns they're probably going to get a little more of the capital piece.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
One question around the Nutritionals business.
Given the disruption that occurred in manufacturing for powdered formula over a year ago the question becomes have margins in that business returned to normal? And are they potentially capable of improving? And then I have one follow-on.
Yes thanks Tony.
It is true that in 2010 the overall margins in our Nutritional business went down a couple three points from what they have been running at.
And that was largely due to the recall last fall.
The product that was recalled is a very important one for us.
I think the really good news is that that team is doing an outstanding job regaining share.
The numbers you see in terms of reported sales being only slightly down in the U.S.
Nutrition business I think reflect that execution.
And frankly they reflect above expectations performance in the other businesses beyond Nutrition which is where the recall occurred.
So this year we expect some modest progress in at least as we looked at the original plan some modest improvement back in the Nutrition business margins as we went through the recovery process.
But if we do better as it looks like we may do in the U.S.
business which is an important piece of the product mix story there we could do better than our planning assumption.
And I know that that's what the team and our business is aiming to do.
But beyond that Tony even if we get back to where we were say in '09 in terms of margin in this business we're really not satisfied with that as we've looked at some competitor margins.
We definitely could do better and we've got a number of activities going on within that business really focused on margin improvement.
And we believe that in the years after 2011 that team will deliver a steadily improving and hopefully significantly improving margin in that Global Nutrition business.
So we've got some pretty big aspirations there.
And hopefully as we move forward we'll be able to show some even better results on margins in the Nutrition business.
Thank you Tom and one final question.
Where you laid out very nicely again some R&amp;D activities one around bardoxolone as that Phase III begins to ramp.
Is Abbott responsible for the entire cost of development for that Phase III program for its ex-U.S.
submission? Thanks.
No there's shared R&amp;D on that program.
Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
LLC</strong> What is your guidance assumed for generic Tricor in the U.S.? Is there a chance we could see generic before July 2012 given some of the movement on the generic side? No we don't believe so.
They're -- we're fairly confident that Tricor generic competitors will come in mid-2012 this year.
LLC</strong> And then on the Vascular side.
You're initiating a limited launch of BVS in Europe.
Have you made a pricing decision? Obviously that's something that could turn around the price erosion we've seen there.
And just lastly on MitraClip I don't know if you want to comment on the proposed reimbursement we saw last night.
If I was reading the document correctly it looked like it was being mapped to a relatively low-paying DRG? Thanks.
Hi Larry.
This is John.
Let me take your last question first.
The DRG I think has been out there for some time.
It's obviously not final and open for public commentary at this point.
As you know it's all part of the process.
We believe at Abbott that the appropriate DRG payments should be more in line with DRG rate for patients who are undergoing open-heart surgery.
But this is something that will be discussed and it's just one step in the overall reimbursement process for a new product like MitraClip and so we'll see how it goes and we're hopeful that it would be eventually coded that way.
As for ABSORB I think as we said in the past that we're not specifically discussing pricing for a product that's a couple of years away in the U.S.
But clearly with the benefits that we have shown with the product and if the clinical data continues to demonstrate the type of response that we see and then also giving patients the benefit of not having any material left in the vessel and the flexibility and natural healing elements and all the attributes this could be a game-changing technology.
And will likely warrant a premium price in the marketplace but that's -- a lot not yet to be determined there.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
Larry you touched on IMS growth for HUMIRA.
And I think over the last two quarters we've seen your TRX growth in the 8% to 9% range with reported rev growth of 13% last quarter 16% this quarter.
I was just wondering if you could comment on what kind of pricing you're seeing for HUMIRA right now and if that's improving? And if so how sustainable that might be? Well we do have the difference generally speaking between TRX -- obviously TRX growth is somewhat of a blunt instrument.
But we use it as an approximation I guess for script trends overall.
The difference between script trends and the ultimate reported percentage growth is likely price.
You're well aware of the history of the price increases here on HUMIRA over the last year.
There weren't any new HUMIRA increases in 2011.
But I would ascribe that differential between script trends and the reported growth in the U.S.
to realize the price.
I think that's fair.
Do you see that level of pricing that we've seen over the last two quarters as sustainable? Well it's been fairly consistent.
Year-over-year we've been in kind of a 10 to 12-month clock.
And it's been in that 4% to 5% range and we don't predict future price increases but you can see that as kind have been our history.
Great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our final question is from Robert Hopkins from Bank of America.
Just finish up here with a couple of in-the-weeds questions on Vascular.
Now that we're getting closer to the end of the agreement with Boston Scientific I was just curious if you guys could give any clarity on the contribution that you've been realizing from that royalty payment for those guys? Is that something you're going to disclose? No we haven't specifically broken out that particular payment but we're obviously eager to have XIENCE PRIME on the market and more than willing to compete head-to-head for that share where a lot of docs as you know are very comfortable with the platform as it exists today and would appreciate an improvement on that product.
So that's the way we're looking at a chance to get 100%.
Okay.
And then with ABSORB I know it's very early and it's a very limited situation in Europe.
But in the centers where it has been launched and in the addressable market is there any qualitative or quantitative commentary that you can give on the reception of that product in its limited form right now? Yes I think that a reception's been very good.
We've been pleased with the rate of uptake of centers across Europe.
Doctors seem to be pleased with the performance of the product.
As you know as we showed at ACC the one-year Cohort B data looked very good and confirmed the six and nine-month results that we've previously seen with no thrombosis and low MACE rates low weight loss et cetera returning the vessel to a more normal functioning.
So I think they're excited about it.
They're excited about the fact of leaving patients with a healed vessel and no metal implant.
So we still have a ways to go but so far so good.
And I think what we're seeing in Europe is reflective of the potential and future for the product worldwide and in the U.S.
So we're pleased.
I mean you're taking a lot of share on a couple of individual accounts in its addressable market or is it mostly just being trialed at this point? It's being trialed right now.
We do expect to be in about 80 centers worldwide by the end of this year.
And so it's nothing that we're specifically breaking out at this time Remember we don't have any revenues in our plan this year for the product.
And then 225 in the U.S.
would you say that -- what percentage of the market is 225 in the U.S.
today? 10% to 15% or is it less? Well I think it's a little less than that.
Maybe 5% to 10%.
And then finally for me just on the same topic or similar topic.
Stent pricing in the U.S.
before ABSORB comes is there any reason to believe that it would be anything different than the sort of negative 7% to 10% that we've been seeing.
Any reason to think that we might see an improvement in stent pricing going forward or not really? Well as you know there has been a sequential decline in pricing in the marketplace.
We still believe that XIENCE is a premium product overall.
And with XIENCE PRIME coming and some of the other products that we've mentioned we'll see how pricing goes.
We're not counting on a robust pricing environment in our outlook.
We'll model more conservatively but there are some new technologies in the pipeline for us and some others and  those should command a premium price in the market.
Thanks Bob.
That's going to conclude our call for today.

In today's conference call as we do always non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help our investors understand Abbott’s ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
I'd also like to call your attention to a supplemental slide deck that we'll be posting to our website after our call concludes today.
It includes highlights of Abbott's recent pipeline progress and a more detailed list of information on related market opportunities.
And while these slides are not intended to be a comprehensive overview of our broad-based pipeline our goal here is to provide investors with additional color on certain opportunities across our emerging portfolio.
And we plan to build on this supplemental information as we go forward in future quarters so consider this a starting point and we hope you find it useful.
With that I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom? Thanks John.
Today we're pleased to report strong second quarter results as we delivered ongoing earnings per share of $1.12 up 10.9% and at the high end of our previous guidance.
And we raised our full year EPS guidance range confirming our outlook for double-digit growth in 2011.
We're also pleased with the progress we've seen from our broad-based pipeline so far this year.
We've launched a number of new products or indications across the company advanced 2 promising compounds in the Phase III development submitted 3 significant new products or indications for regulatory review and added a mid-stage biologic for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis to the pipeline.
Sales growth in the quarter was 9% including a favorable 4.6% impact from exchange rates.
Growth in the quarter was led by a 13% increase in Proprietary Pharmaceuticals including strong global performance from HUMIRA which was up nearly 19% before exchange.
And our emerging market sales in the quarter were nearly $2.6 billion an increase of more than 23% underscoring the contribution of these markets to Abbott's overall growth profile.
Durable Growth business sales increased 7.5% driven by double-digit growth in international Nutritionals Point of Care Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals.
And Innovation-Driven Device business sales increased 3.1% including double-digit growth in Molecular Diagnostics.
Regarding other aspects of the P&amp;L in the quarter the adjusted gross margin ratio was 60.2% ahead of our previous forecast driven by improved product mix.
The ongoing tax rate at 15.2% was in line with our previous forecast for the quarter.
Turning to our outlook for 2011.
Today we're raising our ongoing earnings per share guidance for the full year to $4.58 to $4.68.
The midpoint of this guidance range continues to reflect double-digit ongoing EPS growth for 2011.
For the third quarter today we're issuing ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.16 to $1.18.
The midpoint of this EPS range represents more than 10% growth over the prior year.
We forecast specified items of $0.18 in the third quarter primarily reflecting integration costs from past acquisitions and costs of previous restructuring actions.
We're forecasting low double-digit sales growth in the third quarter including an estimated favorable impact from exchange of approximately 3.5%.
And we're forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 60%.
Also for the third quarter we're forecasting R&amp;D investment approaching 10% of sales and SG&amp;A of around 28% of sales.
Regarding our tax rate we're continuing to forecast a full year 2011 rate approaching 15% and the third quarter between 14.5% and 15%.
So in summary we're pleased with our performance through the first half of this year.
We've delivered on our commitments raised our guidance range and confirmed our strong outlook for 2011.
We've made steady progress in our broad-based pipeline with new approvals regulatory filings and late-stage trial initiations and we continue to see strong results from our strategic actions to expand our emerging markets presence across the businesses.
With that I'll turn it over to John and Larry for the business operating highlights.
John? Thanks Tom.
Today Larry and I will walk you through as we did last quarter our 3 business categories.
Let me start with our Durable Growth and Innovation-Driven Device businesses and then Larry will give you an overview of our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business as well as our pharmaceutical pipeline.
Sales growth will be discussed on a reported basis which includes the impact of foreign exchange.
Let me start with our Durable Growth businesses.
In Established Pharmaceuticals which includes international sales of our branded generics portfolio we reported global sales of more than $1.3 billion.
More than half of EPD sales are in emerging markets which this quarter were $775 million up 25%.
Our large portfolio of Established Pharmaceuticals consists of hundreds of branded generic products spanning primary care therapeutic categories.
The depth of our portfolio and the diversity of our geographic footprint help us drive durable sustainable performance.
We expect more than $5 billion in Established Pharmaceuticals sales in 2011.
In our worldwide Nutritional business global sales increased 5.4% this quarter driven by double-digit growth internationally.
In the United States as we've mentioned previously we planned for a difficult comparison in our U.S.
Nutritional business during the first half of this year as we work to recapture share in our infant formula business.
U.S.
Nutritional sales as a result were down 3.5% in the second quarter which was in line with our forecast slightly better.
We continue to hold the #1 infant formula share position in hospitals which drives consumption at the retail level.
And we are making good progress in our efforts to return our retail share to pre-call levels.
And we anticipate better sales growth for the U.S.
Nutrition business in the second half of the year.
PediaSure in the quarter grew strong double digits driven by continued success of our new SideKicks brand.
In our U.S.
Adult Nutrition business we saw continued momentum from the new line extensions of our Ensure brand.
Outside of the U.S.
Nutritional sales increased 14% this quarter.
Growth was driven by continued strong growth in emerging markets which comprised the majority of our international Nutrition sales.
This quarter our emerging markets sales for the Nutritions business were $630 million up 16%.
This was driven by strong performance in Asian and Latin American markets where we continue to launch new products increase penetration and capture market growth.
For the full year 2011 we're forecasting more than $2 billion in emerging market Nutritional sales which we expect to double over the next 5 years.
In China alone we expect nutrition sales to reach $1 billion by 2014.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in our global Nutritions business we expect worldwide sales to accelerate to double-digit growth with U.S.
sales up mid single digits and international sales up strong double digits.
In our global diabetes business this quarter worldwide sales increased 2.7%.
U.S.
sales increased more than 4% and international sales were up approximately 2%.
We received CE Mark in May for our new FreeStyle InsuLinx blood glucose monitor which includes a mealtime insulin calculator.
InsuLinx is designed to help provide suggested insulin dosing advice for patients with diabetes who require insulin to manage their condition.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in global diabetes we expect high single-digit revenue growth.
In our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business which includes immunoassay and hematology global sales increased 8%.
U.S.
sales increased 4.4% driven by strong growth of our ARCHITECT platform.
Outside of the U.S.
we saw strong growth in emerging markets up 9% in the quarter.
This was driven by double-digit growth in Asia including strong sales in China.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in our Core Laboratory Diagnostic business we expect high single-digit growth.
In our Point of Care Diagnostics business sales this quarter increased 17% driven by strong Troponin and the CHEM 8 test cartridge sales.
For the third quarter in Point of Care Diagnostics we expect another quarter of strong double-digit growth.
I'll now turn to our Innovation-Driven Device businesses.
Starting with Molecular Diagnostics where global sales in the quarter increased more than 18% driven by international sales growth of more than 30%.
During the quarter we placed our 1000th m2000 analyzer.
One of our core strategies in Molecular Diagnostics is to advance the field of companion diagnostics or personalized medicine.
On that front we developed a molecular test to pair with Pfizer's drug in development for non-small cell lung cancer.
We recently submitted this ALK [anaplastic lymphoma kinase] gene test for regulatory review in the U.S.
and Japan.
Also in the quarter we received FDA approval for a real-time PCR molecular test for measuring the viral load of hepatitis C completing our core menu on the m2000.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in Molecular Diagnostics we expect strong double-digit growth.
In our Vision Care business worldwide sales this quarter increased 7.5%.
Globally we continue to gain share in our cataract business with our TECNIS multifocal and monofocal IOLs.
We also continue to grow share in our corneal business with our new RevitaLens contact lens solution which is doing quite well and has gained approximately 6% share points since the beginning of the year.
As we look ahead to the third quarter in our Vision Care business we expect high single-digit sales growth.
In our Vascular business worldwide sales in the second quarter were $835 million slightly ahead of the expectations and outlook we provided last quarter.
In our international Vascular sales which is more than half of our total Vascular sales business we saw 25% growth in emerging markets.
International markets comprised 2/3 of the global drug eluting stent market.
And in emerging markets procedure volume is growing on average at a mid-teens rate.
Abbott is particularly well positioned internationally and we've seen impressive performance with both XIENCE and our next-generation XIENCE PRIME drug eluting stent.
Our global DES franchise sales which include XIENCE sales as well as third-party DES revenues were approximately $485 million in the second quarter.
Global XIENCE sales increased both sequentially and year-over-year.
This was offset in the quarter by a double digit decline in third-party DES revenues.
XIENCE remains the #1 drug eluting stent globally with worldwide market share of approximately 35%.
In the quarter we continued to advance our leadership position with the U.S.
launch of XIENCE NANO our stent for small vessels.
The small vessels segment of the market represents approximately 10% of all the vessels that are treated so this is a new market segment where we can now compete with XIENCE NANO.
We expect this new product will help us continue to gain XIENCE share over the next several months.
Our endovascular and other coronary businesses which comprise approximately 40% of our vascular sales also performed well in the quarter.
We've had multiple new product launches in numerous new geographies over the past year which has helped drive good momentum through the first half.
The first quarter launch of our new TREK balloon catheters in the U.S.
and Japan following a successful launch in Europe last year drove double-digit sales growth of our balloon segment in the quarter.
Solid endovascular sales also positively impacted the second quarter led by sales in vessel closure and our Armada 14 balloon line.
An expanded indication for our RX ACCULINK carotid stent also contributed to positive momentum.
In our Vascular pipeline XIENCE PRIME our next-generation drug eluting stent continues to perform well internationally as we expand our global DES leadership position.
PRIME provides physicians with enhanced deliverability on a best-in-class DES platform.
We now expect approval and launch of PRIME in the United States in the first half of 2012.
MitraClip is our minimally invasive device approved in Europe Australia Singapore and other countries for the treatment of select patients with mitral regurgitation.
In the U.S.
it's currently under FDA review.
As part of our ongoing dialogue with the agency we're providing them additional information and analysis.
Subsequent to this review we'll be in a better position to estimate timing.
Also in our Vascular pipeline is our ABSORB bioresorbable vascular scaffold.
It's designed to slowly metabolize and eventually be absorbed by the body after providing support to the vessel during the healing process leaving no permanent metallic implant behind.
It received CE Mark in January and a full-scale launch in Europe is planned by the end of 2012.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in our global Vascular business we now expect mid-single-digit sales growth.
So with that I'll turn the call over at this time to Larry for a review of our Proprietary Pharmaceutical business and a few pipeline highlights as well.
Larry? Thanks John.
As a reminder earlier this year we globalized our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business creating one division to allow for streamlined commercial efforts and coordination between functions.
Worldwide Proprietary Pharmaceutical sales increased 13% in the quarter driven by growth of 9% in the U.S.
and 19% internationally.
In immunology global HUMIRA sales increased more than 18% before the favorable impact of exchange.
Performance was driven by international sales growth of 19% before exchange and U.S.
sales growth of more than 18% consistent with the underlying trends we saw throughout the quarter.
Demand for HUMIRA continues to outpace the global market and new competitive entrants are tracking in line with our expectations for these products.
Internationally double-digit market growth continues in the major European countries where HUMIRA holds the #1 share position.
And HUMIRA growth in the U.S.
continues to outpace the market.
We're continuing our development efforts for HUMIRA including the study of new indications and product enhancements.
Our regulatory applications for ulcerative colitis are currently under review and we're evaluating other indications currently in mid- to late-stage development.
We also continued to introduce new indications in geographies around the world.
We recently received approval for our fifth indication in Japan for HUMIRA juvenile idiopathic arthritis or JIA.
With an outstanding clinical profile across our full range of indications and more than 14 years of clinical experience we continue to be well positioned for success in this market.
HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year.
And based on this performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year we are raising our forecast.
We expect high teens reported global sales growth for HUMIRA in 2011 up from our original expectations of low teens growth.
Moving on to our lipid franchise where sales of Niaspan were $247 million.
While it is still early we've seen a modest impact to prescription trends beginning late in the quarter following the discontinuation of the AIM-HIGH trial in late May.
Physician feedback from experienced Niaspan users and key opinion leaders continues to be favorable regarding the value of Niaspan and treating HDL.
U.S.
sales of TRILIPIX/TriCor increased more than 3%.
Global sales of AndroGel and CREON were $227 million and $149 million respectively.
During the quarter Abbott received FDA approval for AndroGel 1.62%.
The new low-volume formulation provides patients with a more convenient application process delivering rapid and sustained improvements in testosterone levels with less gel than the previous formulation.
CREON maintains a leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market.
And over the past year we've captured significant market share in the U.S.
We continue to garner the vast majority of new prescription starts in this category.
Last month we received FDA approval for an infant-specific dose of CREON.
This new dose provides the lowest approved dosage strength in the class and enables more precise titration.
Moving on to 2 consistent performers within our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals portfolio Synthroid and Lupron.
U.S.
sales of Lupron were up 12%.
Last month Abbott announced FDA approval for a new 6-month formulation of Lupron Depot expanding dosing options.
We expect more than $750 million in total global Lupron sales in 2011.
And U.S.
sales of Synthroid remained strong at $140 million.
We expect more than $450 million in total U.S.
Synthroid sales this year.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in our global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business we expect high single-digit sales growth including mid single-digit growth in the U.S.
and another quarter of strong double-digit growth internationally.
Moving on to our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals pipeline where as Tom mentioned we continue to make good progress.
We currently have more than 20 new compounds or indications in Phase II or III development across oncology immunology HCV neuroscience and pain management and other areas of significant medical need.
Let's start with chronic kidney disease or the loss of kidney function which is on the rise driven by higher rates of diabetes obesity and an aging population.
We're leveraging our decades of expertise in renal disease to address this highly prevalent condition.
Last month Phase II bardoxolone data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at a European renal meeting.
These data showed that bardoxolone produced sustained improvements in kidney function over 52 weeks in patients with moderate to severe CKD and Type 2 diabetes.
And last month we initiated the global Phase III clinical program for bardoxolone with our partner company.
Results from this 1 600-patient study are expected in 2013 with potential commercialization in the 2014 timeframe.
We also continue to make significant progress with our internal hepatitis C program.
The HCV treatment landscape is expected to continue to evolve considerably over the next several years and we believe we're in a position to become a significant player.
We have 3 mechanisms of action in Phase II development including protease polymerase and NS5A inhibitors.
Over the past year our HCV program has moved quickly and will continue to progress throughout the year as we have a number of combination trials underway including studies with and without interferon.
In neuroscience we're developing compounds to address conditions such as Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's schizophrenia pain and MS.
A Phase III study of daclizumab a next-generation biologic being evaluated in MS is currently underway.
Abbott and our partner company expect to present Phase II data for daclizumab at a European clinical meeting in October.
We are also continuing development of an intestinal gel known as Duodopa internationally for advanced Parkinson's disease.
It's currently in Phase III development in the U.S.
and is already on the market in most European countries where adoption of this novel system is continuing to grow.
We recently presented interim data from a Phase III open label study of Duodopa showing patients reported an increase in the amount of time where disease symptoms were well managed.
In immunology we're leveraging our experience with HUMIRA to identify novel approaches to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with autoimmune diseases.
We continue our work on HUMIRA and plan to introduce a cadence of new indications over the next several years.
Beyond ulcerative colitis we have 2 additional indications in Phase II or III studies including uveitis and a chronic skin disease that most commonly affects the sweat glands.
All told we expect new indications to drive more than $1 billion in incremental peak-year sales.
Our pipeline also includes early development work in oral DMARD therapies and biologics.
And our proprietary DVD-Ig technology brings the capability of uniting 2 antibodies in a single agent.
We expect our first combination biologic to move into Phase I clinical trials by year end.
Last month Abbott entered into an agreement with Biotest to develop and commercialize a novel anti-CD4 biologic which is currently in Phase II clinical trials for RA and psoriasis.
Our goal with this agreement and all of our R&amp;D and licensing efforts in immunology is to raise the bar with differentiated efficacy.
Endometriosis and fibroids are both associated with a multitude of symptoms including pain and infertility.
Our partnered compound elagolix has a unique profile that provides symptom reduction while avoiding significant bone loss or other adverse effects that can sometimes be associated with current treatments.
We're working with regulators to finalize the Phase III clinical program for endometriosis and a Phase II clinical program for fibroids with a target of trial initiation near year end.
We also continue to make good progress in oncology.
Our pipeline includes 11 new molecular entities for more than a dozen different cancer types.
Elotuzumab has demonstrated very good response rates in multiple myeloma the second most common blood cancer in the U.S.
We recently began the Phase III program for elotuzumab with our partner company.
Our multi-targeted kinase inhibitor seeks to cut off the blood supply to a tumor to stop the progression of cancer.
A Phase III study of this compound in liver cancer is under way.
And our PARP-inhibitor which may enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies is being studied in mid-stage trials for a variety of cancer types.
So in summary this quarter Abbott delivered strong double-digit performance with ongoing EPS growth of 11% at the high end of our previous guidance range.
And we raised our ongoing EPS outlook for the full year reflecting double-digit growth over 2010 at the midpoint of the range.
So with that Tom John and I will be glad to take your questions.
Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Maybe just a couple of items just to clarify.
One you had a very good quarter for HUMIRA and you raised your HUMIRA guidance for the year.
So if you could provide any color on what you think is going on in the underlying markets both in the U.S.
and o U.S.
that would be appreciated.
And then second one item we're struggling a bit with it is that if we look at the international pharmaceutical performance HUMIRA as we noted was very strong but it looks like there's a pretty meaningful drop-off in sales of other products once you kind of back out HUMIRA and then submit a product that you list in the press release.
So if you can give any color there as to what's going on.
Are those old Solvay products that are dropping off? Any insights would be appreciated.
Yes this is Tom.
For HUMIRA we're seeing really globally good market performance to start with.
In the U.S.
in particular growth rates have picked up this year and that is certainly bolstering the product.
And in international as you know growth rates have been quite a bit stronger than the U.S.
and they've continued to be in mid-teens or even better growth rates.
So certainly that is helping support the product.
We're also executing quite well in the businesses in terms of share performance most significantly in the derm and the gastro areas.
But also we're seeing some progress in RA as well despite the fact that there's some -- a fair amount of competition in that space.
So globally we're just seeing good market growth good share performance and very good execution on the part of our business people.
And Mike on the question on pharma growth I think if you look at most of the products we're seeing pretty strong growth across them in the quarter.
So maybe you could be a little bit more specific about exactly what your question is on the pharma growth.
This is Larry.
[indiscernible] quarter so did HUMIRA obviously.
There's not that many products actually in the proprietary business any longer.
Again a lot of the Solvay products other than say a Duodopa have moved over into the Established Pharma business.
So most of the other products as Tom said had pretty good quarters.
Well if you look at -- I'm sorry but just to dive in here but if you looked at international pharma and you backed out HUMIRA and you backed out Kaletra and let's say Lupron just for kicks as well you would get that -- the balance of that international pharma piece is down about $250 million year-over-year.
So about a $600 million business last year is now about a $350 million business once you strip out the stuff that you guys report.
So I was just hoping to get some color on the products that are going away.
Is that old Solvay business that you guys have decided to stop marketing? Because that is pulling down your international pharma growth by a fair amount.
Certainly within Established Pharmaceuticals there are a handful of products that are at the end of their life Lanzaprazole for example in a couple of markets has gone off-patent.
In terms of Abbott those are relatively minor.
There has been a little bit of Solvay-related turbulence shall we say as we work through the products that are remaining in the portfolio compared to those that are going to be -- we're no longer going to be promoting.
But I would only -- it's very selective relatively minor and really I'd say anything that is -- that you're talking about is really being worked through in the first half here and is not representative of what we expect in terms of growth rates for these businesses going into the third and fourth quarters.
So there was a little bit of that Mike but really not significant to our performance in the quarter.
Okay.
And then on the emerging market numbers you guys are now providing.
So you reported 23% emerging markets sales growth.
Tom do you have any kind of estimate on what that would be if we looked at it on an organic basis? So if we try to adjust for currency for the timing of the Piramal deal? In terms of M&amp;A the only impact in there is Piramal.
As you know we've fully lapped Solvay so that does not have an impact.
And you have a pretty good idea what our annual sales for Piramal are.
Exchange generally speaking is lower in the emerging markets than it is for the overall company.
Obviously the positive currency in the quarter was mainly due to yen and euro.
So I don't have a precise number for you but I think you can factor in less exchange in those businesses than what you're seeing broadly across Abbott and just adjust for the quarter of Piramal that we didn't have in the 2010 base.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Just a quick question on stent dynamics.
Obviously this particular quarter you're facing a very very challenging comp.
But considering competitor issues I wonder if you could update us about what expectations you have for sort of the next 3 to 4 quarters in the stent market specifically on opportunities for share and then secondarily price stabilization potentially? Yes.
Well as I mentioned in my call remarks we've done quite well internationally with XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME launching and we're continuing to gain incremental share there as well.
And we're optimistic with the launch of XIENCE PRIME and approval coming here in the first half of 2012.
DES pricing has been stable I would say down low single digits sequentially and upper single digits year-over-year as expected.
It's been a little bit better so I'd say overall we feel pretty good about that market in terms of its moderation in price.
And with one of the main competitors leaving the market that obviously opens up an opportunity.
That's about $400 million particularly in the small vessel stent area with our recent launch of NANO so we expect to gain some of that share and take some of that market as well.
I think the thing that people forget about is international sales and markets for our overall DES portfolio make up more than 60% of our total global sales now.
So we continue to see better growth in emerging markets and PCI volume obviously in those markets is growing mid-teens versus flattish here in the U.S.
Tom just thinking about margins in the quarter Miles made a comment earlier on in the year that I interpreted as his comfort or visibility on double-digit earnings growth for 2012 and then I think about your progress through the first half of this year.
I wonder if you'd be able to sort of update us on your visibility on double-digit earnings growth for 2012 based on the performance in the first half.
Well it's clearly too early to talk about 2012 today.
I mean we've had a great quarter a great first half of the year.
And obviously we're feeling good about the business as we've increased our guidance range for the year.
So the momentum is good.
Obviously HUMIRA I think is outperforming most expectations this year.
We're seeing really nice momentum in that product.
Our x U.S.
Nutrition I think you're going to see accelerated growth in the second half so that bodes well going forward.
Same thing in our Established Pharmaceuticals you're going to see stronger growth in the second half as we work through some of these kind of transitional issues.
So I think the momentum is good.
I think we've got a lot of growth drivers.
We've talked a lot about operating margin opportunities which have been dampened down a little bit this year by some of the headwinds we talked about earlier in the year that we're overcoming quite nicely with our performance.
And so while operating margins this year are only expected to improve modestly we think there's still -- there's going to be much more opportunity going forward there.
So I think we've got a lot of things going our way to have another strong year in 2012 but it's a little too early to start forecasting till we get deeper into this year and get through our budgeting processes.
And Tom just maybe a quick follow up on your comment on Nutritionals.
As that business recovers is it possible for Abbott to expand the nutritionals market through M&amp;A either in the U.S.
or o U.S.
or do you think existing market share becomes an impediment to that? I don't think we need to do things like that.
We've done a really nice job the last 4 or 5 years in terms of organic growth and investments of commercial resources and infrastructure in these various markets as we've grown them so strongly.
So we have great brands.
We play both obviously in the infant side and in the medical side.
A lot of the competition doesn't have that both sides of the business and the strong performance.
This business is very committed to innovation.
And if you look at whether its formulations or packaging we've done a very nice job in terms of enhancing our market position through our R&amp;D efforts.
So the answer is we don't need to do any M&amp;A activity to be successful there.
But we like the business it's a core part of the company very important to us and we're always looking for any opportunity to grow the business.
Our next question is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.
Can you discuss just generally the -- pharma had obviously a solid quarter.
Can you talk about the impact of pricing or inventory stocking de-stocking in the quarter? How that helped or dragged or anything there? We had very very stable inventories at very very comfortable levels for us throughout the quarter so there was really no impact of inventories in the quarter.
And pricing? Yes there was some price obviously going positive in the quarter.
Okay.
Gross margins Tom obviously were very solid and you're giving us good guidance again for the third quarter.
Can you give a little more color on what's driving that? And it's been a long time coming you sort of getting to that 60% mark.
Are we sustainably going to be at 60% going forward as best you can judge today? Well that is my forecast.
But we talked a lot about this this year in particular and it's a bit frustrating because we're executing extremely well in terms of efficiencies and product mix.
Exchange has been a bit of a headwind this year.
It probably took more than 2 points out of our year-over-year comparison in the quarter.
So we were over 60% despite that.
But the mix is improving and that's what helped us get to the 60% level this year.
I think we're going to work through the impact of European austerity and some of these things we talked about earlier in the year by the end of 2011.
So once we're through some of those onetime transitional issues certainly our expectation is to stay sustainably above 60% and expand it.
And that's part of our growth story as we move into 2012 and beyond.
So product mix is really helping.
I think some of the things going on this year are masking real progress.
And we've made good progress.
And not as much as we might have but I think you're going to see more of that as we go into next year.
That's very helpful.
Just one last quick one maybe for John.
John you talked about MitraClip briefly U.S.
under review.
Any sense of timing? And remind me where we are internationally.
And am I misremembering that maybe there were some manufacturing issues? Are they resolved? Just where do things stand? Right.
We can't be specific on timing.
We're still optimistic about a panel.
It's less likely that panel's going to occur in 2011 but it's as you know up to the agency.
So we'll be talking with them on that going forward and we've provided additional information that they're looking for.
So we'll update you on that as soon as we know something.
Internationally we did have a recall of MitraClip.
It was based on the tip of the catheter.
We've resolved that and we expect to have that back on the market here in the third quarter.
Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC</strong> Two questions.
First on Niaspan the script data has trended down since we've seen the AIM-HIGH study.
And you had a good quarter with Niaspan and my guess is it's because of pricing.
So I'm wondering is 2Q -- do you think 2Q is the peak of this product? Should we model down sales going forward? So just your thoughts on Niaspan going forward.
And then I had a follow-up question for Tom.
Sure.
This is Larry.
Certainly we've been watching the scripts and everybody has seen what they've done 6 weeks after AIM-HIGH relative to 6 weeks before we'd say that they're down about 5%.
So a pretty modest impact at this point.
But we certainly continue to watch those.
We believe that we've incorporated a reasonable estimate here for the second half for Niaspan and our outlook for 2011.
And to your point price will still play a bit of a positive role here in the second half.
But still 6 weeks out.
It's a little bit early to make an official call on it.
We continue to watch it.
But at this juncture down 5% 6 weeks before and compared to 6 weeks after is again a fairly modest decline at this point.
But we feel like we've got a pretty reasonable expectation for the second half.
LLC</strong> And so should we assume sales decline here from the 2Q level? Is that fair assumption? I don't know if I could specifically guide you to that at this point.
Again price will play a little bit of a role.
We'll see how it plays out.
Again scripts are down about 5%.
Yes.
I think at this point we expect positive growth out of Niaspan in the third quarter.
LLC</strong> Okay great.
And then Tom on the tax rate.
Third quarter you're saying that the tax rate's going to be a little bit lower than the full year.
Full year around 15% but 3Q in the 14.5% to 15%.
So what's bringing down the tax rate a little bit lower in the third quarter? You remember on the first quarter call when we talked about Puerto Rico which there's this excise tax for our operations there.
We're incurring expense up in the cost of sales line which is another item that's holding back our progress in gross margin transitionally this year.
But anyway so we have the gross expense up there but we have the creditability reflected in the tax line.
That's the way we have to do it.
And so for the full year in the first quarter we had brought down the full year tax rate to reflect that credit.
And what you're seeing is just the progression of these changes through the P&amp;L over the quarter.
So again for the full year consistent with what we said on the first quarter approaching 15% tax rate average for the full year and you cited our guidance for the fourth quarter -- or for the third quarter.
LLC</strong> Okay.
So maybe a little bit tick up in the tax rate in the fourth quarter then.
I think you should just look at the full year approaching 15% and the math will take care of itself.
Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
I was wondering if you could discuss the operating margin outlook for some of the segments Nutritionals Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals although I know that's a little bit early perhaps at this stage.
But maybe if you could quantify to the extent you're comfortable with at this point where you see those in 12 24 months from now that would be helpful.
Well when you look at the businesses there's a lot of good stories there in terms of operating margin improvement.
Probably leading the pack is our Diagnostics business which a couple 3 years ago before the team really focused on margin expansion we were running in the upper single-digit range.
In this quarter we're in the upper teens range.
We've made tremendous progress in terms of the manufacturing efficiencies but also product mix and pricing and really managing the business better top to bottom.
So that's a very good story for us.
Our Vascular business has done a very nice job in the last few years.
We were in a negative position about 3 4 years ago and moving to the upper 20s in terms of operating margins in that business.
I think there's a little more room to go there.
I mean clearly we've made a lot of progress.
And I would remind people that that operating margin includes about $150 million of non-cash amortization expense.
But we've made significant progress there and there's probably a little bit of room to go.
Some of our smaller businesses but still significant Medical Optics Diabetes Care still great opportunities there.
In particular diabetes has executed on nice margin expansion and we think more of that will continue going forward.
Now Nutritionals this year is artificially depressed by the impact of the infant formula from last year but we're recovering very nicely from that as John mentioned in his remarks and we should see a better operating margin this year.
The one thing I will say is that that's a business we do continue to invest in commercially.
So some of the gross margin improvements we expect there will be invested back in the business because we continue to see really great growth opportunities across these markets and they're pretty responsive to commercial investments.
And so while we expect progress this year and in future years on margin it'll be a little bit slower in the Nutrition business because of the ongoing growth opportunities in that business.
Great.
That's very helpful.
If I could just follow up with one on HUMIRA.
I think if I heard you correctly you mentioned $1 billion of revenue from new indications.
And I was wondering if you could just go into a little bit more detail on that in terms of timing and indication beyond ulcerative colitis I think which is for the end of this year.
Right.
We would expect action by the agencies Europe and the U.S.
here towards the end of the year on ulcerative colitis.
We're also working in Phase III in uveitis.
That has a potential market entry in the 2013 timeframe.
The Phase IIIs are ongoing at this point.
We've got again this other indication in a skin disease that most commonly affects the sweat glands known as HS.
That could be a potential market entry in 2014.
And then we kind of have this umbrella indication for inflammatory joint diseases that would include a number of subgroups that don't have call it a major indication at this point but like reactive arthritis in a number of different other smaller indications.
That when you collectively look at those again over that period of time probably later this year for UC '13 for uveitis '14 for HS and the spine indication could be an entry into 2012.
The peak there is in excess of $1 billion in our minds and we think that each of those probably have a several hundred million dollar opportunity over time.
So that's kind of how they break down at this point.
But greater than $1 billion of incremental from here is pretty significant.
Our next question is from Sara Michelmore from Brean Murray.
Carret &amp; Co.
LLC</strong> Larry this is I guess the second quarter you've broken out AndroGel and CREON.
Could you just talk about the growth trajectory of those products? And just in terms of addressable market sizes et cetera just so we can get a sense of how big they could be eventually? Yes.
I don't think I can put a total cap on where they could go but certainly AndroGel is becoming a fairly significant product here with the sales that I talked about for the quarter if you annualize that.
CREON a little bit smaller but the growth rates on both of them continue to be very strong double digits.
And both products have leadership in their respective categories.
So we're very optimistic for our Proprietary Pharma business with both of these 2 products.
And a new formulation of AndroGel that we just got approved is also very helpful.
Again it's lower volume and it is a much-improved product for patients.
So we're very pleased.
And then again this infant dosing indication that we got for CREON as well gives us a nice opportunity albeit in a smaller piece of that market but nonetheless an advantage and a uniqueness to CREON that others don't have.
Carret &amp; Co.
LLC</strong> Okay.
And then just in the pipeline you guys have clearly gone out in the last 12 maybe 18 months and assembled a series of partnerships here to kind of fill in the pipeline in terms of external resource Phase II moving into Phase III type of candidates.
Where are you in that process in terms of building the pipeline? I mean should we consider -- continue to expect you to be active there or have you done a lot of activity and things should slow down from here? I think we're still open to opportunities to further expand the number of bets we have in the late-stage pipeline.
You never can have enough in Proprietary Pharma.
As you know the regulatory and clinical processes are challenging.
I do think we have done a very nice job of supplementing the portfolio with 4 or 5 really really promising late-stage programs and we're real happy with where we stand now.
And I think even compared to a year ago our late-stage pipeline is significantly more advanced and promising than people would have expected.
So our licensing organization is very good at this.
They work closely with the business to identify good opportunities that we can leverage Abbott's capabilities.
And we continue to be open to opportunities there.
Carret &amp; Co.
LLC</strong> And it seems like a lot of the activity is aligned with your commercial strengths rather than a therapeutic category-type strategy.
Is that a fair assessment? I'd say in today's world it's the quality of the science that's really the first screen.
You can't be overly selective in terms of therapeutic areas of focus.
It's timing compounds or biologics that really have proof of concept and have a good chance in making it to market is really the first screen.
Because we've shown through HUMIRA for example that we can build commercial presence fairly readily particularly in specialty areas if you have a high-quality product to bring to market.
So that really is the first screen.
The other thing I would say is our international proprietary organization in particular is extremely strong and well respected in the markets and well established.
And that is a -- that international distribution asset is one that we do explain to potential licensing partners very extensively.
And we've made some pretty nice progress identifying opportunities to bring in there.
So it's a combination of our strengths and things we bring to the party.
But also if there's good science that we think we can commercialize we're open to something that might be a little outside of our wheelhouse from time to time.
Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
So just quickly.
Tom you were talking about of the Established Pharmaceuticals business $775 million of that $1.3 billion was emerging markets which grew 25% year-over-year.
Is that right? My question is this.
The remaining $560 million or so of that $1.3 billion I mean you're showing operational growth of just $3.2 billion and I know there's a lot of noise there.
But if emerging markets is up 25% what -- can you just describe the performance of the remaining $564 million in sales? Well we're lapping some issues in the quarter.
Reductil is one.
That's a product that has been assigned.
As you know we have no Reductil sales in 2011 but we did have a fair amount of Reductil...
What were the size of those? I don't have that at my fingertips here Jami.
There were some smaller products and I mentioned in Mike's question.
Lanzaprazole for example in a few markets went generic during the quarter.
There are a couple of other of those.
So there were definitely some transitional products during the quarter that dampened down the non-emerging markets growth of Established Pharmaceuticals but we think that that's going to really work its way out of this system in the first half of this year.
And we do expect a nice pickup.
And another product that was off a little bit growth-wise compared to the prior year was Clarithromycin.
And as you know that's a product that goes up and down with the season depending on the year.
So there's some noise in there but we do think it's going to pick up and we've worked through a number of these.
So you would expect operational sales growth in the third quarter to pick up from the 3.2%.
Because that 3.2% also includes Piramal which wasn't in the numbers a year ago.
Absolutely.
You'll see better growth than that.
Our next question is from Damien Conover from MorningStar.
Just a question on the global anti-TNF market penetration.
In previous quarters you talked about penetration rates in RA in the mid-20s in the U.S.
mid-teens internationally.
For Crohn's in the low 20s in the U.S.
and low teens internationally and lower for the derm markets.
Wondering if we could get an update on where those penetration rates are currently.
And then also what kind of strategies are you using to kind of increase the penetration? And also what are the key areas of potential resistance given the relatively low penetration rates for the class? Sure Damien.
This is Larry.
Your penetration rate assumptions are fairly accurate at this point in time as I look across them.
In the U.S.
rheum would kind of be in the mid-20s.
X U.S.
is probably in the mid-teens maybe a little north of 15% in that 15% to 20% range.
Derm as you mentioned -- I mean I'll give you a number.
You said it's lower it's actually low singles in both the U.S.
and x U.S.
kind of in that 5% 6% 7% range depending on when you measure it.
So there's a lot of opportunity there.
And in gastro I think you were right on with low 20s in the U.S.
and kind of low double digit or low teens x U.S.
So you were very close.
I think the key really that continues in the international markets is the overall cost/benefit of a product like HUMIRA.
In single-payer systems that really makes a lot of sense to them in that a product like HUMIRA saves considerable downstream costs whether that's unemployment costs surgical costs things like that.
The upfront investment of treating a patient with HUMIRA certainly pays significantly downstream.
The penetration rates in derm in the past have probably been down in this range.
In Europe they don't quite treat it as severely as a disease state the moderate to severe psoriasis patient.
In the U.S.
we tend to treat them just a little bit more frequently although the penetration rate in the U.S.
is still fairly low.
But I think that overall the strategy of cost/benefit is really the key for us and that plays certainly very well when you're discussing a product like this with single-payer systems.
And our final question is from Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.
I wanted to ask you a quick question on Nutritionals.
And then if I had time for a follow-up on the pipeline.
On Nutritionals you've said a lot about that business Miles.
But I'm just wondering your competitor that has disclosed sort of operating margins more in the 20 mid-20s range.
And I wonder is that an operating margin target that's reasonable for your business as your geography and your mix of products evolves over time? And then I have a follow up on the pipeline.
Right.
Well absolutely.
We have greater aspirations on margins in our Nutrition business.
Before we had the kind of transitional year here we had -- as we recover market share in the U.S.
we were in the upper teens range.
And then obviously with the recovery in the domestic market we've gone down a little bit this year and we expect that to recover somewhat in the second half but still be below 2010.
I don't know any reason structurally why we couldn't be at levels at or close to the competition.
And we've talked a little bit about this publicly that that particular management team is very very focused on operating margin expansion.
We're kind of running a balance there between investing in growth as I've talked about on this call and driving operating margin so we're going to try to do both.
But there are a lot of initiatives going on in the logistics manufacturing area to drive cost out and get our operating margins much closer to some of the levels you're seeing at other companies.
So I think that is certainly over a medium term an achievable objective.
And the management team is very focused on delivering on that.
Right.
And then just a follow-up on the pipeline.
Could you talk about your strategic interest in investment in the cardio metabolic area? Obviously you're moving towards the exclusivity loss of Niaspan and TriCor.
And of course you have bardoxolone.
But is this an area of strategic importance for you guys? Well the cardiology the primary care products we have in lipids and those areas are clearly mature for us.
And as we look at the development of science in these areas it does seem that there's not a lot of new opportunities and a lot of the needs have been met by the existing products.
So we are focused more in other areas both from a R&amp;D perspective and from a M&amp;A perspective.
And I think you're going to see the mix of our portfolio shift to more specialty products.
We talked a lot about them today in the pipeline review.
You see immunology products HCV products a lot of other areas where we think there's more opportunity to deliver more benefits for patients than there is in the cardiology space.
Thank you.
And that concludes our conference call today.
As I mentioned earlier in the call we'll also now be posting to our website a slide deck that highlights our recent pipeline progress in some of the select areas.
And that's something that as I said we'll be building on going forward.

Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.
With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr.
John Thomas Vice President Investor Relations and Public Affairs.
Thanks Elan.
Good morning everyone.
Thanks for joining us.
Today we're going to be discussing 2 important Abbott news events.
First our announcement to separate into 2 independent publicly-traded companies one in diversified medical products and the other in research-based pharmaceuticals.
And second we'll be talking about our strong third quarter ongoing earnings results.
Joining me on today's call is Miles White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman our Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer; Rick Gonzalez Executive Vice President Global Pharmaceuticals and Larry Peepo Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations.
Miles and Rick will review the strategic rationale related to our announcement this morning as well as provide an overview of each of these new companies and their investment identities.
Tom will discuss certain financial aspects and conclude with a brief review of our third quarter results which we summarized today to allow for sufficient time to discuss today's other major announcements.
Details on our third quarter can be found in our earnings news release.
Following our comments today of course we'll take any questions you have as always.
I'd also note that we posted a 12-page slide deck to our Abbott website this morning at www.abbottinvestor.com and this deck summarizes the details of our announcement this morning regarding the separation.
In addition this morning I'm pleased to announced that we will be hosting a 2-hour Investor Meeting this coming Friday in New York.
Miles Rick Gonzalez Tom Freyman as well as Dr.
John Leonard our Head of Pharmaceutical Research and Development will be in attendance along with myself Larry and some other people from our Investor Relations and Media Department.
At Friday's meeting we'll discuss the growth opportunities in Abbott's diversified medical products business as well as growth opportunities in the research-based pharmaceutical company.
We're going to walk you through the pharmaceutical pipeline in more detail and we'll spotlight certain programs that we're particularly enthused about including early data from our HCV trials and Rick will talk about -- more about that in a minute.
So given that you're going to hear from us this coming Friday we're going to try to limit and focus our call today and try to keep it to approximately an hour.
Before we get started let me remind you that some statements may be forward-looking including the planned separation of the research-based  pharmaceutical company from the diversified medical products company and the expected financial results of the 2 companies after separation.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and there is no assurance as to the timing of the planned separation or whether it will be completed.
Economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2010 and then the interim reports filed on Form 10-Q for subsequent quarterly periods.
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments.
On today's conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release as well as regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
And with that I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Miles.
Miles? Okay thanks John.
Good morning.
As you can see from our strong third quarter results Abbott delivered another quarter of strong performance across our mix of businesses.
Our ongoing earnings per share growth was more than 12% as we've now posted double-digit growth in 17 of our last 18 quarters.
We'll generate similar performance for the full year which will again place us among the top performers in our peer group.
So we're pleased with our consistent financial performance.
But as evidenced by today's other important news we are taking a significant next step in aligning our long-term strategic goals with our shareholders' best interest.
Today's announcement to separate into 2 publicly-traded companies in diversified medical products and research-based pharmaceuticals is a logical step in the further evolution of our company.
Over the past 12 years our actions have dramatically reshaped Abbott.
Let me give you some background and examples.
Since 1998 Abbott has nearly quadrupled in revenues to nearly $40 billion in annual sales.
During that same 12-year period we shifted our geographic sales mix from what was more than 60% U.S.-based sales in 1998 to more than 60% international sales today.
In 2001 the reshaping of our pharmaceutical business began in earnest when we purchased Knoll Pharmaceuticals which included an R&amp;D program that's now called by its well-known commercial name HUMIRA.
As you know HUMIRA is on track to soon become the world's leading biologic for autoimmune diseases with annual sales this year of approximately $8 billion.
And today our total research-based pharmaceutical business generates nearly $18 billion in annual sales.
In 2006 we globalized our leading Nutritionals business to sharpen its focus and better capture international growth opportunities and it worked.
We doubled the division's international sales over the last 5 years.
Also in 2006 we acquired Guidant vascular and subsequently built our existing vascular business into a leading interventional cardiology company headlined by the number one global drug-eluting stent brand XIENCE.
In the last 4 years we've also rebuilt our core diagnostic business to deliver higher returns doubling its operating margin and significantly improving its cash flow.
So these are just some of the actions that we've taken over the last decade.
More recently we've moved to advance our strategy with an eye toward 2 major initiatives: rapid expansion in fast-growing emerging markets and a concerted effort to reenergize and retool our research and development pipeline.
To that end we significantly accelerated our emerging markets presence with the acquisitions of Solvay and Piramal Healthcare Solutions the latter of which has positioned Abbott as the largest pharmaceutical company in India the second fastest growing pharmaceutical market in the world.
We also created a new Established Pharmaceuticals division a separate fully integrated $5-billion branded generics pharmaceutical business that provides the infrastructure to expand in emerging markets.
And we aggressively rebuilt our late stage research-based pharmaceutical pipeline through concentrated internal R&amp;D efforts as well as strategic in-licensing and late stage collaboration.
In the last 4 years alone we've tripled the number of new molecular entities.
And in the last 2 years we've doubled our late stage programs.
Each of these major strategic changes plus other advancements that we've made along the way has continually strengthened Abbott to better compete in our ever changing healthcare environment.
The news we announced today to separate into 2 independent companies is driven by the same disciplined deliberate and aggressive process.
As John mentioned we'll be hosting an Investor Meeting in New York this Friday morning to further discuss today's news including details on the 2 companies' growth prospects and new product pipelines which offer both companies the opportunity for stronger and more sustainable growth.
So given our 2-hour Analyst Meeting in Friday we're going to keep our comments brief today touching on only the strategic rationale the key benefits to shareholders and a summary of each respective company's unique investment identity.
The strategic rationale and action behind today's announcement is the result as I said of a deliberate and exacting process and part of the strategic evolution that's been underway for quite some time.
We're now ready to separate into 2 independent publicly-traded companies because the investment identity and the operating model of each separate enterprise is very different from the other.
It's just that simple and straightforward.
Our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business is more research intensive than the rest of Abbott and that's by design based on its business needs and strong sources of cash flow and earnings power.
As you're all aware pharmaceutical and biologic companies have to produce innovative medical treatments that demonstrate clear patient benefits.
These specialized proprietary medicines are more often used in the developed world including the U.S.
and Europe where best-in-class therapies generate significant demand.
The majority of revenues for this new pharma company will be generated from developed markets with 45% of revenues outside the United States.
So that's a snapshot of the new Proprietary Pharmaceuticals company.
The Abbott diversified medical products company has countless sources of high-growth opportunities that are well-balanced across literally hundreds of different product brands different business franchises and different payers.
The pipeline includes dozens of game-changing medical technologies next-generation diagnostic systems and devices newly-formulated nutritional brands and an array of other incremental enhancements such as consumer-friendly packaging new product flavors and other meaningful brand initiatives.
The diversified medical products company will embody a vast portfolio of medical technologies and consumer Nutritionals that will resonate in the developed world but even more importantly in the most rapidly growing emerging markets where Abbott is well positioned.
We've taken actions over the last several years to pick up our pace of expansion into international markets that offer the most promising growth prospects based on improving socio-economic conditions.
This is nowhere more evident than in the key BRIC countries such as India.
Abbott is the #1 company in India because we moved quickly on a unique asset in Piramal Healthcare Solutions.
It was a rare opportunity so we acted fast and we're pleased that we did.
So in summary there's no question that both our research-based pharmaceutical and diversified medical products businesses have evolved over time in very different ways into 2 very distinct and compelling investment identity.
For example the new pharmaceutical company is today generating nearly $18 billion in annual sales.
It's delivered market-leading performance including double-digit top line growth in 4 of the last 5 years.
That performance was built on a sustainable mix of well-known prescription brands including HUMIRA.
Going forward we've strengthened the pharmaceutical pipeline through more productive discovery and development strategic in-licensing agreements and select late stage collaborations.
This company will generate robust and sustainable cash flow with the flexibility to accelerate pipeline programs as needed and the ability to leverage breakthrough medications that can deliver meaningful benefits for patients.
The end result should be strong and steady shareholder returns including a competitive dividend policy.
I'm pleased to announce today that the research-based pharmaceutical company which will be named at a later date will be led by Rick Gonzales a 30-year Abbott veteran who currently serves as Executive Vice President of our Global Pharmaceutical business.
Rick has served in numerous senior leadership positions throughout his Abbott career including Head of our Medical Products business and for several years as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer.
Those investors who followed us over the years know that Rick is an experienced well-respected senior leader within Abbott as well as within the healthcare industry.
I have every confidence that Rick will do an exceptional job as Chairman and CEO of the new Proprietary Pharmaceuticals company.
I don't think it could be in better hands.
I will continue to serve in my current position as Abbott's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
So let me quickly summarize what the new Abbott will look like and again we'll talk more about this on Friday.
Abbott as a diversified medical products company will generate revenues of approximately $22 billion in sales supported by a multitude of durable high-growth franchises.
Our portfolio will remain as well-balanced as it is today with 4 major business segments each roughly similar in size including Nutritionals Established Pharmaceuticals Diagnostics and Medical Devices which encompasses our vascular devices Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses.
Approximately 40% of our customer mix will be self-pay making it generally less dependent on the U.S.
economy.
In fact approximately 30% of total Abbott diversified medical product sales will be generated in the United States with 70% of sales generated x U.S.
Emerging markets sales will be the largest geographic component and nearly 40% of total Abbott diversified medical product sales.
We'll continue to expand in emerging markets because that's where the growth is and that growth is now 3x the growth rate of the developed world.
We also plan to more effectively leverage the power of the Abbott corporate brand across each of these diversified medical product segments.
For example in our global Nutritionals and branded generics businesses we'll take advantage of channel synergies to more efficiently reach our growing customer base.
So what can investors expect from the diversified medical products company in terms of growth? Well here's what I expect.
I expect the company to deliver at least high single-digit sales growth and sustainable double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth which should place it among the most attractive large cap healthcare investments.
We'll achieve this with balanced success across Nutritionals Established Pharmaceuticals Diagnostics and Medical Devices.
Nutritionals will be the largest business for now and one of the strongest global players in the industry with well-known brands such as Similac and Ensure.
It generates high return on invested capital and very strong cash flow.
We expect to grow our worldwide Nutritional sales at a double-digit pace with a cadence of new product launches and increased penetration in key international markets such as China India and Brazil.
We'll also significantly improve both the gross margin and operating margin profile of this business.
Our Established Pharmaceuticals Division or EPD is among the leading branded generics businesses in the world generating more than $5 billion in sales from a portfolio that's composed of literally hundreds of different brands.
EPD enjoys a significant commercial footprint and boast a registration pipeline of more than 1 000 individual products which are beginning to launch now in numerous geographic markets.
As a result we expect EPD to generate sustainable mid-to-high single-digit sales over the next several years with strong double-digit sales growth in the largest emerging markets.
We'll continue to optimize its cost structure as well driving efficiencies where needed.
Our Global Diagnostics business includes the world's leading immunoassay and blood screening businesses as well as our faster growing point of care and molecular diagnostic segments which today are modest in size but will be meaningful to earnings in just a few short years.
We expect molecular diagnostics for example to exceed $1 billion in sales by 2015.
Our concerted effort to dramatically improve bottom line performance in diagnostics has resulted in steady operating margin expansion.
That will continue as will better cash flow generation.
And finally we have Medical Devices.
We define this segment with our global vascular business our Diabetes Care business and our Vision Care business.
As you know our vascular business has a healthy and strong commercial presence that's defined by the industry's best-in-class drug-eluting stent XIENCE.
In a matter of just a few short years XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME have captured the #1 share position in what is a competitive DES global marketplace.
But this is not just a XIENCE story we have an industry-leading pipeline that contains upward of 20 new products with a near-term launch of XIENCE PRIME in the U.S.
and a robust pipeline of DES structural heart and endovascular development programs.
These range from our bioresorbable vascular scaffold or BVS which has the potential to restate the DES market to our MitraClip  next-generation structural heart valve.
In Diabetes Care we'll continue to focus on the insulin-dependent patient a segment where we're growing faster than any other competitor in the U.S.
And in Vision Care we expect to launch numerous new products and technology advancements over the next several years with an eye toward operating margin expansion.
In summary the new diversified medical products company will maintain Abbott's heritage of financial strength with abundant sources of revenues and cash flows and considerable flexibility to invest in strategic priorities and new growth initiatives.
The company will be a well-balanced blend of diverse healthcare businesses and new geographies driven by a broad mix of payers and unique base of customers many of whom are living in high-growth emerging markets where income levels are steadily on the rise along with socio-economic conditions.
So with approximately $22 billion in sales the diversified medical product should be without question one of the most attractive and largest healthcare investment opportunities.
It should also be among the fastest growing.
Abbott's high single-digit top line growth coupled with continued margin expansion will deliver sustainable double-digit ongoing EPS.
As the environment has changed so too has our company.
We've reshaped advanced and grown Abbott in a manner that makes today's news possible.
As a result of this separation our shareholders will benefit from 2 new companies that have evolved into 2 distinct investment opportunities and identities.
With that I'll now turn the call over to Rick to discuss the new research-based pharmaceutical company in more detail.
Rick? Thank you Miles and good morning.
As Miles indicated our new research-based pharmaceutical company has a long track record of demonstrated commercial and operating strengths.
These attributes position us well for sustainable performance going forward and help us succeed when we become an independent publicly-traded company.
Having worked in leadership positions across Abbott for quite some time including leading our pharmaceutical business for the last 2 years I can tell you this is truly a very strong business.
It's an organization with a long track record of industry-leading performance.
This includes double-digit sales growth 4 out of last 5 years a significant accomplishment in today's healthcare environment.
The fact that we have maintained such strong performance underscores the strength and experience of our pharmaceutical management team.
We have industry-leading specialty-focused portfolios that include a mix of growth brands such as HUMIRA as well as sustainable performers such as Synthroid and Lupron among others.
Over the past several years we built a promising R&amp;D pipeline of specialty medicines focused on important disease states such as Hepatitis C chronic kidney disease multiple sclerosis oncology and other areas of significant medical need.
Since I will providing a more detailed overview of our pharmaceutical business and R&amp;D pipeline on Friday I'll keep my message focused on 2 basic things today.
First the sustainable performance of our existing commercial portfolio.
And second a brief review of select highlights from our advanced late stage pharmaceutical pipeline.
Our new research-based pharmaceutical company generates nearly $18 billion in annual sales today driven by strong marketing presence and leadership positions across more than 20 major pharmaceutical brands.
These include: HUMIRA our market-leading biologic for immune diseases which has an 8-year track record of commercial success; Kaletra and Norvir Abbott discovery HIV protease inhibitors that changed the global landscape of HIV treatment; Synthroid for thyroid disease one of the most widely-prescribed medicines that doctors choose to give their patients in the U.S.; Lupron a market-leading therapy for prostate cancer endometriosis and other conditions; Synagis a biologic for infants suffering from respiratory disease; CREON a leading therapy for conditions associated with cystic fibrosis; AndroGel the #1 therapy for correcting low testosterone levels in men and numerous other medications.
So let's start with HUMIRA which will remain a significant growth driver for our new independent company.
HUMIRA has the best-in-class profile including a strong track record of demonstrated clinical performance utility across a broad spectrum of indications and a well-established safety profile.
And these strengths have played out in the marketplace as evidenced by HUMIRA's strong ongoing performance.
Despite the entry of several new competitors over the last few years HUMIRA continues to gain market share and demonstrate strong growth and there's plenty of runway left.
As Miles said this year we expect annual sales for HUMIRA to reach approximately $8 billion.
This level of performance is a testament to the outstanding commercial execution as well as the significant benefits HUMIRA delivers for a wide array of patients suffering from serious medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis Crohn's disease psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis and others.
I expect our organization to sustain this positive momentum as it drives to meet the demand in an expanding overall anti-TNF market where penetration rates remain low across all 3 therapeutic areas: rheumatology dermatology and GI.
We will also add to our broad list of approved uses for HUMIRA with the launch of several new indications as well as other product enhancements that we anticipate will further improve the overall patient experience.
In addition to our proactive long-term growth strategy we planned for some possible changes in the anti-TNF market; including the potential approval of an oral competitor as well as the possible entry of biosimilars in the later years of our long-range plan.
Orals and biosimilars may both someday have a place in the market but their potential entry will not materially change HUMIRA's strong growth profile.
HUMIRA will remain a growing sustainable and leading commercial global brand in the years to come.
The global anti-TNF biologic market is significant and continues to grow nicely.
In addition to HUMIRA several other market-leading brands in our current portfolio will complement our total company sales growth story.
To that end we expect this portfolio including HUMIRA's sustainable robust growth outlook to help us achieve an expected total top line growth profile for the new company of flat to low single-digit sales growth in 2013 and '14 consistent with Wall Street consensus and similar to our pharmaceutical peers.
Factored into this growth outlook are realistic expectations for our more mature lipids franchise which we've said in the past will see generic entrance beginning in mid-2012.
And beginning in 2015 we expect our sales growth to accelerate based on HUMIRA's continued strong underlying growth as well as the launch of new products from our late stage pipeline.
So finally let me touch briefly on select highlights from our pipeline which I'll cover in more detail on Friday.
Like all pharmaceutical and biotech companies our business relies on a productive R&amp;D engine capable of generating a steady stream of products that serve unmet patient clinical needs.
Over the past few years we've rapidly advanced our internal programs such Hep C and we've added 11 new assets through a concerted focus on strategic licensing acquisitions and partnering activity.
As a result we've tripled the number of new molecular entities with more than 30 in human cynical trials today.
We now have a total of 20 new compounds or indications in Phase II and Phase III development.
Our focus is on medicines that hold promise in difficult to treat diseases with significant market opportunities.
Our goal is to develop products that have strong clinical performance and deliver meaningful economic value in today's healthcare environment.
Bardoxolone a compound we license from Reata Pharmaceuticals is a great example of this.
This treatment which is in Phase III development for chronic kidney disease has the potential to dramatically change the treatment landscape.
Current therapies only modestly slow the progression of the disease while bardoxolone has the potential to markedly improve patient outcomes.
We expect commercialization for bardoxolone as early as 2014.
In neuroscience we're addressing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's schizophrenia pain and MS.
Daclizumab our next generation biologic for MS is in Phase III development.
Our recently announced results from our Phase II registrational trial suggest that daclizumab may offer patients the right balance of high efficacy and a manageable safety profile.
We expect to launch in 2015.
I'm also particularly enthused about our internal Hepatitis C development program.
Our compounds have the potential to dramatically change how patients are treated today by improving tolerability and cure rates and significantly shortening therapy duration.
We're projecting market entry in 2015 for a triple combination HCV therapy.
On Friday for the first time we'll give you a preview of some select early-stage data from our HCV program.
These 3 opportunities alone bardoxolone daclizumab and HCV can together generate multibillion-dollar peak year sales if successful.
In addition we have other promising medicines progressing through our pipeline and we'll discuss some of these on Friday as well.
In summary we have a very compelling opportunity to create a new independent publicly-traded pharmaceutical company with a distinct identity for our shareholders.
Today we're very fortunate to have a unique sustainable growth driver in HUMIRA one of the most successful pharmaceutical products of all time as well as leadership positions in a host of other sustainable global commercial brands.
We also expect to see meaningful contributions from our pipeline in the coming years.
In the meantime over the next 12 months we will focus on running the global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business within Abbott just as we would normally.
As you know this business has strong margins and generates robust sustainable cash flow.
As an independent company this financial strength provides the opportunity for healthy returns to shareholders including an industry competitive dividend.
With that let me turn the call over to Tom for some transaction details.
Thanks Rick.
Let me review some of the key aspects of the transaction as we see them today.
We expect to accomplish the separation through a tax-free distribution to shareholders.
At the time of separation Abbott's then current shareholders will own 100% of both publicly-traded companies.
The final distribution ratio will be determined later in the process.
We expect the separation to be completed by the end of next year subject to regulatory approval and final approval of the distribution of shares of the new company by our Board of Directors.
Both companies are expected to have strong balance sheets and cash flow to support the strong investment-grade credit rating.
Credit ratings for the 2 companies will be determined by the rating agencies based upon financial projection and capital structures that will be determined in the coming months.
We'd expect a tender for a portion of the current Abbott long-term debt outstanding in conjunction with this transaction funded with debt issued by the new pharmaceutical company.
It's expected that Abbott and the new pharmaceutical company will pay a dividend that when combined would equal the Abbott dividend at the time of separation.
We expect to incur onetime separation costs including bond refinancing costs over the course of the separation process.
These costs will be quantified at a future date and will be treated as onetime items in our quarterly reporting.
As a result there's no impact from this separation to our 2011 ongoing earnings per share guidance.
The complete audited financial statements that will result in a 3-year financial history for the new pharmaceutical company this information will be part of a Form 10 filing which is targeted to occur in the next few months.
And finally we expect to complete this process in an efficient manner given the experience in integration and separation that we built over the years.
I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary of our third quarter earnings release.
As you've now seen we reported very strong third quarter results that beat the Street estimates and were at the high-end of our forecast.
We delivered another quarter of double-digit sales and ongoing earnings growth with ongoing earnings per share of $1.18 up 12.4%.
And we confirmed our full year outlook for double-digit ongoing EPS growth in 2011.
Sales growth in the quarter was 13.2% including a favorable 5.3% impact from exchange rates.
Organic sales growth in the quarter was nearly 7%.
The majority of our major businesses have delivered double digit reported sales growth.
This includes more than 15% growth for Durable Growth businesses driven by double-digit growth in Nutritional Core Laboratory Diagnostics Diabetes Care and Established Pharmaceuticals.
Our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business also delivered strong growth with reported sales up more than 13%.
This reflects impressive worldwide performance for HUMIRA which increased nearly 26% on a reported basis and more than 18% excluding exchange.
HUMIRA is on track to exceed the sales guidance of high teens growth that we raised just last quarter.
In our innovation-driven device businesses sales increased 6% including continued double-digit growth in molecular diagnostics and double-digit international growth in vascular and medical optics.
And emerging markets continued to represent a significant growth contributor with sales in the quarter of $2.6 billion an increase of 21% consistent with the high growth expectations we have for these markets.
Regarding other aspects of the P&amp;L in the quarter the adjusted gross margin ratio was 60.4% ahead of our previous forecast driven by improved product mix.
As reflected in higher SG&amp;A expense we increased our litigation reserves for previously disclosed litigation identified as a specified item in our earnings release.
Turning to our full year outlook.
Today we're confirming our expectations for double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth for 2011 and narrowing our guidance range.
Our guidance for the full year is $4.64 to $4.66 reflecting 11.5% growth at the midpoint of the range.
For the fourth quarter today we're issuing ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.43 to $1.45.
The midpoint of this ongoing EPS range represents continued double-digit growth over the prior year.
We forecast specified items of $0.30 in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting integrations costs from past acquisitions and cost of previous restructuring actions.
We're forecasting mid-to-high single-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter including a favorable effect from foreign exchange of approximately 1% and a gross margin ratio approaching 61%.
So in summary while we delivered another strong performance in the quarter more significantly we announced a major strategic change for Abbott.
The separation of Abbott into 2 publicly-traded companies creates 2 enterprises that are well positioned in their respective markets.
Abbott is expected to be one of the fastest-growing large cap diversified medical products company with a durable mix of products.
And the research-based pharmaceutical company will be a leader in its industry with a strong and sustainable portfolio of specialty medicines and a promising pipeline.
We believe that both of these companies will be attractive opportunities for investors.
And with that I'll turn the call back to John and we will take your questions.
Thanks Tom.
Elan we're now ready to take questions please.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> I just wanted to ask a couple of questions.
Just apart from splitting up the 2 businesses and getting the higher values for those businesses obviously the device business has been under pressure not under pressure but the multiple has reflected concerns around the HUMIRA franchise and therefore you haven't gotten full value for some of your Durable Growth businesses.
But aside from splitting up the businesses and getting what you would think what you would imagine to be appropriate valuation for the 2 very distinct businesses with different risk and growth profiles going forward.
Can you talk about some of the other advantages to breaking up such as how we should think about capital deployment how we should think about operating margins of these businesses? I mean one thing that we have noticed is that Abbott has a very large overhead or redundancy that I would think would be able to go away if you complete this transaction.
So if you could just talk about some of the other efficiencies that you can create by splitting up the 2 companies.
And then I have a question for Rick on the pharma business.
I mean clearly HUMIRA was a big driver of the overall business and will be an even bigger driver in terms of its contribution to the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business.
With competition coming in the next year or 2 from tofacitinib with competition from biosimilars clearly this will be an issue and I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit about strategies you have in place to protect that franchise? Okay Jami that may be the longest question I've ever experienced in my 13 years.
The fundamental -- let me just get by way of back on the -- the fundamental basis for the separation here.
And I heard a comment this morning from another analyst source that causes me to want to make sure I make the point.
We've always pursued a diverse model and we believe in that model and we believe in the diversity of the business and the growth opportunities it gives us and frankly the reliability and sustainability over time.
But what’s happened here is we've been so successful in our Proprietary Pharma business over time.
It's grown quite large.
And frankly arguably I believe it will be very successful going forward.
I think when the companies are split I believe both will be valued at the top of their peer groups but for very different reasons.
In a portfolio of diverse companies the characteristics of those businesses need to be similar.
And as our Proprietary Pharma business has grown large it has different characteristics and it's also quite dominant now in the portfolio.
And I think that it's given the company clearly an identity of pharma with oh by the way you have these other diverse businesses.
But as you can see by how we proposed to split the company has $22 billion in a very diverse mix of similar characteristic businesses as I described and a very successful Proprietary Pharma business that is delivering great returns and cash flows and has great potential and durability going forward but it's a business that investors seeking return will look to.
Investors who are looking for a large cap diverse double-digit grower aren't necessarily looking for the same type of investment identity as pharma.
So what happens here as the pharma piece got so big and is different that these 2 investments make sense separately and both are of a critical mass and size that they have great sustainability going forward as independent companies et cetera.
And as we divide them their characteristics their P&amp;Ls their balance sheets et cetera are quite different.
The capital structure I'll have Tom deal with in just a minute but both have strong cash flows both have strong pipelines of products arguably they're different.
One is dependent on big products one is dependent on hundreds or thousands of products over time.
The diverse company will be dependent on a lot of market growth and international expansion.
The pharmaceutical company is still quite heavily a developed market company and it will too have emerging market opportunities but it's very much a developed market game.
So they become very different.
And I think that both will be valued more accurately or frankly appreciated more by investors.
And I think we'll see that we attract investors who haven't been in our company or haven't invested in our stock as we allow them the choice of these 2 distinct identities.
I think there's opportunity for operating margin expansion and gross margin expansion particularly in the diverse company.
I think visibility to margins in the pharma company what will compare quite favorably to its peer group.
I think you'll see that.
With regard to the overhead question you asked I would say we're always looking at the opportunity to be more efficient.
And given the distinctive separation of the companies that is something that we will look at because there's a different mix for the pharma business and a different mix for the international-based diverse products business and we will be looking for those opportunities to be a lot more efficient.
That's about all I'd say about that at the time.
But at this point I think...
[Audio Gap] The points I'd make and I think we made these points in the remarks.
I mean both of these companies are going to have extremely strong cash flow both of them are going to have very good balance sheet.
It's going to give both companies a lot of options to use that cash flow.
I mean we've talked about our expectations on the dividend then I -- there will continue to be a dividend in line with what Abbott is paying today is our current view.
The one thing I'd point out on cash flow is between the 2 businesses and if you look at our amortization expense which as you know is a fairly large item in our P&amp;L in the $1.4 billion range.
More of the amortization relates to the diversified company than to the new pharmaceutical company which means that the cash flows are even a little more balanced than the profit levels when you look between the 2 businesses.
So both are healthy.
They're going to have a lot of options and both managements will -- it's kind of a nice problem to have as they move forward as they consider what to do with those cash flows.
Research Division</strong> I was just wondering if Rick was going to address my question or we could wait until Friday but that is going to be the key pushback in my opinion which is the pharma business is now completely dominated by HUMIRA.
And how Rick we should be thinking about that equation going forward with competition coming from tofacitinib and biosimilars 2016? I think it's a very good question Jami.
I'd characterize it this way.
So I'd start at the very top.
If you look at where our pipeline starts to emerge in 2015 and beyond in a very meaningful way it will add to the performance of the business above and beyond HUMIRA.
If you look at the performance of HUMIRA we believe that performance is very sustainable going forward.
In fact if you look back to 2007 HUMIRA has grown on average $1.1 billion every year and we believe that is sustainable and actually slightly accelerating as we move from 2011 to 2012.
Now what drives that is the ability to continue to penetrate the markets that we're in today like RA like psoriasis like Crohn's.
Those markets are still tremendously underpenetrated.
I'll give you an example.
Psoriasis has a penetration rate of about 6%.
Our most mature market RA has a penetration rate in the 20% range.
And so the goal here and you've seen us introduce programs around the world that allow us to be able to drive the market to grow faster to early diagnosis of patients and then cycling them through less effective old therapies more rapidly.
And you've seen that market growth particularly outside the U.S.
emerge very very rapidly where the market is growing mid-teens in many countries around the world even in Europe.
And so there's still a lot of opportunity to drive growth for HUMIRA in the markets we're in today.
Additionally we have 6 indications that we are in the process of developing and submitting for HUMIRA.
Those 6 indications will have a material impact on the growth of the product going forward.
And they're likely to be indications that competition doesn't have at least out of the blocks.
So I would tell you that I feel very confident that HUMIRA has a lot of legs going forward and can continue to be a sustainable growth vehicle for us for a long long time.
Now let me address the competition.
I'll start with orals first.
As we look at this market let's just say from a global standpoint.
This is a very difficult market for competitors to break into.
And you know the data as well as I do.
So 6 competitors have entered the biologic market over the last 5 years.
Not one of them has gotten over 3% market share collectively in total.
All 5 of them have not gotten over 11% market share.
So the 3 major players: us Enbrel and Remicade control between 80% and 90% of this market.
So it's a difficult market to break into because safety is a critical component and those 3 products have the longest safety database of any products on the market and have very good efficacy.
I mean these drugs work well.
They get the efficacy in patients that physicians want to see and patients want to have.
And so this isn't a market that competitors break into easily particularly if they don't have long-term safety data and very good safety data.
Now we don't know what the oral products labels going to look like.
We've looked very carefully.
I've looked very carefully at the data that has come out of their trials thus far and I'd say I'd characterize it right now based on what I know as roughly equivalent efficacy to HUMIRA or other TNFs.
Safety profile that's similar to TNFs from an infection rate maybe slightly higher it's hard to tell based on the data at this point.
And then other safety questions that’ll have to be addressed from labeling standpoint like increases in creatinine increases in anemia that have caused patients to drop out and increases in LDL.
I'd say based on what we believe the profile of a product has to be to get rapid uptake in the market we're relatively comfortable with being able to defend our position against oral products.
Biosimilars I think are a different issue.
First of all as you know our molecular patent doesn't expire until early 2017 in the U.S.
and 2018 in Europe so we feel that the product is very well-protected to that point.
We have numerous IP patents from a process standpoint that go beyond that.
We'll have to see which of those is applicable to any competitor that comes forward.
From a regulatory standpoint clearly in the U.S.
the regulatory path is still undefined.
I think what we do know is that the FDA will hold a biosimilar product to a standard similar to the innovative product from the standpoint of efficacy and safety.
And so that will require in all likelihood significant clinical trial work which will be expensive and time consuming.
But I think the biggest issue will be that in all likelihood these products will not be interchangeable.
In fact I think it's highly unlikely that they will be interchangeable like oral solid generics are.
And so it creates a very different competitive dynamic when they have to go out and apply SG&amp;A and that SG&amp;A has to be effective in the marketplace and they're going to have to sell on their own data.
Not use the innovator's data.
And so it will be a very significant issue to come head-to-head against the established players and be able to take share away.
Now that's not to say that we take either competitor lightly.
I can tell you that we do a lot of planning to try to understand how we're going to be able to deal with that and I think our strategies around that make me feel comfortable that HUMIRA will be a very sustainable brand.
And as I said I also look at our pipeline and I look at a number of the assets in that pipeline that will emerge in 2015 and beyond and I feel pretty comfortable that will be a very meaningful impact going forward.
And our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> Let me do a couple of financial questions first and then talk more strategy and Tom hopefully you can help here.
But maybe 2 quick ones.
Tom first off when I think about the tax structures of these 2 businesses the proprietary pharma piece would seem to have a lot lower tax structure versus the durable medical products business.
Am I thinking about that correctly? And is there any damage to the tax structure from the split? I'm assuming no but if you could give me your thoughts on that that will be helpful.
Yes Mike we're not going to go into a lot of modeling issue today as we talked about in the beginning.
We're trying to focus today more on the strategic discussion here.
What I would say is I think it's accurate that between the 2 companies the diversified will be a little bit higher than the other company but that's about as much as we'll share with you today.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then on the proprietary piece can you give us an estimate of the percentage of the profits in the proprietary piece that would come from HUMIRA post-spin? As you know we -- if you're looking at -- just to get a sense of profitability on these businesses we do disclose in our segment footnotes these businesses broken out.
So that gives you a good sense overall.
And clearly HUMIRA is an important product for us.
You can have a sense of the relative sales and -- so it's definitely an important part of that business.
But as Rick said it's one that we think has a very long-term future lots of growth opportunity continuing to grow new indications and plenty of opportunity to be a long-term contributor to the business.
Research Division</strong> Okay last financial piece.
You talked Miles about growth in some of the DMP pieces or medical profits pieces.
You talked about Nutritionals growing double digits.
You talked about some other pieces including vascular.
You often suggest that those businesses would accelerate like Nutritionals globally hasn't grown double digits.
It's grown more like high-single digits and so there was some expectation that growth would accelerate.
Could you just maybe touch on why should we assume that those businesses accelerate and how DMP goes from being what right now looks to be more mid-single digits to high-single digits? Yes we'll go into more on it on Friday Mike.
But actually let me correct you.
Nutrition has grown double digits outside the United States and frankly I do expect even more acceleration from the businesses particularly as we expand the footprint in emerging markets and internationally.
So I do expect not only acceleration of the sales but also acceleration of the bottom line.
And those programs are underway.
But this is the -- the performance and elements are there now and we are seeing that.
At any given point in time one country or another is going to look different than the mix of the whole.
But yes we can talk about that more on Friday.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Just so I'm clear you're taking the whole Nutritionals business not just international piece right? You mean on this side of the business? Research Division</strong> Yes right.
Yes.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
All right Okay.
Because I was talking about overall growth profile in Nutritionals but...
Yes you'd be right about overall but the international piece has doubled in size in the last 5 years and we can back into that growth rate that's clearly double digits.
Research Division</strong> Right absolutely.
So let me just talk more strategy stuff.
So I guess what people are asking me probably #1 today is the decision on why today versus a year ago or a year from now so the timing question.
And then 2 in your -- in the math that you did on this in trying to -- you're going to go through a very tough process here in splitting the company up.
How much value in your estimation are you unlocking by the math that you guys did in doing this to make it worthwhile? I'm going to enjoy answering that one.
Let me address the why now.
There's actually method in the madness as to why now.
As you know we acquired Solvay and Piramal and we went through an integration process.
And then frankly a separation process internally of our Proprietary Pharma business and our Established Pharmaceutical business which are very very different businesses.
So we had kind of a double task there of not only the integration of the legacy Abbott businesses but also those 2 new ones and not to mention our additional agreement with Zydus in India which enhanced our product lines.
But there was a process there to establish that infrastructure and stabilize all of that and separate the 2 pharma businesses.
That is essentially complete.
And that was necessary work to do regardless.
But we needed that to be complete and we also wanted some of our pipeline initiatives on the Proprietary Pharmaceutical side to have been completed.
And frankly our internal organic pipeline to have advanced in order to be at a point of what we would consider to be readiness.
Those are the primary drivers of why now.
I don't think we'd have been ready a year ago and I think we are ready now.
We've got the positioning and a lot of the work done so that the difficulty of separation frankly has -- a lot of it's been done and it's ready to go.
So there's no real point in waiting now as we get on with it.
With regard to unlocking as you might guess I've looked at more investment banker and consultant and other presentations and estimations and so forth of the so-called unlocking of value.
I would not venture an estimate or a guess because I've been here long enough to have seen a PE of a company in the high 20s and a PE in the low teens or whatever.
You can talk about unlocking value.
But at the end of the day the background of what's happening in a marketplace with the values of companies as a whole of the economy as a whole can clearly affect that up or down.
Do I think investors will realize or see or recognize higher value on both sides of the company as separate companies? I do.
I think investors will appreciate both companies more than is the case today because I think there will be a lot greater appreciation and attraction to investors who focus on these 2 very different investment profiles.
The same investor doesn't invest in both profiles necessarily and vice versa.
So I think we'll see appreciation for both companies.
But what happens in the overall marketplace over time I don't know.
So I wouldn't venture a guess.
I leave that to you guys.
Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
And Miles really just 2 questions.
One any considerations instead of a tax-free spend for an outright sell of the pharma business and maybe even to some degree even rights to HUMIRA as one would think about this perceived unlocking of value or either less reliance on a single product? And then the second question's a little more related to strategy.
And if you go back to your Q4 comments one asked either about sentiment around HUMIRA or either selling the -- or spending out the Nutritionals business.
You commented or at least the sentiment I took away was that the sentiment in the market is wrong.
We need to do a better job of really talking about each particular business and the long-term opportunities and you seemed to harp on this notion of if you make a knee-jerk decision on what the market wants you to do in the very very near term you may be wrong a year or 2 years or 3 or 5 years later.
And I'd like for you to comment on that because that seems to be slightly different in tone than what we see today.
Okay.
Let me deal with the first part did we consider a selling? I think the obvious here is first of all that would take a long time.
And secondly the tax on a sale like that and whether there was somebody that was interested in such a thing is prohibited.
Now I have to tell you I think we've got 2 long-term sustainable companies here.
We have no interest in selling.
We have no intention to sell.
We're not looking to sell it or merge it with something else et cetera.
We think we've got the best path for investors here which is 2 independent companies going forward that both have great cash flow profits growth prospects et cetera depending on the company here.
But they're 2 different investments.
And I think that for investors and for the sustainability of these investments is the right path for both companies.
Otherwise I don't think we're doing the right thing if we just try to sell it.
That doesn't strike me as the right path here at all which is why we believe the path of separation and letting investors appreciate each country -- company appropriately is the right path.
With regard to the last call or whatever that you're referencing the call at the time or the question at the time was a focus on Nutritionals.
And the point I tried to make at the time and let me be clear this was in our planning and preparation for some time.
This is not some knee-jerk reaction to the last few months or years even.
We have been considering what is the appropriate long-term disposition of the company or companies for several years.
Obviously I can't speculate about that to analysts or investors on any given call.
But as you know analysts speculate to me.
So when they speculate to me publicly about for example in this case nutrition one thing I feel obligated to do sometimes is disabuse us of the notion of some path that may not be correct.
And that isn’t correct and it wasn't correct at the time.
I do think what I reflected or intended to reflect at the time was kind of the precursor to this notion of investors will appreciate the parts of the company differently.
There is a different investment identity to different parts of the company.
And I think that the notion that the different parts of the company weren't being appreciated that way or different investors weren't seeing it that way was clearly in those comments and that's probably the tone you heard.
But the answer to that which I think you see today I think is the right answer.
I don't think it's to just break things up into little pieces.
I do believe there is value in the diversified model that is Abbott.
We believe that fundamentally and I think that's been proven out over decades.
But I also note that the characteristics of the elements of that diverse model do have to have a common or complementary characteristics and balance.
And the big distinction here is it was our Proprietary Pharma business that did so well and dominated the identity of the company over time.
And not only were we out of balance but the identity of that business is very different as it evolved.
So what we ended up with is 2 very distinct successful pieces.
And the notion that nutrition was the proper piece of that was the part that I didn't agree with because it's very consistent with a lot of the characteristics of the rest of the company the growth prospects et cetera at the time it was being compared to a PE of a competitor.
Now I think all of us in this industry would love to have the PE of that competitor.
Who knows how sustainable any of these PEs are over time.
But I think that the mix as we’ve described it today is correct given our strategy as a diverse company in healthcare with a particular balance.
So I don't think this is at all inconsistent Tony with what the tone I communicated at the time.
I think it's frankly very consistent.
But at the time I couldn't say to you hey good idea but you got the wrong business that you carved out here.
That's kind of the essence of this.
That the notion at the time the question I got was more a notion of are you sure all of this mix fits together? That's how I would take it.
And the hypothesis was gee the nutrition was the one you could carve out.
I think the notion had merit.
I think the Proprietary Pharma business is the one that has the distinctly different identity and I think this makes sense today.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Miles just a quick question that's been addressed here a little bit but I want to ask it maybe in a very different way.
We believe Abbott is undervalued and the primary issue certainly does seem in the eyes of most investors to be confusion over HUMIRA.
So as I think about your current multiple it does imply real concern around HUMIRA its cash flow growth and profitability.
But you are in management is much more bullish on the potential for HUMIRA than consensus.
So I wonder why not wait to see for that to be appreciated in the market as competitive threats prove less material than those people think which is only really 2 to 3 years away? Well I think 2 things.
First of all I think that the -- this split is not about confidence around HUMIRA.
It's around the identities of the businesses as I described earlier.
I agree with you that the company is underappreciated and perhaps undervalued but I don't know any CEOs out there who wouldn't claim that their companies are undervalued.
I think the entire sector may well be undervalued.
The entire stock market could be undervalued.
It depends on your perspective for the business it depends on your perspective of the development of international markets it depends on your perspective of a lot of things.
I'd support your notion that we're undervalued.
But I think the notion of a split here it has the right merit logic given our intent regarding the investment identities of the company and what belongs in the diverse mix.
At the end of the day the questions around HUMIRA's durability will clearly be answered.
I think we will go a long way toward answering that even more thoroughly on Friday.
Rick answered a lot of it earlier in the phone call.
But I think we can respond to the durability of HUMIRA going forward.
As Rick acknowledged earlier the growth of HUMIRA continues to be very strong and continues to be in excess of about $1 billion a year.
That's equivalent of a so-called blockbuster a year here in growth.
Now granted that's not going to happen forever but there's obviously several years left of that kind of durability and growth and strength in that business and that franchise.
And I believe that with further explanation on Friday we will further lay out why we see the development of the market the biosimilars the orals et cetera as we do and investors will make their choices.
But I think we have evaluated that pretty closely and pretty carefully over the last couple of years.
We have a view.
We have a view of the durability of HUMIRA.
We'll share that with investors and I think the obvious next question an investor has is what about after HUMIRA? What then? And I think that greater visibility to the pipeline of the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business will go a long way towards filling in those gaps for analysts and investors and I think we're beginning to fill those gaps now.
But even if there were great visibility to that on the part of investors and analysts and even if there were great understanding of all of that.
By the same we would still be splitting the company because we believe there are 2 really distinct different and valuable investment identities here that make sense as 2 separate public companies.
Research Division</strong> That's very clear.
And maybe just one more strategic question.
You like a lot of healthcare CEOs have talked about the healthcare environment and what they may look like over the next 3 to 5 years.
And I guess the question is isn't size an asset in this environment and I wonder will this limit your flexibility at all? For example if your device franchise standalone needed more breadth to compete and more bundling were occur in that segment of the marketplace couldn't HUMIRA cash flow have enabled future acquisitions there? So simply is size an asset? Does this limit your flexibility at all? No I don't think it limits our flexibility at all.
You got to remember we're a very large company becoming 2 very large companies.
These are both large cap companies at the end of the day.
They're both very strong companies and they both have very strong cash flow.
The cash flow of each of these companies is equivalent to what the entire company was not that long ago.
The cash flows are very strong on both sides.
I don’t feel like either one of these 2 companies is going to be constrained or limited by what it may wish to do.
We're not actively seeking large acquisitions.
I think at least on the side of the diverse medical products company I'd tell you that I think is there is so much potential for growth and sustained double-digit margin growth that we can do that organically.
For us any acquisitions or additions to the company I think will be very much opportunistic and because there's an opportunity we believe we can uniquely leverage in the mix of our business over time.
Will there be those opportunities? I think there will be over time and we'll react to them and evaluate them as they come and we'll be able to do it opportunistically and we'll have no shortage of capital or flexibility to do it.
On the Proprietary Pharma side I think the same is true.
I think as there are pipeline opportunities for Rick to add to that business.
There is no shortage of capital flexibility to do so.
Both will have very strong cash flows.
We are not reliant as a company on HUMIRA alone.
As I indicated earlier all of these businesses are generating positive cash flow today.
And actually and if you went back 10 years ago that wasn't true.
The Diagnostics business didn't generate cash.
The Diabetes business didn't generate cash at the time.
Today they do.
All of these businesses generate strong cash flow.
So no shortage of flexibility.
Our next question is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.
Research Division</strong> I'll start with sort of pick up where you left off with David's question.
Is it too soon Miles to talk in little more detail about your preliminary vision for the ongoing Abbott.
You said you made some comments we’ll continue to expand in emerging markets.
I'd expect to hear that.
You're already a strong presence.
But you talked about channel synergies and you talked -- you highlighted the self-paid mix.
Maybe help us think here.
Where does Miles White see the company going over the next 5 years more of a consumer-oriented company is there other capital -- opportunities in capital or IT? Just any preliminary thoughts would be fabulous? Well Rick as we've talked about on previous calls the emerging markets in particular are big growth opportunity because of the expansion of those economies and the expansion of the healthcare systems in those economies.
And the structures of those markets are very different.
Not different just with each other but different than say the U.S.
Europe Japan historically.
They are much more self-pay markets than reimburse markets in general and our Established Pharmaceuticals or branded generics business and our Nutritional businesses are generally speaking in those markets self-pay businesses.
And yet growing very rapidly in those markets.
They share common outlets.
They share common distribution channels and so forth.
And while we have not at this point attempted any kind of synergy between them they do share common visibility brand outlet pharmacy wholesaler et cetera in all those markets.
And I think that footprint will definitely benefit us going forward.
I think it's a plus to have a mix of sources of how your products are paid for.
For a company in our business if you're solely dependent on the U.S.
and Europe well then you're going to be dependent on governments and payers that are highly concentrated.
And that's going to be true of the characteristics of our Proprietary Pharma business and that's been the case for a lot of our mix of business over time.
One of the things that was attractive to me about the ophthalmology business was that a big chunk of that business is consumer discretion business the LASIK business.
And while that business has been pressured by the economy in the last few years I like the fact that we're not just dependent on government reimbursement in a lot of cases for payment for our products.
Because I think for those countries those businesses those products where consumers make the decision your businesses is somewhat less vulnerable to large structural moves in the payment system.
So I think that mix is good.
I think that we will continue to expand in emerging markets because as I said earlier growth is there.
We are not ignoring developed markets.
There's a big chunk of the company both companies frankly in developed markets and those are important markets to us.
But I will tell you that I think the developed markets will be much slower growers for the future and a lot of the growth will come internationally and especially in emerging markets.
So I think that the obvious distinction that way between the pharmaceutical business and the diverse medical products business is -- the diverse medical products business has the market growth the expansion the expansion of those economies a tailwind of growth.
It's not going to be that dependent on single large products.
The pharmaceutical business will always be dependent on single large products because that's the nature of that business.
And the productivity of our R&amp;D and therefore the importance of our pipeline and the durability of products like HUMIRA very important for that business.
And I think that's why our pharmaceutical business has been so successful over the last decade and I think will continue to be going forward but those are different in different market dynamics.
Research Division</strong> Just a follow-up you highlighted the potential for improving gross margins and operating margins.
Maybe you want to talk a little bit about that.
Is that factory consolidation? Is it just realigning how products are made and where and distributed? Is that significant in your mind? And maybe just Tom when will we see you start reporting some kind of breakdown for the 2 companies differently? Will it wait until the Form 10-Q comes out? Rick I'll just say we're going to explain more about this on Friday the first question on margins.
Rick in our segment information you already have quite a bit of basis for understanding the major businesses here.
So I mean obviously we do need to go through this carve-out financial process which is going to take several months.
And that's when you'll see a little more specifically more of a fully allocated picture of the pharma business than what you see in the segment footnotes.
But you have pretty good information right now.
And I'd say as we get later into the process after we do the Form 10 and get closer to the true separation we'll be getting more granular on how these 2 businesses look.
Just to answer the granular point you put upfront on the gross margin.
There are several businesses here that are changing the structure of manufacturing and other things the sourcing and even how they go to market in some cases.
Diagnostics is having a great program underway that way and has expanded its gross margin.
Diabetes Care same.
Nutritionals major programs underway right now to change the mix of its gross margin.
Some of it is our manufacturing strategy globally.
Some of it's whether we make it ourselves versus source-it et cetera.
There are a number of factors that contribute to it.
But we will talk about it a little more on Friday.
Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> I have 2 questions.
One the Established Pharmaceuticals business I wonder if you can walk through the reasoning why that wasn't put with the pharmaceutical business? I would've expected that this could have been a nice buffer against any pipeline failures and government intervention that you mentioned so maybe comment on that? Then the second question I wonder we're all asking about timing but also -- we're now in this unusual period now where there's Health Care Reform implementation.
We've got a super committee discussing further Medicare cuts.
I wonder if this also played into the time now to do the split? Okay first comment on the Established Pharmaceuticals business and the Proprietary business.
I'll tell you other than the fact that they both have the word pharmaceutical in their headline they're really different.
Their business models are different the markets where -- that are attractive to them are different.
The Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business is very much a developed economy business for all the reasons we know.
The kinds of products that we sell and the cost of those products and so forth their affordability and so on.
Those are developed market products.
The Established Products division at least here you'll note doesn't have a U.S.
business and won't.
It is not our anticipation to be in the U.S.
because it wouldn't make money here.
And at the end of the day we are trying to earn a return on the investors' capital.
So that business will stay focused on international markets.
And then the nature of the competition and the selling frankly Glen has a lot more in common with businesses like our nutrition business than it does the Proprietary Pharma business.
It's a business about a breadth of product line and key leaders in key categories your feet on the street than relationships with many many pharmacies and wholesalers and so forth in these emerging markets.
The business model and how money is made are very very different.
And there isn't actually a lot in common there.
So it made sense to us that the Established Pharmaceutical business belonged with the other very Durable Growth business and not with the Proprietary Pharma business.
With regard to Health Care Reform I would say Health Care Reform is a contributor to the environment in general.
It clearly has impacted the environment for healthcare products.
It has impacted the environment for pharmaceuticals and/or medical device products.
Frankly so has the debt crisis and pay crisis in Europe.
The impacts on the economies in the U.S.
and Europe aging populations all the things that we know are happening to pressure the healthcare products markets in the U.S.
and Europe all contribute to a different environment.
And at the end of the day I'd say all that does is change the nature of the environment in which we compete and operate.
That's going to clearly have an impact on all the businesses not just pharma.
This is not motivated solely by Health Care Reform at all.
But the Health Care Reform you could say is a contributor to the overall environment that has contributed to a bigger consideration about the investment identities of these 2 businesses.
Our next question is from Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to probe a little bit on the pharmaceutical business if I could.
I know I for one have been looking for more and more disclosure on your pipeline.
And I guess we'll get that on Friday.
But I know you have a high level of optimism about the outlook for that business and I am anxious to hear the details.
But clearly some of the assets like hepatitis and MS are very much changing quickly in terms of standard of care and have a lot of intense competition.
So there is let's just say there is some risk in terms of the pipeline of that particular Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business.
How are you thinking about that in regards to business development? And if you could comment about the cash flow outlook I think that you're sort of implying HUMIRA will probably grow another $1 billion per year for I would say a couple of years.
I don't know if that would mean a couple means 2 or 3 to me.
But at the same time you're losing the lipids franchise.
So there's -- where are we in the adequacy of the cash flow for business development? Because I'm sure you want to make sure that there's some cushions and buffer in the outlook for the pipeline given the competitive dynamics in some of the key franchises in the late stage.
And given obviously longer-term acknowledgment of some risks on HUMIRA.
That's a mouthful I appreciate that.
It was a long question.
A big part of that we're going to answer on Friday.
I would tell you we understand the competitive dynamics pretty well in hepatitis as well as MS and I think we can walk through that on Friday.
I'd also tell you just don't focus on hepatitis and MS.
Bardoxolone is a big asset.
We have a number of other assets that we'll talk to you about.
But clearly the areas we're going into are areas of high unmet clinical needs.
They're competitive okay.
I think we understand the profile that we need.
HUMIRA I think you described -- you’ve described it in a way that's consistent with what we think although I would say I have view that's different than you about sustainability.
And that is the key to this right? We believe there's strong underlying growth that will be maintained for a longer period of time.
We believe there's plenty opportunity to penetrate these markets.
And on top of that the pipeline will play out.
There certainly will be a period where the generic impact on our dyslipidemia franchise will depress overall growth rates but the underlying growth rate will be very very strong.
And so when that plays through you'll see it pop back up to very healthy growth.
Our final question is from Barbara Ryan from Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Most of them have been asked but I'm just wondering I think you answered why you separated emerging established products from the Proprietary business because of the risk profile and the cash flow characteristics and persistency make it fit more with the medical products business.
But I'm just wondering when you acquired those businesses you did talk about the opportunity to cross-sell the 2 companies' products I'm just wondering if there's any dis-synergies associated with separating those 2? I know you talked about that they have been separated largely internally.
And if there's a plan to commercializing some of your proprietary products in those emerging markets that are dominated by these established products and then I have another question? It's interesting.
I don't expect the synergies and the companies will in some cases still maintain common brands in some examples where the EPD business will have a brand overseas in some markets and the Proprietary business will have it in the U.S.
or some others.
That's not uncommon.
As you know products like Enbrel or Remicade and others have had 2 companies marketing them in different markets over time.
So I think that some of the things that some might assume would be dis-synergies or conflicts won't be and it won't be for us.
So I don't see that there's an issue there.
The notion of cross-selling and shared.
The company is frankly where it makes sense can cooperate.
We're not going to be in any kind of direct competition any way we aren't now.
So I think that -- I don't think there's any threat to the original comment.
Although clearly Barbara neither necessarily relies on that for its success.
I think both can be completely independently successful without reliance on the other even if there are some shared assets.
Rick you want to add anything to that? No.
I mean I think that covers it.
I mean clearly emerging markets aren't as significant for the Proprietary business as they are for the other business.
But they are a significant contributor to our growth in certain emerging markets where you have reimbursement access.
That's the key for the proprietary product.
I think that's an important point.
The Proprietary business will also have opportunities in the emerging markets and we'll definitely go after those opportunities.
They have presence there now they have people there now and there's market there now albeit smaller in terms of numbers of people or whatever but sizable in terms of dollars for some of the places that Rick mentioned.
So Barbara you had one more question? Research Division</strong> Yes.
The question really is about the outlook.
You made this very specific comments about the growth outlook both for top and bottom line in the medical products business.
You spoke to sort of competitive low single-digit top line growth for Proprietary business but you didn't comment on earnings.
And I'm just wondering given the fact that the company has been diversified and along with that your investor base is looking for persistency and consistency and double-digit earnings growth whether there is likely to be any change in the investment profile of the Proprietary business i.e.
do you see opportunities to spend more on that business that you were reluctant to do and maybe believe you should be doing that you were married to a business with different kinds of expectations? I think if you look at the investment identity of pharmaceuticals within Abbott I would say that the way we plan the way we run businesses within Abbott it's -- although we're all part of a big family the reality is we build our own P&amp;Ls our plans by year and we try to invest in a way that's appropriate for the right return for the investor.
And so I can tell you without question that the pharmaceutical business was never underfunded on programs that they believe that they could advance more rapidly.
Now it depends a lot on the evolution of your pipeline.
As you get more and more of your pipeline in Phase III it's far more expensive to be able to develop those products.
But whether we were inside of Abbott or outside of Abbott that would be the same investment profile that will drive the business in order to maximize the return on that investment going forward.
Barbara I think you'll see eventually here in the split of the companies in their P&amp;Ls and balance sheets and so forth a profile in the Proprietary Pharma business is pretty healthy a profit profile and a spending profile is pretty healthy.
Its R&amp;D spending compares well.
Its SG&amp;A spending compares well particularly given the focus of its business in specialty categories.
I agree with what Rick said.
It's not in any way been underfunded or had to subsidize anything else.
When you look at the whole Abbott Laboratories and you look at the profiles of R&amp;D spending or profits and so forth there's a dilution that occurs there in the mix of all of that that makes it difficult to see the individual profiles of businesses.
The R&amp;D intensity of Nutritionals business by comparison is low-single digits.
It's not necessarily to spend nor does it take more.
And when you marry the size of the sales of a business with a lower profile where your spending is much higher in SG&amp;A than it is on R&amp;D and so forth and you look at the combined total I think you could question that.
But as you see the Proprietary business broken out I think what you'll see is a very healthy profile that in no way constrains it.
And I think you'll see proper profiles that are competitive and the other businesses as well on the other side.
That concludes our conference call today.
As I mentioned earlier we did post a 12-page slide deck to our Abbott Investor website that summarizes today's announcement about the separation into 2 publicly-traded independent companies.
I also mentioned if you joined us late in the call that we are hosting an investor meeting this Friday October 21 in New York from 9:00 a.m.
to 11:00 a.m.
where we'll discuss the growth opportunities in each of these businesses in more detail and answer some of the questions that came up today as well.
Miles Rick Tom and Dr.
John Leonard who I mentioned is our Head of R&amp;D for Pharma will be in attendance along with Larry and me and some other folks.
Additionally if you listened to a replay or if you'd like to listen to a replay of our conference call today after 11:00 a.m.
Central Time it will be available on our Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com and after 11:00 a.m.
Central Time via telephone at (203) 369-3519 confirmation code 2128756.
The audio replay will be available until 4:00 p.m.
on Wednesday November 2.
So thank you all for joining this morning.
We look forward to seeing hopefully many of you in New York on Friday or in the coming weeks and months as we talk to you individually about this transaction and the growth opportunities going forward.
Have a good day.
Thank you.
And this concludes today's conference.
You may disconnect at this time.
Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.
With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr.
John Thomas Vice President Investor Relations and Public Affairs.
Thank you.
Good morning and thanks for joining us everybody.
Also on today's call will be Miles White our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Larry Peepo Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations.
Miles will provide his opening remarks and Tom will review the details of our fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for 2012.
I'll then discuss the highlights of our major businesses.
Following our comments Miles Tom Larry and I will take your questions.
Some statements made today may be forward-looking including the planned separation of a research-based pharmaceutical company from the diversified medical products company and the expected financial results of the 2 companies after the separation.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2010 and are incorporated by reference.
We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments.
In today's conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
And so with that I'll turn the call over to Miles.
Miles? Okay.
Thanks John.
Good morning.
This morning I'll review our 2011 performance as well as our outlook for 2012 and Tom and John will walk you through the details of our fourth quarter and our full year results as well as our 2012 outlook and then we'll take your questions.
As you can see from our earnings news release Abbott reported another year of strong performance in 2011 despite what's been another challenging year for the healthcare industry and for the global economy.
We managed through these challenges as we've always done and delivered full year ongoing EPS growth of nearly 12%.
And as we announced this morning we expect to deliver another year of strong performance as we issued guidance of $4.95 per share to $5.05 per share for 2012.
I'll talk more about the year ahead in a moment.
In 2011 Abbott sales grew more than 10% driven by double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals International and Nutritionals Molecular and Point of Care Diagnostics International Vascular and Global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals.
HUMIRA had another outstanding year and with nearly $8 billion in sales solidifying its global position as the anti-TNF market leader.
In addition to full year double-digit sales growth as forecasted we improved the profitability of many of our operating businesses and in the fourth quarter we delivered an adjusted gross margin ratio of nearly 64%.
We also generated more than $9 billion of operating cash flow which was another record year.
And we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends.
Our payout ratio is strong at more than 40%.
We've increased our dividend for 39 consecutive years making Abbott one of only a handful of U.S.
companies to deliver with such consistency.
Our return of cash to shareholders through dividends together with Abbott's stock price appreciation generated a total shareholder return of nearly 22% in 2011 compared to 2% for the S&amp;P 500 over the same period of time.
This level of performance led all large-cap medical device companies and was also near the top of large-cap pharmaceutical companies.
Abbott's performance in 2011 is our best annual return in 5 years and our second-best performance in 10 years.
Abbott's 5-year total return of nearly 35% was more than double the S&amp;P Healthcare Index.
Over the same time period the S&amp;P 500 Index declined 1%.
To continue to generate value for our shareholders and align Abbott's long-term strategic goals with shareholders' best interest we announced in October our intention to separate Abbott into 2 leading healthcare companies one in diversified medical products and the other in research-based pharmaceuticals.
Creating 2 independent companies provides 2 unique and compelling investment opportunities for shareholders as the investment identities and operating models of each business have evolved independently over the last several years.
Both enterprises will be well-positioned large-cap investment opportunities in their respective peer groups.
They'll also have broad product portfolios and global presence strong balance sheets significant and durable cash flows and are expected to have strong investment-grade credit ratings.
As we've said each will generate a dividend that when combined will equally Abbott dividend at the time of separation.
And as you can see from our earnings news release this morning both businesses performed well again in 2011.
After we announced the separation in October we immediately brought our transition organization together.
This is the same organization that executed the separation of our hospital products business and successfully integrated our key acquisitions including Knoll Guidant and Solvay.
Right now we're working through the many details of separating the 2 organizations.
This has been simplified in large part by completing the separation of our Established Pharmaceuticals business at the beginning of last year.
But as you can imagine there's still a significant amount of work to do.
The transition team has developed and is implementing detailed plans to prepare for the separation.
Moving onto our 2011 results.
I'll start with the diversified medical products businesses which is comprised of 4 similarly-sized segments: Established Pharmaceuticals Nutritionals Diagnostics and Medical Devices.
In our Established Pharmaceuticals division which is our branded generics business we delivered sales of $5.4 billion in 2011 an increase of nearly 20%.
We spent the better part of the last decade building EPD into the global organization it is today.
Most recently we completed the integration of Piramal Healthcare Solutions in 2011 which together with our existing business made Abbott the largest pharmaceutical company in India one of several rapidly growing emerging markets.
The success of EPD is built on literally hundreds of different products sold around the globe.
Our global Nutrition business delivered more than 8% growth for the full year 2011.
In the U.S.
we regained all the share we had lost due to the late 2010 infant formula recall and reestablished our position as the infant formula market leader with Similac.
We also continued to drive double-digit growth of our toddler brand Pediasure.
International sales increased 14% for the full year as we continue to drive growth in fast-growing emerging markets.
At $2.5 billion our emerging market Nutritional sales comprised more than 40% of our total Nutritional business and increased 17% for the full year.
As I discussed in our investor meeting in October one of our key priorities in our Nutrition business is to expand its operating margin.
Similar to the success that we've seen in Diagnostics and Diabetes Care we're implementing an improvement plan to drive our nutrition margin from the low teens in 2011 to our target of more than 20% by 2015.
We began to see progress from our efforts in the fourth quarter.
While quite detailed this plan has 4 main drivers of improvement: manufacturing locations and processes; materials and packaging costs; distribution; and product and geographic mix.
Let me give you a few examples.
We're building plants in key emerging markets including China to be closer to the customer as well as reduce manufacturing and shipping costs.
We'll be online with new facilities in 2013.
We're moving from a distributor model to a direct model in certain countries which we expect to generate significant savings.
And we're improving both our product and geographic mix and in some cases exiting product lines or markets to focus on more profitable opportunities.
These are just a few examples of many initiatives that are underway in the nutrition business.
We expect to see good progress in 2012 with much more significant improvement in operating margin in 2013 and beyond.
Moving on to Diagnostics which had another impressive year in terms of both sales and margin.
Sales increased 9% with continued double-digit growth in both Molecular and Point of Care.
We delivered strong growth in emerging markets such as China where in Core Laboratory Diagnostics for example we continue to place new ARCHITECT systems.
In 2011 across Diagnostics we launched a number of new devices and tests including our wireless i-STAT point of care device a Vitamin D assay on ARCHITECT and a new molecular diagnostic that's used with a new lung cancer treatment.
We expect approximately 20 new product launches in 2012.
Diagnostics continued its successful multiyear operating margin improvement plan.
2011 was a record year for margin dollar contribution up more than 35% resulting in an operating margin of more than 18%.
In 2012 we'll continue to expand the margin profile of our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business while we drive more significant contribution from our Molecular and Point of Care businesses.
By 2015 Diagnostics should deliver more than $1 billion in margin annually reflecting an operating margin that we expect will be more than 20%.
And finally our Medical Devices segment which includes Vascular Diabetes Care and Vision Care.
In Diabetes Care in 2011 we launched our new InsuLinx glucose monitor in Europe.
This technology is the foundation for our new product pipeline as we improve the testing experience for insulin-dependent patients.
Both the gross and operating margins in our diabetes business continue to improve.
In Vision Care we launched 5 new products in 2011 including the European launch of our new TECNIS Toric intraocular lens for cataract patients.
Our Vision Care pipeline is balanced across our LASIK cataract and eye care solutions business lines with numerous products launching over the next 5 years.
And in Vascular we launched several important new products in 2011 that solidified our position as the #1 vascular device company globally.
In the U.S.
we launched our XIENCE nano small-vessel drug-eluting stent and in November launched XIENCE PRIME our next-generation DES that's also approved for long lesions.
Both of these products have allowed Abbott to expand into market segments where we weren't previously competing to capture additional share.
In Europe we received CE Mark for our bioresorbable vascular scaffold or BVS ABSORB and we expect a full commercial launch by the end of this year.
We delivered high single-digit growth in our endovascular segment which includes our carotid stents vessel closure devices and peripheral balloons and stents.
Our endovascular business is approaching $500 million in annual sales and we expect double-digit growth in 2012.
In 2011 we also saw continued gains from our new TREK balloon franchise delivering 20% growth for coronary balloons for the full year.
We also continue to perform well in emerging markets.
This geographic segment comprises nearly 20% of total vascular sales and increased 25% for the full year.
In addition to our endovascular business we expect numerous new product launches to drive growth over the next several years.
This includes ABSORB as I mentioned; our U.S.
launch of MitraClip for mitral regurgitation; our recently announced new drug-eluting stent system XIENCE XPEDITION which we anticipate launching in Europe in the second half of this year; as well as numerous coronary and endovascular products in our pipeline.
In our Proprietary Pharmaceutical business we delivered another year of industry-leading performance.
HUMIRA our biologic for the treatment of autoimmune diseases continued to exceed our expectations delivering strong growth again in 2011.
With its broad range of indications strong global market position and well-established safety and efficacy profile it will continue to be a strong and sustainable growth product going forward.
Beyond HUMIRA we delivered strong growth with many of our durable specialty-focused products.
This included double-digit growth for the full year 2011 in the U.S.
for Lupron Synthroid CREON and AndroGel.
In our pharmaceutical pipeline we advanced 2 products into Phase III development and now have more than 20 compounds or new indications in Phase II or Phase III.
I'd like to focus on just a couple in particular.
As we discussed in October we've made significant progress on our pipeline over the past several years augmenting it with promising late-stage assets and successfully advancing internal programs.
One of these internal programs is HCV where our data to date have shown that we're in the running to have a leadership position in this category by effectively curing HCV with a short course of therapy without interferon.
We'll present additional HCV data this spring and more importantly initial results from our Phase IIb program in the fall.
Another late-stage compound I'd highlight is bardoxolone which is in Phase III for chronic kidney disease.
Bardoxolone has the potential to prevent and possibly reverse the progression of CKD.
To date no treatment has been shown to reverse disease progression.
Bardoxolone could change the treatment landscape as well as have a significant economic benefit to the healthcare system.
We're developing this compound with our partner Reata and recently expanded that agreement to jointly develop and commercialize their entire portfolio of next-generation anti-inflammatory treatments across a number of diseases including RA MS and COPD.
So in summary as we look back on 2011 it was really another outstanding year for Abbott.
We delivered ongoing EPS growth of nearly 12% and generated a total shareholder return of nearly 22%.
As we look forward to 2012 we expect to deliver another year of strong earnings growth while investing appropriately to ensure successful futures for our 2 leading healthcare companies post separation.
Each has its own unique and compelling investment identity and both are well-positioned in their respective markets.
We expect Abbott to be one of the fastest-growing large-cap diversified medical products companies with a durable mix of products and a strong emerging markets presence.
The new research-based pharmaceutical company will be a leader in its industry with a strong and sustainable portfolio of biologics and specialty medicines and a promising pipeline.
We believe both of these companies will be attractive opportunities for investors.
With that I'll turn it over to Tom and John for a more detailed overview of the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2012.
Tom? Thanks Miles.
We're very pleased with how we ended 2011 as we had a strong fourth quarter delivering double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth.
And we had strong overall performance in 2011 with ongoing EPS above the original guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year.
For the fourth quarter we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.45 an increase of 11.5% over the prior year.
For the full year 2011 ongoing EPS was up 11.8%.
Sales growth in the quarter was 4.1% including a favorable 0.2% impact from exchange rates.
With the significant movement in a number of currencies during the quarter impact from exchange was almost 1% less favorable than we had forecasted on the third quarter call.
We continue to see the benefit of our strategies to expand in the emerging markets with total emerging market sales across the company of $2.5 billion representing nearly 25% of total sales with particularly strong growth in Nutritionals Vascular and Diagnostics in the quarter.
The adjusted gross margin ratio was 63.8% up 320 basis points from the prior year.
While changes in exchange rates contributed roughly half of the improvement over 2010 we did see significantly better operating performance across most of our businesses including Vascular Pharmaceuticals Nutritionals Diabetes Care and Diagnostics.
Overall as we look at 2011 we delivered strong ongoing EPS growth despite a number of factors that impacted our industry.
We continued to expand our presence across emerging markets advanced our late-stage pipeline and made great strides to improve the overall efficiency of the company while continuing to invest in the business to drive future growth.
And we generated record operating cash flow of more than $9 billion in 2011.
Most importantly we announced our plan to separate into 2 leading healthcare companies each with a unique investment identity.
Looking ahead to 2012 as Miles mentioned the separation is on track for completion by the end of the year.
So the guidance we provided today reflects a full year outlook for the company in total.
Today we issued a full year ongoing earnings per share guidance of $4.95 to $5.05 reflecting another year of strong performance.
Regarding sales growth for 2012 with the recent movements in various exchange rates we'd expect there to be a sales headwind this year.
Current rates would result in a negative impact of exchange on sales of approximately 2.5% in 2012.
Our operational sales growth in 2012 is expected to be in the mid single digits.
However if current rates were to hold the negative impact from exchange would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits this year.
Our sales forecast reflects an expectation for somewhat slower growth in our Proprietary Pharmaceutical business offset by stronger growth in the remainder of the Medical Device and Nutritional businesses.
Our outlook for Proprietary Pharmaceutical reflects ongoing trends in our U.S.
lipids franchise including a continued decline in Niaspan and an expectation for generic competition for TriCor in the second half of the year.
Also for 2012 we're forecasting continued improvement in our adjusted full year gross margin ratio which is expected to approach 62% for the full year.
This reflects efficiency initiatives favorable mix and current exchange rates partially offset by the decline in U.S.
lipid sales.
We're forecasting continuing strong investments to drive long-term growth in 2012 and after the separation for both companies with R&amp;D of 9.5% to 10% of sales and SG&amp;A of somewhat under 28% of sales.
Overall we expect to expand our operating margin ratio by around 100 basis points in 2012.
We're forecasting net interest expense of around $450 million in 2012.
We saw great progress in improving liquidity through the buildup of cash and by paying down short-term debt in 2011.
But since both short-term investments and long-term debt are at such low interest rates there's little expected change to net interest expense in 2012 from the amount seen in 2011.
Regarding the tax rate in 2012 we expect a rate of 14.5% to 15%.
We're forecasting quarterly ongoing EPS growth in each of the quarters that's consistent with the growth implied by our full year EPS guidance range.
Our operational sales growth in the first quarter is expected to be in the mid single digits.
However at current exchange rates we would see a roughly 2% negative impact from exchange in the first quarter which will result in reported sales growth in the low single digits.
We're forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 61% in the first quarter up over the first quarter of 2011.
And finally in 2012 we're planning to resume share repurchases.
So in summary we exceeded our key financial goals in 2011 including strong EPS growth and cash flow generation while continuing to take strategic action to shape Abbott for the long term.
Our outlook for 2012 again reflects strong performance as we execute the steps necessary to separate Abbott into 2 leading healthcare companies by the end of this year.
With that let's turn to the business operating highlights.
John? Thanks Tom.
This morning I'll review the fourth quarter performance for 2011 and the 2012 outlook for our major business categories.
I'll also provide a brief overview of our pipeline and the major milestones we expect this year.
I'll describe our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results on a reported basis that is including the impact of foreign exchange.
For our 2012 division outlook when I get there and given recent FX trends I'll provide both operational and reported expectations.
So let me start with our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business where our worldwide reported sales in the fourth quarter increased nearly 7%.
For the full year 2011 worldwide reported sales in pharmaceuticals increased 11%.
Global demand for HUMIRA continues to outpace the market with reported sales up nearly 16% in the fourth quarter.
Performance was driven by strong U.S.
sales growth consistent with underlying trends in the quarter.
We continue to see steady market growth globally including strong performance for HUMIRA in the gastroenterology and dermatology segments.
International HUMIRA growth in the quarter was impacted by our previous change to calendar year reporting for our international operations.
Therefore adjusting for results on a calendar year basis HUMIRA international sales would have increased approximately 15% in the fourth quarter on a reported basis.
Full year 2011 recorded sales for HUMIRA increased 21% globally ahead of our original outlook at this time last year which was low teens growth.
As we look ahead to 2012 we expect low double-digit reported sales growth for HUMIRA worldwide which includes the negative expected impact of foreign exchange.
Global reported sales of CREON in the quarter were approximately $175 million up approximately 13%.
Full year 2011 global reported sales were approximately $630 million and that was up 45%.
CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market.
And over the past year we've captured the vast majority of new prescription starts in this category.
U.S.
sales of Lupron in the quarter were up 7%.
Full year global Lupron sales were $810 million and that was ahead of our expectations.
Our recently approved 6-month formulation of Lupron Depot continues to perform well driving share gains and further expanding our category leadership.
And U.S.
sales of Synthroid were approximately $135 million in the quarter.
Full year sales were approximately $520 million and that was up more than 15%.
For 2012 we expect U.S.
Synthroid sales of more than $500 million.
Moving on to AndroGel where U.S.
sales in the fourth quarter were approximately $260 million up nearly 20%.
Full year 2011 sales were approximately $875 million an increase of nearly 35%.
AndroGel holds the #1 share position in the testosterone replacement market where growth is being driven by increasing diagnostics and treatment of low testosterone.
Our new low-volume formulation is the fastest growing therapy in the market and has quickly gained market share.
So for 2012 we expect continued double-digit growth for AndroGel.
Moving on to our more mature lipid franchise where sales of Niospan were $258 million in the quarter down 10% with prescription growth slowing following the discontinuation of the AIM-HIGH trial in May as we previously discussed.
Global TRILIPIX/TriCor reported sales in the quarter were down approximately 4% reflecting ongoing impact from the ACCORD study and continued softness in the overall cholesterol market.
In terms of our 2012 outlook for our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business we contemplated the current dynamics of the total cholesterol market prescription trends for our range of lipid products including TriCor TRILIPIX and Niaspan and the entry of generic TriCor in the second half of the year.
As a result we expect low single-digit reported sales growth for the global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business including roughly flat performance in the U.S.
and low single-digit reported growth in the international business.
On an operational or performance basis excluding the impact on the foreign exchange we expect international Proprietary Pharmaceutical sales growth of mid to high single digits.
Moving onto our Established Pharmaceuticals division or EPD which includes international sales of our branded generics portfolio.
Fourth quarter reported global sales were nearly $1.4 billion.
Excluding the impact of timing related to a significant tender for vaccine sales that occurred in the third quarter of 2011 rather than the fourth quarter sales in our Established Pharmaceuticals business increased approximately 3% in the fourth quarter.
In 2011 we received approximately 250 product approvals across numerous countries.
And over the next several years we expect more than 1 000 product launches in EPD including registrations across multiple geographies to help drive continued durable performance in this business.
So for 2012 we expect mid single-digit operational sales growth in our Established Pharmaceuticals division including continued double-digit growth in key emerging markets with strong bottom line growth.
However since this business consists entirely of international sales we expect reported sales growth to be roughly flat including a mid single-digit negative sales impact from foreign exchange.
Turning to our worldwide Nutritionals business where global reported sales increased approximately 8.5% in the fourth quarter driven by mi -single-digit sales growth in the U.S.
and double-digit growth internationally.
Full year 2011 global sales were more than $6 billion in this division an increase of more than 8%.
Over the course of the past year we've advanced several strategic objectives in our Nutritionals business.
In the United States Abbott Nutrition continues to maintain its strong market position in both infant formula as well as adult nutritionals.
In addition to regaining significant U.S.
infant formula market share in 2011 as Miles mentioned we drove double-digit growth in Pediasure our toddler brand and Ensure our top-selling adult nutritional product.
Internationally in our Nutritional business we successfully completed approximately 50 new product launches in key countries around the world.
And also as Miles mention we continued to deliver strong double-digit growth for our Nutrition business in emerging markets as well as drive meaningful operating margin expansion.
As we look ahead to the full year 2012 in our global Nutritionals business we're forecasting high single-digit reported sales growth including mid single-digit growth in our U.S.
business and low double-digit reported growth for our international business which includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1%.
In our global Diabetes Care business worldwide reported sales increased 4% in the quarter.
U.S.
sales were up more than 7% as we continue to grow our retail prescription share through expanded consumer outreach and patient education.
In 2011 we launched our new FreeStyle InsuLinx blood glucose monitor in Canada as well as several European countries and expect to launch it in additional markets this year.
In addition in 2011 we significantly improved the profitability of our diabetes business increasing operating margin by more than 300 basis points as a result of favorable product mix and operating cost reductions.
And we expect continued margin improvement throughout 2012.
So as we look ahead to 2012 in our global diabetes business we expect flat to low single-digit reported revenue growth including an estimated impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2.5%.
In our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business which includes immunoassay blood screening and hematology global reported sales in the quarter increased nearly 6% with U.S.
sales up 10% driven by continued strong growth of our ARCHITECT and PRISM systems.
Full year sales were nearly $3.4 billion and we continue to deliver strong margin improvement.
In our Point of Care business reported global sales in the fourth quarter increased nearly 8%.
Full year global sales were up more than 10% in 2011 driven by strong growth of our bedside cardiac tests and continued expansion in emerging markets such as China.
And in Molecular Diagnostics reported global sales increased more than 10% in the fourth quarter driven by double-digit sales growth in both the U.S.
and international markets.
Full year global sales were up nearly 15% in 2011 including more than 20% reported international sales growth.
We've seen strong uptake of our ALK companion diagnostic to a new non-small cell lung cancer medicine.
And we continue to place new systems and expand the menu of tests offered on the PLEX-ID System.
So as we look ahead for the full year 2012 we expect our worldwide Diagnostics business and that includes our Core Laboratory Point of Care and Molecular businesses to generate mid single-digit reported sales growth including an estimated negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 2.5%.
Moving onto our Vision Care business where worldwide reported sales in the fourth quarter increased approximately 2% and more than 4% for the full year 2011.
Internationally we've seen good uptake of our new TECNIS Toric IOL in Europe and strong double-digit growth in emerging markets such as China and India.
For 2012 we expect low to mid single-digit reported sales growth in our Vision Care business including an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2%.
And finally in our Vascular business worldwide sales in the fourth quarter were $826 million.
Sales were roughly flat on a reported basis.
However excluding noncommercial revenues sales increased mid single digits for the fourth quarter.
As a reminder the third-party distributor of PROMUS is now transitioning away from this product as we approach the end of our distribution agreement with them this year.
International Vascular sales which now comprise more than half of our total Vascular business increased 7% in the quarter.
In emerging markets which comprised nearly 20% of this business increased more than 14% in the quarter.
In our coronary stent business the U.S.
launches last year of XIENCE nano in May followed by XIENCE PRIME in November contributed to DES franchise revenues of approximately $480 million in the fourth quarter.
XIENCE sales increased nearly 10% globally offset by a double-digit decline in PROMUS revenues as expected.
With the recent U.S.
launches of nano and PRIME and continued strong performance in Japan China and other key international markets XIENCE has solidified its position as the #1 drug-eluting stent family globally.
XIENCE PRIME is the only everolimus drug-eluting stent available in long lengths in the U.S.
which is helping us to continue to gain share at a higher price point.
Our endovascular other coronary and structural heart businesses comprised 40% of Vascular sales and they increased mid single digits in the fourth quarter led by continued strong growth of MitraClip which posted sales in the fourth quarter of more than $25 million.
Also it was driven by growth in coronary balloons with the launch of TREK as well as growth in endovascular driven by our new Armada line of peripheral balloons and our renal stent Herculink Elite.
So as we look ahead to 2012 for Abbott Vascular we expect roughly flat global reported sales growth including our assumptions for PROMUS and nearly 2% of negative foreign exchange offset by continued strong performance from our underlying business.
The PROMUS transition will be nearly completed by the end of 2012 positioning 2013 for a stronger reported growth rate.
And now turning to our pipeline.
Since Miles spent time this morning discussing a number of compounds and technologies in our portfolio let me spend a few moments outlining some of the milestones we expect that will occur this year in 2012.
We've taken significant strategic actions to strengthen and advance our pipeline and we expect a good deal of activity throughout this year including new regulatory filings and product approvals clinical trial advancement and data presentations.
Starting with Diagnostics.
We expect regulatory filings and approvals for a number of new assays for our ARCHITECT platform.
We also expect the worldwide launch of a Web-based informatics platform called OneLab designed to connect all of the labs’ information into one easy-to-use system.
OneLab was released in Europe and Australia this month and is expected to launch in the U.S.
and Canada later this year.
In Molecular Diagnostics we expect CE Mark for a number of infectious disease tests for our m2000 system.
In addition we'll launch our ALK companion diagnostic in more than 50 additional countries following U.S.
approval last year.
In our Nutrition business we expect nearly 70 innovations globally in our adult and pediatric business lines in 2012.
In our Vascular business the productivity of our pipeline is resulting in multiple new coronary and endovascular product launches across every major geography this year.
Some of these include: our continued rollout of XIENCE PRIME including geographic expansion into Japan and China in the first half of 2012; the launch of XIENCE XPEDITION in Europe which offers a new catheter for enhanced deliverability as well as a broader-size matrix; 2 stents for iliac indications in the U.S.
Absolute Pro and Omnilink Elite; and a full commercial launch by the end of this year in Europe and a number of other countries around the world of ABSORB our bioresorbable vascular scaffold.
We're finalizing the ABSORB U.S.
trial design and expect to begin enrollment in the first half of this year with our Japan registration trial beginning in the second half of this year.
We also continue our ongoing dialogue with the FDA on the U.S.
review of MitraClip.
In AMO we expect European launches for a number of products and we plan to submit our U.S.
PMA for the TECNIS Toric intraocular lens.
And then finally in Propriety Pharmaceuticals 2012 promises to be a pretty significant year for our HCV program with results from our initial interferon-free trials presented at a spring conference and preliminary data from several Phase IIb studies in the fall.
We have a high level of confidence that our HCV compounds in development can dramatically change the treatment landscape.
We plan to present additional data analysis from our Phase IIb study of bardoxolone this year as well for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.
The Phase III program is enrolling very well and we continue to expect results from that trial later next year.
Also in development for CKD is atrasentan.
We expect to complete our ongoing Phase IIb study in diabetic patients this year and plan to initiate the Phase III program next year in 2013.
We expect to present Phase II data from ABT-126 our NNR in development for Alzheimer's and other conditions this year as well likely at a medical meeting this summer.
We're working with regulatory authorities to finalize the Phase III study on elagolix for endometriosis and expect to initiate the global trial in the coming months.
We plan to present Phase III pivotal data for Duodopa an intestinal gel for advanced Parkinson's disease at an upcoming medical meeting.
We expect to submit our U.S.
regulatory application for Duodopa later this year as well.
And finally certainly the most important milestone for 2012 will be the separation into 2 companies.
As Miles mentioned we expect significant activity leading up to the separation as we disclose additional detail and meet with existing and potential new investors throughout the coming year.
So in summary in 2011 Abbott demonstrated strength through its sales and earnings growth and reported financial results generating total shareholder return as Miles mentioned of approximately 22%.
We delivered gross margin expansion and significant profitability improvements in many of our major business segments as well as another record year of cash flow and dividends.
As we move into 2012 we look forward to delivering another year of strong growth as we prepare to separate into 2 leading healthcare companies with unique investment identities.
With that now Hélène we will take questions from the analysts.
[Operator Instructions] First question today is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.
Research Division</strong> Let me start with gross margin; outstanding.
I guess I'd ask Tom.
What took so long to get here? It's such a major leap forward.
Can you talk about a couple of points? Are the efficiency initiatives completed? What more is there to be done? How sustainable is this? And maybe just help us understand a little better why maybe the sequential dip in first quarter and why it ramps through 2012? Sure.
Well we've been talking a long time about a number -- really the focus of the entire company and every single business on improving gross margin.
And as we've also talked about over the last couple years it's -- our progress our underlying progress has really been masked by some of the pricing pressures in pharma through healthcare reforms and austerity in Europe as well as an occasional generic issue.
And what's really been going on in the business has really been quite good.
And I think this quarter as we moved into the fourth you're really starting to see the benefits of that play through.
And we do expect this to continue into next year.
For 2011 we finished with an ongoing gross margin a little under 61%.
And as I indicated in my remarks we should be approaching 62% next year and that's despite the effect of TriCor and the slowdown of Niaspan.
So as we talk about the operating margins in the business and when you see those operating margins in the 10-K when we file it in a few weeks you're going to see that most of the businesses are making very nice progress and we expect it to continue longer-term.
So we do expect this improvement of at least one point next year overall despite the headwinds.
And we expect continuing improvement beyond 2012 because every division is focused on it every plan.
And including for example the program Miles went through in nutrition has pretty detailed plans on how to get there and we're very focused on executing it.
Research Division</strong> Second question let me turn to the stent business if I could.
It's sort of half-related to the margin question.
As promised volume declines.
Can you talk a little bit about how you keep margins whole? Is it all through the uptick of the new products and XIENCE PRIME? And maybe any just broader perspective about your view of the market outlook for 2012 and growth and pricing pressures and how you’re -- what you've dialed into your numbers.
Well overall I mean obviously we are offsetting the PROMUS effect with product mix improvements and really business mix improvements.
And so just like the other headwinds when you net it all out we are showing an overall improvement.
In terms of the overall environment clearly in particular the pharma business went through the austerity period in Europe and the U.S.
healthcare reform.
But we've seen a bit of a more stable outlook for 2012.
Certainly we’ve factored in some degree of adjustments in our forecast.
But I think 2010 and 2011 were a bit of a step function and we expect that aspect of pricing et cetera to be a little more normal in 2012.
Yes.
So Rick we would expect -- as you know price declines have moderated so from year-over-year high single-digit declines which we saw last year it's more in the mid single-digit range which is encouraging.
And in addition to what Tom said we would obviously expect to pick up a lot of that business with XIENCE PRIME which we continue to sell and market in the U.S.
and outside the U.S.
And now that we have nano and PRIME we have the full complement of ranges and sizes and lengths that's not always available with some of the other competitors.
And that's one of the reasons why we've done so well internationally.
We keep talking about the fact that this business has grown to more than 50% internationally where double-digit growth is the norm in a lot of these key emerging markets for us as well as some other more developed Western Europe countries as well where we continue to take share with PRIME.
So I think those things plus the MitraClip x U.S.
run rate is now at roughly $100 million on an annual basis and that's helping as well.
Rick I'd say one last thing.
Clearly as PROMUS pulls out of the market and really if we're going to have 2 independent products as opposed to the same product that is going to bring a better dynamic to the DES market for us.
Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.
Research Division</strong> Miles let me ask you I guess the tough question first.
Going back a year ago on the fourth quarter of '10 call someone had asked you about 2012 which was setting up to be a difficult year and whether you thought sustaining 10% EPS growth was still achievable.
And you had commented at that time that that was still your goal.
And then someone asked you at the October analyst meeting on the spin announcement whether the double-digit EPS goal was still an appropriate target.
And your answer at that point in time was yes you thought that was still an appropriate goal.
But then today's guidance is 6% to 8% EPS growth for 2012.
So can you comment on that? And has anything in your view changed that makes 6% to 8% the appropriate target for this year versus the 10-plus percent before? Yes I think that's a pretty simple answer.
I think everybody is aware the single biggest thing that's changed is exchange.
There's been a pretty big shift in currency in the last 3 to 4 months here.
And that's the single biggest part of any change in our expectations going forward really.
The other thing I'd note too Mike as you know is our guidance of $4.95 to $5.05 brackets what the first call consensus is right now which is $5.02.
Research Division</strong> Understood.
So Tom maybe you just want to add to that.
So Tom you think that the FX impact right now and the bottom line for 2012 would be a negative 2 to 4 points? Yes I mean we factored these rates in and clearly that had an impact on the progression of our forecast as we worked through the fourth quarter and worked on our plan.
And these rates have definitely affected us and that's in our numbers for 2012.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Any additional sensitivity you can give us on that Tom just so we can think about it going forward? Obviously if the dollar weakens or strengthens from here we can think about the potential impact on the company's bottom line.
I think historically people have viewed Abbott as being relatively insulated absent some of the currencies where you can't hedge like Latin America.
Yes as we -- the closer we get to a year the more -- the less exposed we are to currency.
And that has to do with the way exchange rates get into inventories and some of our other natural positions.
So the further out you are the harder it is to forecast.
The closer you get into a year it gets a little less -- a little more predictable.
And I feel like we're in pretty good shape here.
And certainly it's manageable.
Even if rates do go up or down I think we can manage 2012 within this guidance range.
Research Division</strong> Okay 2 other maybe quick follow-ups.
One could you just talk about HUMIRA in the quarter and then focus really on the U.S.
which was obviously very very strong? Just would like to get your sense of the -- if there's anything in there that aided the quarter because it's obviously well above recent trends.
And then second the FX impact on gross margin is a bit tough.
Obviously it helped a little bit this quarter.
In that 2012 guidance for gross margin improvement how much is FX a factor on that line? Yes.
On HUMIRA nothing unusual in the U.S.
The script rates are strong.
And when you look at the overall dynamics on the product growth it's very much in line with expectations there.
For 2012 I'd say a modest part of the margin improvement is exchange.
And there's a lot of -- the majority of it is operating performance the cost-reduction programs that we've talked about efficiencies product mix and the like.
Yes.
Mike the only thing I'd add to there on the HUMIRA is what we said in the past and what we talked about in October at the meeting and Rick talked about is the differentiation of HUMIRA in terms of breadth of indications depth of clinical data our differentiating efficacy and safety profile our strong managed care position.
Derm share has been picking up nicely as is gastro share.
Those have all combined to make this what we think is a durable growth vehicle going forward.
I think some of the expectations and uncertainty around some of the other products in the market have dissipated as more data has come out on things like orals and so forth.
And so we've seen competition in the past.
Every year since we've had this product there have been multiple products that have been in the market.
HUMIRA continues to shine in terms of its overall profile.
And so we don't expect anything to change that overall trajectory of strong double-digit growth here particularly for this year.
Mike this is Miles again.
I can't help but chuckle here because I recall in October you advocating to me that we should take a more cautious view of earnings growth in 2012.
And I'm wondering if you had some prescient view of exchange.
And if you had I wish you'd said so.
Research Division</strong> No if that's the case I wouldn't be on this call.
I'd be doing something else.
Actually the conservatism is -- for me is as you know is top and bottom line just setting a bar that's reasonable and achievable.
Yes.
And I'd also say too Mike.
You know this.
I mean the other countries are also discussing the impact of foreign exchange.
And I think when all the companies report at the end of the day like is usually the case in a week or 2 our growth on a relative basis will be strong and in the upper half of the group.
I think I could add to that.
I'm pretty happy with what I see in the operating performance of the company right now on so many dimensions.
I'm happy with the commercial performance of a lot of our businesses.
There's still places we can make improvements no question.
But I think in general I'm very pleased with what I call the operating execution.
And I'm pleased to see even earlier than I might have expected some of the impact on gross margin because I do expect even greater improvement because I think there's a couple of target-rich opportunities for us in the businesses to improve our margins so that's a good thing.
While we've got a lot of these product launches or registrations underway with both EPD and frankly even our Nutrition business internationally we had 52 new products launched in the Nutrition business last year which is very important to filling out the product lines and the strategies and the countries.
And so we've got a lot of really good things going on.
Now we know that we'll experience the beginning of our lipid franchise going generic this year.
HUMIRA's growth and momentum will I think nicely offset that to a large degree.
There's actually a lot of good fundamental things going on here that I think position us well actually in both companies.
So exchange is little harder to predict.
If it goes better than we think we'll be happy.
And if it doesn't we'll do everything we can to adjust to it.
But I think with all the moving parts of the businesses right now I think this is the prudent place to be.
That's the one thing we can't control very well.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Miles I wanted to come back to Hep C where you made some interesting comments.
I think one of the interesting things when you started talking more about your Hep C program earlier this year was the diversity of that program.
And I guess as you look out at the next 3 to 5 years in terms of the multitude of players that are getting more active in this market are you comfortable with your organic program or internal program on Hep C as you see the market developing over the next 3 to 5 years? Yes I think so.
I mean I think that there's been an awful lot of attention paid to everybody in the category.
And I think we surprised some people when we exposed our program in more detail in October.
I mean we've obviously seen a -- so we said changing competitive response out there.
I think we've got a really promising program here.
And we like what we're holding.
Well I think as you've seen from the -- well it's fair to say some of the reaction out there it's a highly valued segment.
And I observe that and I think man if that's how people think of it the value of our pipeline must be astronomical.
I mean we have all the types of assets we need.
I'm very pleased with what we've got and the potential for it as it particularly impacts patients and the disease.
So yes I'm very hopeful and very optimistic about the program and very excited about it for the pharma business.
Yes.
And as a reminder Dave we talked about this in October.
But we did show some of that first 12-week course of therapy.
It's a smaller subset of patients but it did demonstrate that 90% cure rate and most importantly without interferon.
And we think that's critical obviously to these new therapies and where we're going and the promise of our program.
And as I mentioned in my remarks we're going to present some of the initial Phase IIb full data set later this fall and also in the spring.
Research Division</strong> Okay very helpful John.
And maybe one more strategic here for Miles and maybe one for Tom.
Miles I know it's early but you did mention a restatement of your prior remarks which is that you are committed to a total dividend for both assets that's equivalent to the prior dividend.
I guess is it still too early to suggest that -- is it a reasonable assumption to assume that of the 2 assets we see generally speaking a higher relative dividend on the pharma asset and generally speaking perhaps more debt on the pharmaceutical asset relative to the diversified asset? Yes.
It's too early for me to comment on any of that.
I think when we're ready later in the year to put out the split of the economics of the companies and all those sorts of things we'll address it then.
But yes it's too premature.
The main thing is look our investors have come to rely on and expect a certain cash return.
And we're well aware that the profiles of the 2 businesses which frankly owes to the different investment identity of the 2 businesses would suggest they would not be necessarily identical on a lot of dimensions.
So I understand the nature of the question.
I think we'll deal with it when the time comes.
But look they are 2 different investment identities.
We understand the question and we'll have an answer for you later in the year.
But in the meantime our investors in addition to the growth profile we provide do expect a certain cash return that's a combination of dividend and/or share repurchase from time to time.
And what we do know is that because investors will initially hold both shares it's important for us to make sure there's no diminution of that cash return to investors.
How we split it remains to be seen.
Research Division</strong> Okay very helpful Miles.
And just real quickly Tom.
You’ve talked a lot about Nutritionals and opportunity for margin expansion which seems very clear.
And Miles also reiterated it.
But from a top line growth perspective are you comfortable with where the current growth profile of the Nutritional business and the current market share for Nutritionals sort of post the recall? Are we sort of back to where you want to be? Or is there still significant room for upside in either growth reacceleration or share? David you've got 2 different markets.
There's the U.S.
market and then there's the international market.
And of course there's 2 different markets internationally 1 Europe 1 the rest of the world.
The U.S.
market for Nutritionals is not particularly a growth market as a market.
But our team has done really well there.
We have regained all the share that was impacted by the recall.
And they've done a nice job in the U.S.
of gaining share relative to competition over the last several years.
But the U.S.
market for infant nutrition is a declining market slightly declining.
At least for the last couple of years it has been.
And we've gained share against that headwind and grown.
So do I expect to see the same kind of performance out of our business? I will say that is certainly what we press for.
It's a well-performing business.
I like the plans; I like the team; I like the product portfolio.
I think it's a well-executing team.
So I expect to continue to see good performance out of the U.S.
The growth profile overseas I think should improve.
And I think it's already a strong growth profile but there's a tailwind of market growth there too particularly in emerging markets.
And I think in addition to margin expansion there's a growth expansion expectation that I expect to see here over time as we fill out the product offerings and the product lines in the given geography.
So I think this business has an awful lot of opportunity for us going forward here.
Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
Research Division</strong> Just on the gross margin guidance I guess given the pending split perhaps you could tell us a little bit about more where the margin expansion is coming from whether it's the pharma side or the diversified side first.
I'd say the pharma side is relatively stable.
You have HUMIRA continuing to grow which is a solid product and we do have the kind of the slowdown in the lipids so fairly neutral on pharma and better progress in the diversified businesses.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And secondly this – I’ll apologize in advance; it might be a tough question.
But Miles I was wondering if you could comment on what you intend to do with your shares in the pharma company post the split.
Would you intend to hold them? Or would there be potential conflicts of interest there that -- or other reasons that might prevent you from doing so? No conflicts of interest.
I intend to hold them.
I'm confident for both companies.
Our next question is from Barbara Ryan from Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> So maybe as you talk about -- and I can understand the huge undertaking of splitting the 2 businesses.
But can you give us some sense of timing beyond later this year and just in terms of seeing numbers for the different businesses? And how would you envision that coming out? Would it come out with a quarterly earnings release? Any more color on that would be really helpful.
Sure.
So I think the next big data point will be the submission of the Form 10 which we expect by the later part of the first half.
As you know that's where we basically carve out the proprietary pharma business historically in a way that -- as if it had been an independent company during that period.
That's a pretty extensive process.
To go through that we have to obviously -- we're just finishing the closing of the books for 2011.
We've now completed that and now we are in the process of going through a carve-out and audit procedure to come up with that Form 10 information.
So that would be the first data point.
And in the meantime we'll be refining our outlook for the remainder of '12 and going into 2013 for the 2 businesses and we'll be able to talk more prospectively about them.
And you can expect increasing investor relations activity in the second half of the year in the timeframe consistent with completing the separation by the end of the year.
So Miles and Rick and the various management teams will be out interacting and talking about the future outlook for these companies in that timeframe.
Yes.
Barbara the only thing I'm going to add there is on the Form 10 I would just caution everybody that that is going to be a historical document.
And as we work to separate the businesses and the products and so forth you’ll have to be a little careful at the time of that document that you don't extrapolate that forward too much and draw too many conclusions.
Separately when we do the roadshows for these businesses we'll talk about outlooks and things like that.
So just be a little careful with that information.
We can help you at the time of it.
It serves a purpose but it shouldn't be misconstrued in the wrong way about forward-looking projections and...
Research Division</strong> Okay I guess part of that is the capital structure that each company would have going forward versus the past.
Yes.
To John's point the historical capital structure of the 2 businesses in the Form 10 will be quite different than what the capital structure of these companies will be in the future.
That's just one example of the types of things we're going to have to help investors through.
Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
Research Division</strong> Miles I wanted to ask one question to you and then one for Tom if I may.
You've given some lofty guidance or some thoughts around the Molecular Diagnostics business in the future.
And if you take away 2012 can you help us understand how that business is going to grow? Is it organic or will there be external adds to that business? And moreover if it's true that Roche happens to consolidate some sort of sequencing business do they get an edge in the molecular side? Or is that really irrelevant to your vision of Molecular Diagnostics in the future? And the second question again for Tom is I think you made a comment about resuming share repurchases in '12.
What is the existing authorization? I'll take the second question first.
We have about $3.4 billion remaining under the authorization so we're in good shape to execute what would be appropriate during 2012.
And as far as the molecular business Tony as you know that's been a great business for us.
We're definitely an emerging leader in that business.
It's about $450 million in sales in '11 growing to what we expect will be more than $1 billion by roughly 2015.
And we factored in all of the different situations there in products and so forth that you're talking about.
So we expect continued strong double-digit growth here in 2012 as well as over the LRP for that business.
Our next question is from Sara Michelmore from Brean Murray.
Carret &amp; Co.
LLC Research Division</strong> Just a follow-up on the EPD business.
I'm just wondering that I guess that mid single-digit growth trajectory you're expecting for '12 struck me as maybe a little bit on the low side.
And I was just wondering if you could help us kind of compare and contrast to kind of what the underlying growth was in 2011.
Is that a similar rate of growth or an uptick? And then Miles you have talked a lot about all these filings and that that should improve the growth prospects going forward.
Is that something that we could see kind of come to bear in the second half of this year? Or is that more of a 2013 or even a 2014 type of event? Yes I think you got 2 things happening here.
In the mix of the EPD business or Established Pharmaceuticals there's a chunk that is generics in Western Europe.
And that business has been under the kind of pressure austerity pressure we've seen in Europe.
And so the kind of growth that we've seen in pure emerging markets has been pretty significant double-digit and that's with only a modest number of these registrations done.
So you've got 2 things happening here.
Over the course of 2012 there will be in addition to the couple of hundred that were filed in the second half of 2011 a lot of filings in a lot of these countries that are our targeted geographies around the world particularly in emerging markets.
And as you would imagine it will take some time to establish those.
So I think you'll see some of that late in the year but I think probably you'll really see the impact of it moving into '13 and beyond.
So while we'll be watching for it do we get the filings done and do we get them done on time and do we get them done in the mass that we intend to in the various countries and so forth the real financial impact of that will be as they take hold and grow beyond that which is probably more likely to be visible to you in a '13 timeframe.
And at the same time we're going to have to by growing those markets dilute we'll call it the austere impact of that chunk of business in Western Europe.
And I'll just add.
I think if you were to look at normalized growth rates in 2011 versus '12 you'd see roughly mid single digits in both.
And one thing to keep in mind is this organization's been in place a little more than one year.
They're just in the very early innings of execution and driving additional growth out of the portfolio and as Miles said adding more and more products to the portfolio.
So you're going to see decent growth this year with very strong emerging markets and accelerating we believe as we go into 2013 and beyond.
And as we said back in October we think that overall probably mid- to upper-type growth is what you should see in this established business over the longer term.
Carret &amp; Co.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay that's really helpful.
And then Tom you did say that the company would again be in the market doing share buybacks.
And I get that there's a lot of management resources being spent on the spin right now.
But I was hoping if just you could -- you or Miles could comment on kind of your thoughts on M&amp;A.
I look at that diversified medical products business in particular and think there's a lot of tuck-in or other type of asset acquisitions that you could do that could further enhance what you have there.
So just curious if M&amp;A is off the table for 2012 or if you're still out there kind of actively looking at things.
Yes okay.
I'll take that Sara.
I don't think I'd say it's off the table per se.
But I would say this philosophically I'm not looking for -- we're not looking for big significant things.
I mean I'd point out to you we did the Reata transaction or deal after our announcement of split.
I think we're always vigilant looking analyzing et cetera in all of our businesses.
We'll always be focused on pipeline enhancements for pharma because I think you practically always have to be.
I don't think there's a particularly robust opportunity set out there today.
I think it's pretty limited and I think valuations are let's call it stratospheric and difficult to justify at this point.
So I think it's very easy to be selective right now on the pharma side.
But I know that Rick and his team and our organization are constantly looking for additional enhancements to our pharma portfolio.
On the device side I think you characterized it well.
You might call it tuck-in or you might call it geographically opportunistic.
There's a few very targeted things that we're interested in.
I would call them focused and smaller.
As a matter of generality I'm not looking for big deals.
And I think to be realistic -- and I agree with our investors on this point.
I think our investors would say look unless you got some really great boy-you-can-hardly-stand-it opportunity husband your cash.
There's better things to do with your cash.
And our investors in these kind of economic times value cash return or holding and accumulating some cash and we are.
So I'm not looking for places to go spend it necessarily unless something is really compelling.
And I'd say right now my push in the organization is a much greater focus on organic performance on organic execution.
We were very busy in M&amp;A activities for the past several years.
As Tom was answering about Established Pharmaceuticals a few moments ago they've gone through a pretty significant integration of our legacy Abbott business Solvay Piramal our arrangement with Zydus in India.
And in the process of integrating that into a single division they also separated it from the proprietary pharma business.
So that was a pretty big effort in the organization.
It's important in all of these businesses to make sure that they're operating at their best organically and particularly in R&amp;D.
And I think philosophically every now and then it's good to pause soak it up and make sure that everything organically is working well whether it's your R&amp;D system your innovation your gross margin performance et cetera and we're very focused on that.
I think when that's all in good shape you're well integrated or separated.
As the case may be the foundation for your M&amp;A activity is stronger.
And so right now I'd say our focus is very much internal very much operational.
But if the right circumstances come along for whether it's tuck-in or nice adjunctive add we'll respond to it.
But I think in that long rambling answer you can kind of hear that we're being very selective.
Our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
LLC Research Division</strong> Just 2 here.
First I was encouraged to see that you guys settled the AndroGel patent cases with Teva and Perrigo.
Should we assume that the terms are similar to the Watson timeline I think 2015 or so? Yes Larry we did have settlements with both of those parties but the terms of those are confidential.
LLC Research Division</strong> So no update on kind of when we should assume kind of a generic launch? In October we talked about 2015 and we feel good about 2015.
LLC Research Division</strong> Great.
And lastly on emerging markets the $2.5 billion for the quarter what was the year-over-year constant currency growth rate? I mean the last time you gave that number for emerging markets you had $2.6 billion I think in the second quarter of '11.
The growth rate would be helpful.
Yes there definitely was currency affecting all sales in the quarter.
But on a constant currency basis for the diversified companies it was up in excess of 10% so double-digit growth there.
And again we define emerging markets pretty broadly.
And in the proprietary business there were some tender ins and outs between the third and fourth quarter.
So it was little less robust in the proprietary business in the quarter.
Okay thank you.
And that concludes our conference call today.
A replay will be available after 11 a.m.
Central Time on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com.
And after 11:00 Central Time via telephone at (203) 369-1366 confirmation code 33692.
The audio replay will be available until 4 p.m.
Central Time on Wednesday February 8 and the IR team is always available.
Thank you for joining us today.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
And this concludes today's conference.
You may disconnect at this time.
Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.
With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr.
John Thomas Vice President Investor Relations and Public Affairs.
Good morning and thanks for joining us.
Also on today's call will be Tom Freyman Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Larry Peepo Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations.
Tom will review the details of our financial results for the quarter as well as our outlook for the year.
Larry and I will then discuss the highlights of our major businesses.
Following our comments we'll take any questions you may have as always.
Some statements made today may be forward-looking including the planned separation of the research-based pharmaceutical company from the diversified medical products company and the expected financial results of the 2 companies after the separation.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2011 and are incorporated by reference.
We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments.
In today's conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
And with that I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom? Thanks John.
As you can see from our earnings news release this morning we had a very strong first quarter delivering double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth and beating our original forecast.
We're very pleased with our start to the year and our outlook for the remainder of 2012.
As a result today we are raising our ongoing EPS guidance range for the full year 2012 by $0.05 on both the bottom and the top of the range reflecting another year of top-tier performance.
For the first quarter we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.03 an increase of 13.2% over the prior year.
Sales increased 5.9% on an operational basis that is excluding an unfavorable 1.3% impact from exchange rates which was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses.
Reported sales increased 4.6%.
In emerging markets broadly defined sales increased more than 10% excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange with double-digit growth in key emerging markets across the businesses.
We also saw meaningful improvement in the adjusted gross margin ratio up 260 basis points from the prior year to more than 61% as a result of the many margin-improvement initiatives we're implementing company-wide.
In the quarter we drove better margin performance across our major businesses including Proprietary Pharmaceuticals Vascular Nutritionals and Diagnostics.
We delivered more than 13% ongoing EPS growth and a 150 basis point improvement in our adjusted operating margin while continuing to invest in the businesses.
Ongoing R&amp;D investment was 10% of sales reflecting continued progress across our new product programs.
We also accelerated SG&amp;A investment behind many of our key products and businesses to drive future growth.
In the non-operating section of the P&amp;L in the quarter the net foreign exchange (gain) loss line was unfavorable $58 million compared to 2011.
Other income in the quarter included a $60 million favorable resolution on a contractual agreement.
These 2 items therefore offset the quarter with neutral effect.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2012 we're raising both our ongoing earnings per share guidance range $0.05 on both ends of the range to $5 to $5.10.
With our planned separation on track for completion by the end of the year the guidance we've provided continues to reflect a full year outlook for the company in total.
Regarding sales growth for 2012 we continue to forecast operational growth in the mid-single digits.
Based on current exchange rates we continue to expect a negative impact of exchange on sales of approximately 2.5% for the full year.
As a result reported sales growth is expected to be in the low single digits in line with the forecast we've provided in January.
Also for 2012 we're forecasting continued improvement in our adjusted gross margin ratio which we continue to expect to approach 62% for the full year.
This reflects efficiency initiatives and favorable mix partially offset by the expected decline in U.S.
lipid sales and promised royalties.
We're forecasting continuing investments to drive growth in 2012 and beyond with full year R&amp;D of 9.5% to 10% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A somewhat under 28% of sales.
Overall we continue to expect to expand our operating margin by around 100 basis points in 2012.
We're forecasting ongoing net interest expense of approximately $425 million and we continue to expect an ongoing tax rate of 14.5% to 15% for the full year 2012.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter.
We're forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.22.
We forecast specified items of $0.07 in the second quarter primarily reflecting costs of previous restructuring and integration actions.
This forecast excludes future one-time costs related to the separation.
Our operational sales growth in the second quarter that is growth before exchange is expected to be in the mid-single digits.
At current exchange rates we expect a roughly 3.5% negative impact from exchange in the second quarter resulted in -- resulting in reported sales growth in the low-single digits.
We're forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 62% in the second quarter an increase from the second quarter of 2011.
As mentioned we remain on track with our plans to separate Abbott into 2 leading health care companies one in diversified medical products and the other in research-based pharmaceuticals.
We believe this separation will provide 2 unique and compelling investment opportunities for shareholders.
Our transition organization has been fully engaged in this separation since our announcement last October.
This is the same organization that executed the separation of our hospital products business and successfully integrated our key acquisitions.
We're currently working through the many details of separating the 2 organizations.
There's a significant amount of work to do but the process is going well and is proceeding according to plan.
Last month we announced that the new research-based pharmaceutical company will be called AbbVie.
The AbbVie name connects the new company to Abbott and its heritage of pioneering science and the "Vie " which suggest the Latin root for life calls attention to the vital work the company does.
During the second quarter we expect to file the initial Form 10 with the SEC for AbbVie.
The Form 10 will provide historical results for AbbVie on a GAAP basis for the past 3 years and for the first quarter of 2012.
These historical results will include an allocation of certain costs previously held at the corporate level to the business.
Amendments are typically made to the Form 10 disclosures after the initial filing as more information becomes available for disclosure including future quarterly results.
We'd expect amendments to our filing as well until it's declared effective which is expected to occur later in the year.
The historical balance sheet is not expected to include an allocation of debt to AbbVie such as debt -- as such debt was incurred for the total Abbott operations and was not associated with specific AbbVie entities.
The final or effective Form 10 will however include pro forma adjustments to reflect the impact of debt levels cash balances and interest expense for AbbVie as an independent company.
The Form 10 is one element in our communications plans for AbbVie and for Abbott post the separation.
We will also have comprehensive industrial relations efforts throughout the year to provide investors with information on the 2 companies as we progress towards the separation.
So in summary we're off to a great start in 2012 beating expectations for the first quarter and raising our outlook for the full year.
This outlook again reflects strong and top-tier performance as we execute the steps necessary to separate Abbott into 2 leading health care companies by the end of the year.
With that let's turn to the business operating highlights.
John? Thanks Tom.
I'll start with the diversified medical products businesses and then Larry will discuss the Proprietary Pharmaceutical business.
Sales for our diversified medical products businesses increased mid-single digits in the first quarter excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
We also continued to expand operating margins on the quarter across our diversified medical products businesses including Nutrition Diagnostics Vascular and Diabetes Care.
Let's start with Nutrition where global sales in the quarter increased more than 10% driven by strong growth in both the U.S.
as well as international.
In the U.S.
sales increased 11% as we continue to maintain our strong market positions in both the Adult and Pediatric Nutritional segments.
U.S.
Pediatric Nutrition sales increased more than 15%.
We continued to gain share and maintain our strong leadership position in the U.S.
infant formula market with Similac.
We expect continued strong growth of this brand throughout the year as we launch new products to support Similac in the prenatal segment of the market.
Our toddler brand PediaSure continues to grow at a double-digit pace.
U.S.
Adult Nutritional sales increased more than 7% driven by double-digit growth of both Ensure and Glucerna.
We expect Ensure and Glucerna collectively to generate roughly $2 billion in full year sales this year globally.
Earlier this week we initiated construction at a new liquid manufacturing facility in Ohio that will primarily support the growth of our U.S.
Adult business.
Abbott is the worldwide leader in adult nutrition.
And as the baby boomer demographic ages we expect continuing market expansion of the Adult Nutritional segment.
Outside of the U.S.
sales increased approximately 10% on an operational basis in Nutritionals including the negative impact of foreign exchange reported sales increased more than 9%.
This growth was driven by 13% growth in Pediatric Nutritionals with double-digit growth in Infant Nutritionals as well as PediaSure.
In the first quarter we initiated more than 10 new product or geographic launches each of which is helping to drive market share gains.
Emerging market sales comprised more than 40% of our total nutritional sales and they increased double-digits this quarter.
In addition to driving sales growth the key priority for our Nutrition business is the expansion of operating margins.
We've implemented an improvement plan to expand our Nutrition margin from the low teens that we saw last year in 2011 to our target of more than 20% by 2015.
We have numerous efforts across the business with 4 main drivers of margin improvement.
Those are: product costs where we're reducing packaging cost ingredient costs and material costs; manufacturing where we're building plants closer to our customers particularly in fast-growing emerging markets; distribution where we're going direct to customers in key geographies; and customer mix where we're improving both our product and geographic mix to focus on more profitable segments.
We're implementing the majority of these improvement initiatives here in 2012 which are expected to drive significant Nutritionals operating margin expansion in 2013 and beyond.
As we look ahead to the second quarter in our global Nutritionals business we expect high single-digit growth on an operational basis and mid to high single-digit growth on a reported basis.
In the U.S.
this includes high-single growth; and internationally this includes high single-digit growth on an operational basis and mid single-digit growth on a reported basis.
Let's move on to our Established Pharmaceuticals business or EPD which includes international sales of our branded generics portfolio.
Sales in the quarter increased 2% on an operational basis.
Including a 3.5% negative impact of foreign exchange reported sales declined low-single digits.
Emerging markets now represent nearly 60% of total EPD sales where many of the pharmaceutical markets are growing at a strong double-digit pace.
We're growing faster in these markets as we continue to expand our presence and launch new brands packaging enhancements and new formulations.
In the first quarter EPD's operational sales in key emerging markets such as India Brazil Russia and China increased collectively 17%.
Our large and growing portfolio of more than 500 Established Pharmaceuticals consists of trusted well-known brands that have broad use throughout the world.
Over the next several years we expect to bring the benefits of these medicines to much broader patient populations through registrations across multiple geographies as well as launches of improved formulations to enhance efficacy and improved convenience.
So looking ahead to the second quarter in EPD we expect low single-digit sales growth on an operational basis and a low single-digit decline on a reported basis which includes for this division an expected negative impact of foreign exchange of more than 6% in the second quarter.
In our global Diabetes Care business worldwide reported sales declined 2.4%.
U.S.
sales increased more than 7% as we continue to execute on our strategy to drive share gains among the insulin-using patient population.
We also recently launched InsuLinx in the U.S.
which is our new blood glucose meter specifically for this segment.
InsuLinx has a touch screen interface and several personalization features designed to improve the diabetes management experience for patients.
International sales in our Diabetes Care business declined 7% on an operational basis.
Including the negative impact of exchange reported sales declined 8.7% due in part to certain reimbursement changes in Europe as well as overall market softness.
The negative impact in Europe was partially offset by stronger growth in emerging markets.
So looking ahead to the second quarter in Diabetes Care we expect low to mid single-digit sales growth on an operational basis and low single-digit reported sales growth.
In our Core Laboratory Diagnostics which includes immunoassay hematology and blood screening global sales in the quarter increased more than 6% on an operational basis.
Reported sales increased 5%.
In the U.S.
sales increased nearly 13%.
This strong growth was driven by continued uptake of our PRISM blood screening system and good momentum that began in the latter part of last year with several key account wins and continued strong commercial execution.
Outside of the U.S.
operational sales increased 5% and reported sales increased 3%.
We delivered strong growth in emerging markets with sales in China Brazil and Russia collectively increasing 25%.
In each of these markets we continue to expand our presence with numerous new account wins internationally including the largest private laboratory in Latin America.
In Point of Care Diagnostics worldwide operational sales this quarter increased more than 19%.
And in Molecular Diagnostics worldwide operational sales increased nearly 8%.
Reported Molecular sales increased 6%.
Looking ahead to the second quarter in our global Diagnostics business we expect mid to high single-digit growth on an operational basis and mid single-digit reported sales growth.
So moving on to medical devices and our Vision Care business where global sales this quarter increased low single digits.
This was primarily driven by mid single-digit growth in cataract our largest most profitable and fastest-growing segment within Vision Care.
We also saw a continued strong double-digit growth in emerging markets such as India and China.
Looking ahead to the second quarter in our Vision Care business we expect low single-digit sales growth on an operational and reported basis.
In our Vascular business excluding certain royalty and supply arrangement revenues worldwide Vascular sales increased nearly 4% and U.S.
Vascular sales increased 8%.
As expected reported sales decreased 5% this quarter as a result of a more than 50% decline in royalty and supply arrangement revenues including PROMUS.
As a reminder the third-party distributor for PROMUS is transitioning away from this product as we approach the end of our distribution agreement this year.
Our Vascular business also delivered strong growth in key emerging markets such as China India and Brazil which all increased at strong double-digit growth rates.
Sales of our XIENCE drug-eluting stent franchise this quarter were a record $404 million representing global growth of nearly 7%.
Abbott holds the clear global leadership position as the world's #1 drug-eluting stent company.
U.S.
XIENCE sales increased more than 19% this quarter driven by the recent U.S.
launches of XIENCE nano and XIENCE PRIME as well as share gains from key account wins in the U.S.
as we further penetrate competitor accounts and broaden our overall footprint.
More than 60% of our drug-eluting stents sales occur outside the United States.
In Japan which is our second largest geographic segment we hold market share of more than 40%.
We recently received approval for XIENCE PRIME in Japan and now have the exclusive position in the long-length Everolimus Eluting stent segment.
Also contributing to Vascular sales growth this quarter was endovascular sales which increased nearly 5%.
In the past year we've launched 7 new endovascular products including most recently U.S.
approval for Absolute Pro our new self-expanding stent for peripheral artery disease.
In our Vascular pipeline we recently presented 2-year data on our ABSORB Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold or BVS which demonstrated impressive efficacy and safety results for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
We also have 2 clinical trials underway studying BVS for peripheral disease.
We continue to expect a full commercial launch of ABSORB in Europe by year end and plan to initiate our U.S.
clinical trial later this year.
MitraClip which is our product for the treatment of mitral regurgitation continues to see strong demand outside of the United States with sales of $25 million this quarter.
So as we look ahead to the second quarter on our global Vascular business excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange as well as certain royalty and supply arrangement revenues we expect sales of our underlying business to grow in the high single digits.
Including the expected decline of royalty and supply arrangement revenues as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange we expect reported sales to decline low single digits in the second quarter.
As a reminder the PROMUS transition will be completed by the end of the year positioning our Vascular business in 2013 for stronger reported sales growth.
Finally as Tom mentioned the adjusted operating margin in the first quarter for the total company increased approximately 150 basis points over 2011.
Nutrition Diagnostics Vascular and Diabetes Care contributed to this expansion with most of the diversified medical products businesses each delivering at least 100 basis points or more margin expansion in their businesses.
In Nutrition as I mentioned we expect to expand the operating margin from the low teens today to more than 20%.
This quarter we saw a good progress towards that goal.
In Diagnostics in addition to strong sales growth we continue to expand our operating margins following a record year of profitability in 2011.
As a reminder this business has had a high single-digit operating margin just a few years ago.
This quarter we delivered an operating margin in the high teens.
We're applying many of our key learnings from the work we've done to improve profitability in our Diagnostic business to our efforts to improve profitability in our Diabetes Care business where we continue to see good improvement on the bottom line.
And in Vascular despite the decline in PROMUS revenues which were expected we delivered operating margin in the high 20s in the quarter.
We expect continued steady margin expansion for our diversified medical products businesses over the course of the year and going into 2013 and beyond.
So with that I'll turn the call over to Larry to cover our Proprietary Pharmaceutical business.
Larry? Thanks John.
Worldwide Proprietary Pharmaceutical sales increased more than 8% before the negative impact of exchange.
On a reported basis sales increased 7% including growth of 6.6% in the U.S.
and nearly 8% internationally.
In immunology global sales of HUMIRA increased more than 19% before the negative impact of exchange.
Performance was driven by international sales growth of 17.4% before exchange and U.S.
sales growth of 22.7% consistent with the underlying trends we saw throughout the quarter.
HUMIRA continues to hold the #1 global share position.
We continue to see strong market growth both in the U.S.
and internationally with HUMIRA demand outpacing the market.
We're continuing our development efforts for HUMIRA including the study of new indications.
We recently received approval from the European Commission for the treatment of ulcerative colitis making HUMIRA the first and only self-injectable biologic therapy for this disease.
The approval also marks the seventh major indication for HUMIRA in the European Union.
We also have a number of other indications currently in late-stage development many of which are unique to HUMIRA.
HUMIRA's utility across a growing number of diseases is one of the many attributes that set it apart from other agents.
HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year well on track to achieve our sales growth outlook for the product in 2012.
Moving on to AndroGel where U.S.
sales were approximately $230 million up more than 23%.
AndroGel holds the #1 market share position in the testosterone replacement market where growth is being driven by increasing diagnosis and treatment.
AndroGel 1.62 our new low-volume formulation has quickly become the second most-prescribed therapy in the market second only to our older formulation AndroGel 1%.
U.S.
sales of CREON were nearly $70 million.
CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts.
U.S.
sales of Lupron were $140 million.
Our 6-month formulation approved last year continues to perform well driving share gains and expanding our category leadership.
U.S.
sales of Synthroid were approximately $130 million in the quarter.
Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and retains more than 20% market share despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago.
Moving on to our more mature lipid franchise where U.S.
TriCor/TRILIPIX sales were $254 million and sales of Niaspan were $190 million.
Our lipid franchise has been impacted by softness in the overall branded cholesterol market as well as continued impact from last year's ACCORD and AIM-HIGH study results as we've previously discussed.
So as we look ahead to the second quarter in our global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business we expect mid- to high-single digit operational sales growth and a forecast for approximately 3% negative impact from foreign exchange.
Moving on to our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals pipeline where we continue to make good progress.
We currently have 30 compounds in human trials including numerous medicines in development with breakthrough potential.
Let's start with immunology where we have a number of next-generation programs underway all with an objective to raise the bar with differentiated efficacy and safety.
This high bar is important as we believe the success of new compounds will be based on their ability to offer incremental efficacy and safety benefits beyond what's currently available to physicians and patients today.
Our DVD-Ig platform holds promise in the treatment of RA as well as other conditions.
This proprietary technology unites 2 antibodies into a single molecule.
Last year we initiated a Phase I study in RA for ABT-122 which combines the established mechanisms anti-TNF and IL-17 with the goal of elevating efficacy and improving the overall clinical profile.
Our anti-CD4 biologic BT-061 in development in partnership with Biotest is currently in Phase II clinical trials for RA and psoriasis.
The way we've structured the collaboration allows us to evaluate Phase 2b data prior to co-funding the Phase III program.
And the product will need to demonstrate a clinically meaningful efficacy benefit greater than currently available therapies to clear the hurdle for advancement.
Our recently announced agreement with Galapagos to develop and commercialize a next-generation oral JAK1 inhibitor is structured similarly.
We believe this molecule which preferentially targets the JAK1 pathway differentiates it from other JAKs in development and may lead to a better overall profile.
The Galapagos compound is currently in Phase IIa development with the potential to start Phase IIb next year.
We are also evaluating a number of other oral candidates including an internal JAK1 a SYK inhibitor as well as next-generation anti-inflammatory modulators or AIMs through our collaboration with Reata.
Moving on to chronic kidney disease which is also on the rise driven by higher rates of diabetes obesity and an aging population.
Bardoxolone is a promising treatment in Phase III development for CKD with our partner Reata.
Bardoxolone is a nerve 2 activator a novel mechanism that improves the kidney's ability to filter and remove waste from the body.
Results from the Phase IIb study of Bardoxolone were unprecedented and showed a significant and sustained improvement in kidney function.
No other treatment to date has demonstrated the ability to reverse the progression of this disease.
The Phase III study called BEACON is an outcomes-based study designed to assess Bardoxolone's ability to forestall or prevent chronic dialysis kidney transplant or cardiovascular death in Stage 4 patients a group that is just pre-dialysis.
Enrollment has been very brisk which reflects the significant need for new therapies in this disease.
We expect results from this 2 000-patient global trial in 2013.
Also in development for the treatment of kidney disease is atrasentan.
Results from a Phase II dose-ranging trial showed atrasentan reduce protein in the urine a symptom that is often predictive of renal function.
We would expect atrasentan to be complementary to Bardoxolone within our portfolio.
A Phase IIb study is currently underway with results expected later this year.
Moving on to neuroscience where we're developing compounds to address conditions such as Alzheimer's Parkinson's schizophrenia pain and MS.
Daclizumab is a next-generation biologic in development for MS.
Last year Abbott and our partner company announced promising results from the first of 2 registrational studies.
The first -- the Phase III study called DECIDE is ongoing.
In this study we hope to confirm the findings observed in the Phase II trial.
If successful we believe a significant reduction in disability and annual relapse rate against an active comparator will be data that is unique to this promising and highly active treatment.
Results from the Phase III study are expected in 2014 with potential commercialization in 2015.
We're also developing an intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease.
The gel currently in advanced clinical development in the U.S.
and marketed as Duodopa in Europe consists of 2 compounds with proven efficacy in this disease levodopa and carbidopa.
Through a unique delivery system the intestinal gel is infused directly into the small intestine via a portable pump.
Yesterday we announced the results from a Phase III trial showing patients treated for 12 weeks reported significant improvements in disease symptoms versus the oral forms of the products.
The results from the study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology meeting later this month.
We expect our U.S.
registration submission to occur this year.
Endometriosis and fibroids are both associated with a number of symptoms including pain and infertility.
Our partnered compound elagolix has a unique profile that provides symptom reduction while avoiding the adverse effects that can sometimes be associated with current treatments.
The Phase II clinical program for fibroids is currently underway and the Phase III study in endometriosis is expected to begin this quarter.
Moving on to oncology where we're focused on developing targeted treatments that inhibit tumor growth and improve response to common cancer therapies.
Elotuzumab is being developed with a partner company for the treatment of multiple myeloma the second most common blood cancer.
Phase II data suggests the potential for improved efficacy versus current treatments.
The Phase III study for Elotuzumab is currently underway.
We also have active PARP and Bcl-2 inhibitor programs as well as a number of other early-stage oncology compounds in development.
And finally turning to our rapidly advancing HCV program where we have a broad portfolio with compounds spanning 3 mechanisms of action including protease non-nucleoside polymerase and NS5A inhibitors.
Recent data suggest the combination regimen will likely prove to be the most effective approach and we're well positioned in that regard given our portfolio.
Earlier this month abstracts for the upcoming EASL meeting were published online including results from 2 of Abbott's Phase II interferon-free HCV studies Pilot and Co-Pilot.
In the Co-Pilot study 2 different doses of our protease inhibitor ABT-450; plus our non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor ABT-333 and ribavirin were administered for 12 weeks.
The results showed sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment in 93% and 95% of treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients.
In these patients response was independent of HCV subtype host IL28B genotype or dose level of ABT-450.
The Pilot study evaluated treatment with ABT-450 plus another of our non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors ABT-072 and ribavirin for 12 weeks.
The results showed sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment in 91% of genotype 1 treatment-naïve patients.
Both regimens were well tolerated and the most reported adverse events were mild in severity.
Full results with longer term follow-up data from these studies as well as a number of other abstracts will be presented at the EASL meeting this week in Barcelona Spain.
We're building on the Pilot and Co-Pilot results with data from our larger global Phase II clinical trials.
These studies include various combinations of all 3 compounds in our portfolio both with and without ribavirin as well as evaluation across various HCV genotypes.
Additional data from these studies which are planned for presentation later this year will shed further light on our promising program.
We have a high level of confidence that our HCV compounds in development will dramatically change the treatment landscape.
We expect to start Phase III studies in 2013 with commercialization in 2015 putting us in a very competitive position from a timing perspective.
So in summary this quarter Abbott delivered strong double-digit performance with ongoing EPS growth of more than 13% and we raised our ongoing earnings per share guidance for the year.
We remain focused on the process of separating Abbott into 2 leading healthcare companies which is on track to be completed by the end of the year.
And with that Tom John and I will be glad to take your questions.
Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.
Research Division</strong> As we think about operating margins Tom I mean clearly in particular on the Nutritional side John laid out very thoroughly and clearly some of the drivers there.
Can you talk a little bit more just over the next -- looking ahead over the next couple of years and as the company separates what are the bigger -- biggest margin drivers beyond this Nutritionals program? Is it diabetes? What's next? And is this going to be -- are these similar programs that you laid out for Nutritional? Or is it more about cost? Just again any perspective would be welcome.
Where do we go from here? Well I think what John said in his remarks is a good representation of the way we're approaching it.
And I think our experience in diagnostics really helped a lot in this regard.
And we talked about this in the past.
What that team did is they didn't limit their analysis of their business to just the cost area.
They really looked comprehensively at their P&amp;Ls all the way from the top to the bottom line.
They did a lot of thinking through mix product mix customer mix profitability by customer segment.
And they did some very good analytics and addressed some of the challenges there that really weren't evident as we looked at these businesses differently prior to their -- to the work they did in that area.
And we've really taken that approach and that template and brought it over to the other businesses and very comprehensively looked at each.
So -- as John described in his Nutritional discussion there it's a pretty broad range of things beyond just the cost area.
And our other businesses have done similar exercises.
In terms of what's going to drive operating margin improvement for the diversified company certainly the biggest opportunity over the next 2 3 years is nutrition.
I think that's where we see the highest ramp.
We were -- in the 13 range I think an operating margin couple of years ago and we see a very good path to 20 here the next 2 3 years and we have a very thorough plan to get there.
So that clearly is the biggest mover.
But every single business is continuing to execute on their programs again similar to what Diagnostics did.
And we see steady improvement in each business including Diagnostics.
While we've gotten that business up into the upper teens we clearly see that getting well into the 20s in the next couple of years as well as they continue to execute.
So it's a way of doing business.
It's a continual process.
And I think across the businesses it's going to contribute to a good margin expansion element of the diversified company as we move forward.
Research Division</strong> And follow-up with 2 product or division-related questions.
Core Lab U.S.
up 13% an excellent performance.
Maybe highlight some other pipeline products and how sustainable.
And last on ABSORB given the EU launch later this year maybe you could update us in terms of just some basic expectations about the penetration the product is likely to get in the first year or so post-launch? Yes let me take the first part.
So ABSORB has been doing well in a limited clinical setting as we've described before.
And then we expect full commercialization launch later this year.
The reaction has been very good from clinicians around the world.
And as you know the data results that we've showed so far are similar to what we have seen with XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME in terms of the safety profile and the efficacy.
So very encouraged there.
And as I mentioned later this year plans to start the U.S.
trial remain on track there.
So it's a good story there.
In Core Lab it's been -- it's interesting because it's a business frankly that we haven't talked a lot about the different products and tests like we used to.
But there have been a number of new products that have been launched new assays.
PRISM obviously has been important as that expands.
We had good growth there with both of those systems particularly in some emerging markets around the world where -- markets like China we've grown in excess of 35% grown twice the market.
Brazil we've had very good traction with our Vitamin D and Chagas test.
Russia is growing excess of 30%.
It's off a smaller base.
But we're really investing in some of those emerging markets and leveraging our overall global leadership position is definitely making a big difference.
And then as I mentioned in my remarks we did win the largest private laboratory in Latin America in the first quarter this year.
So those are the good things.
The European market has been a little challenging I think for everybody.
Other competitors have talked about that but that's one of the things that you have to deal with and we plan for.
We also have had some specific tests in the pipeline last year for example the Vitamin D test that I mentioned; launched a number of new assays this year include diabetes and cardiac markers.
And then we have other things that we've done in that business as you know with our acquisition of STARLIMS.
That was the first -- our first entrée into informatics.
And we've launched what we call OneLab which is an offshoot of the STARLIMS system.
That's gaining some good traction and giving our customers some options that they didn't have before.
Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.
Research Division</strong> So first one -- let me ask on Hep C.
So what are we going to see additionally at EASL that we didn't see in the abstracts? Most of our abstract Mike this is Larry contain the information that we have at EASL.
So when they posted earlier this month that pretty much encompassed all of our data.
And again the key data there for us would be the Co-Pilot data which showed very strong SVR12 rates of 93% and 95%.
And then Pilot also was very strong.
SVR rates SVR24 actually at 91%.
But most of the abstracts that have been released back in early April will be comprehensive of what we have at EASL this weekend.
Research Division</strong> One of the questions that people have had has been bounced about on the Street post the release of the abstracts is the difference in the response rates between the non-CC naïve patients and those that are non-CC treatment failure patients interferon failure patients.
Do you have any thoughts as to why there's such a difference in response rates between those 2 groups? Obviously the N is small but there's a pretty strong difference there.
Well people who are non-responders are certainly the most difficult to treat right? And this data that we have right now is kind of our first foray into that group and it does only include 2 of our agents the protease inhibitor as well as the polymerase.
And so as you know we've got additional studies underway CC as I mentioned later this year that are inclusive of the NS5A which we believe to be a much more potent group.
But that 47% SVR rate within that non-responder group is actually better than just about anything else that's been put forth to date including some pretty low-level response rates from the new class that we've seen here over the last 6 weeks.
So I would say that 47% looks very good relative to anything else that we've seen.
And I think we'll see more again later this year when we put together a more potent agent NS5A in combination with this tough-to-treat patient population.
Yes.
And then of course Mike the other data that we showed in the most prevalent form of the virus in developed markets the GT1 treatment-naïve patients that's where we saw the cure rates in excess of 90%.
So those were unprecedented types of results.
It's obviously as Larry said early data and we expect to have more data later in the year on a broader patient population.
But clearly I think that put us in a leadership position in HCV.
Research Division</strong> Good.
Let me ask one question on EPD.
The performance this quarter was a bit light of our thinking.
I think it was up 1.8% constant currency.
At the Analyst Meeting you guys had talked about EPD growing mid- to high-single digits going forward and I know emerging markets are close to 60% of the revenues.
So help us out there what is going on in EPD? It's important because it's 1/3 of the profits for new Abbott so it's going to be a key driver.
So why is growth in the low-single digits right now? Why isn't it in that mid to high single-digit range you guys talked about? Well obviously that mid to high was a bit of a longer-term target for this group.
And the results in the first quarter were very consistent with the guidance we provided in January.
And what's happening -- this organization has been in place for a little more than the year.
There are a number of their geographic expansion initiatives and products expansion initiatives which are just in the early stages.
Programs such as the Zydus collaboration which will bring new molecules to the market and some of the payback on some of the commercial investments that have been made over the last -- over the first year or so are still a bit further out.
So I think we're on track in the first quarter.
We do expect the growth rates to improve later in the year.
There's been -- as you know there is a base part of this business that is the developed world that is growing a bit more slowly.
And in the first quarter we were working through a little bit of a headwind in some of the European countries there as we progressed through the year.
But I think the comps will get better particularly in the third and fourth quarter.
And as we exit the year our forecast show that we'll be much closer to that range we talked about at the Analyst Meeting as we progress into 2013.
So we expect better growth.
I think you'll see it.
And we'll just have to keep monitoring it as we go forward.
Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just a few questions Tom.
TriCor what are your expectations for revenues going forward? Just given the settlement that you've reached with Teva and Teva's commentary that the FDA has issues with their formulation and won't be launching this year do you anticipate that there will be other generics on the market? And does your settlement agreement allow for other generics to reach the market? And then I have a follow-up question on HUMIRA growth which has been quite remarkable in terms of the re-acceleration we've seen with HUMIRA growth in the U.S.
along with the entire anti-TNF class.
And I'm just wondering what you think is going on.
And as you know there will be a JAK inhibitor potentially reaching the market in the second half of this year and if your guidance for the full year incorporates a competitive dynamic and if you could just share with us what you're thinking is.
Yes so this is Tom.
On TriCor I mean I've heard some of the comments you mentioned from Teva but we can't make assumptions on what they're going to do or not going to do.
And clearly they have a right to enter the market in the second half.
And so we continue to model that.
I think even if there was somewhat of a delay there over the -- even the near term or the medium term that's not real meaningful for us because clearly as we move into 2013 and '14 these lipid products are in their last phases and we don't have expectations for sales for those products.
So that issue may be a little more meaningful for the other company than it is for us and we'll see how it plays out in the second half.
John you want to take -- or Larry you want to take the HUMIRA? Sure.
This is Larry.
The market growth has been very strong for biologics overall and I think you'll see that our growth from a prescription trend basis is growing even faster than the market.
I think from an overall market maybe we're seeing a little bit more contribution from the dermatology side which as you know has very low levels of penetration currently.
I think that's lifting the overall biologics market.
I think unique to HUMIRA has just been some very strong commercial execution across all the categories.
We continue to see very good share momentum particularly in dermatology relative to Enbrel as well as in the gastro space relative to the Cimzias of the world.
We continue to see really nice market share gains there.
And room has held in there quite nicely for us as well despite an increased level of competition from smaller players who have garnered I would say pretty low levels of share overall.
Now you asked about our contemplation of a potential launch of Pfizer's tofacitinib product.
We pretty much as -- almost like in the TriCor situation we have to assume that they will be successful with their ultimate approval on a PDUFA date which I believe is in August.
And so we've factored that into our outlook for the year.
And certainly we feel very good about our position the strength of HUMIRA relative to that product's launch.
But to your specific question yes we have factored that into our outlook for this year.
Research Division</strong> And just Tom very quickly on your tax rate guidance for the year of 14.5% to 15%.
Does that contemplate an R&amp;D tax credit? Is that already in that number? No we do not assume that at this point in time.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Tom just wanted to come back to EPD for a second.
So it does appear that the key emerging markets with NS7 are performing actually quite well.
So I wonder is the performance today which I know you hope to get better is that more a function of the BRICs not growing as fast as you want or expected? Or is it a situation with the non-BRIC markets that may be more developed in nature are being pressured for economic reasons kind of at this current time? Yes it's -- well it's the non-BRIC.
But all -- we frankly -- as we look at this business not really on the long term the medium term we have factored into that mid to upper expectation on sales growth the fact that this base business will not grow as fast.
But as the emerging markets grow as fast as we expect and as it becomes a higher percentage of the business I think it's going to support growth in the range that we have targeted.
I will say as a part of the latter part of 2011 and in the first quarter of 2012 there still is some residual austerity effect coming through in the developed world element of this business.
And that's a little bit of what you're seeing in the first quarter a bit of headwind.
But in the BRIC areas very strong double-digit growth and we're really pleased with how the business is executing in those areas.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Maybe just a quick question for Larry on Hep C.
Larry have there been any decisions made about if you look at the regimens in Pilot and Co-Pilot about which of those regimens if any are going to be brought into Phase III? No final decisions on Phase III at this point in time.
I would say one thing that we learned from Pilot/Co-Pilot though is that we used ABT-072 in Pilot.
That's our again the polymerase inhibitor and we used 333 in Co-Pilot.
As you can see in the Phase IIb studies that we've described on clinicaltrials.gov we are moving forward in Phase IIb with the ABT-333 polymerase.
But I think more importantly is the data that's coming from our broader Phase II program Aviator and Navigator that really combine and have various arms that have again various combinations of these 3 compounds with and without ribavirin that will really be the guide to what we move forward with into Phase III.
And again right now we're talking initiation of Phase III in 2013.
But as you can imagine we're working very hard to have that occur as soon as we can.
But that's our guidance today.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then maybe just one quick -- I'm sorry for John or Tom.
You talked about nutritional opportunities obviously a significant driver of what -- of DMP growth.
You talked about 2 different opportunities: the first which is a cost-driven opportunity; the second is mix.
I guess I'm just curious can both of those opportunities move forward simultaneously? Or should we think of them as sort of a phase -- a phased effect? No.
I mean all of the margin initiatives are being addressed concurrently as aggressively as the organization can do it.
So it's going to -- there's no reason to phase things.
And there are numerous numerous -- literally over 100 programs that the business is executing on as we speak.
Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> Two questions.
One on HUMIRA the o U.S.
strength.
Can you comment about -- I can't imagine it's entering new markets so it must be indications.
So maybe discuss what's driving the international growth? Then my second question is on U.S.
stents.
Can you give us a sense of what pricing has been doing in the market sequentially and what DES penetration was in the first quarter? Yes.
Let me take the last part first Glenn.
So stent pricing actually has moderated nicely from what we've seen as you know last year throughout the year.
And I think the competitors saw this as well.
It was declining in the high-single digits.
It's moderated to mid-single digits price decline.
And that is a function of a number of different things.
One on our end is the launch of both nano and PRIME.
So getting into the short lengths and the longer lengths -- small vessels and longer lengths excuse me.
And that -- those are premium products and I think that's helped stabilize as well and some other competitive launches in addition.
So that's one thing.
DES penetration has been around 80%.
And with PROMUS out of the mix as you know too that helps our overall pricing situation now that they're no longer part of that third-party revenue line in our overall numbers.
So DES penetration is good.
PCI volume has been up nicely particularly outside the U.S.
and certain emerging markets it's growing in the mid-teens.
So the dynamics there are good for the underlying business despite the noise and as I mentioned on the call.
And it's really about setting up the business for much stronger growth in 2013 as we get through this transition year with PROMUS coming out of the numbers for us.
LLC Research Division</strong> Can I ask one follow-up just U.S.
PCI volume is -- that's been kind of tracking flat to up a little down a little.
Any indication what that was in the first quarter? And the 80% DES penetration is that better than what we've seen in the second half of last year? Yes it is slightly better.
We were seeing -- pushing upwards of 80% 79%.
That's the first time that we've gotten to 80% in a while.
And the U.S.
you're right.
PCI volume there has been relatively flat and down just very slightly sequentially.
But as I mentioned up kind of in the mid-single digits worldwide.
And then certain international emerging markets been up quite strongly.
LLC Research Division</strong> And then just the international HUMIRA growth? Sure.
Yes.
I think it's a combination of factors Glenn.
Certainly HUMIRA has a leadership position and as a leader grows probably in excess of the marketplace most quarters.
That leadership extends across as I said now 7 indications.
So it is somewhat driven by new indications.
It's also driven by some expansion in geographic presence.
Japan continues to move forward nicely.
We've launched in China.
But I think in general the overall driving factor is just market growth.
We continue to see across the major markets growth rates anywhere from 14% to 20% just based again on the benefits that the product brings relative to the downstream cost that can be incurred for not treating the severity of these diseases.
So market growth is probably your primary driver there in the international side and we're growing a little bit faster than those markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> And that 14% to 20% should we assume it's closer to 14% in Europe and 20% outside of Europe? Or is it a little bit slower in Europe? The Europes are in that range.
Our final question today is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
Research Division</strong> Just a follow-up on EPD.
I think you guys reported in 2011 pricing was minus 1 to 2.
Is that still kind of the run rate you're seeing for that business? Yes that's probably about right.
A little -- probably closer to 2.
Research Division</strong> Okay fair enough.
And I guess just following up on HUMIRA x U.S.
I know you don't want to get too specific on this but is it reasonable to assume a double-digit ongoing constant currency-type growth for that product again in international markets over the next few years? Yes it's always hard to project out that far Rajeev.
But again here we are in 2012 and those markets continue to grow in the range that I just indicated.
That's pretty strong growth.
Now certainly our product gets bigger and bigger every year.
So dollars of growth can continue to be quite strong.
The percentage just based on the way the numbers work starts to come down a little bit but we foresee good growth there internationally.
Yes.
I mean you'll recall from the October investor meeting Rick Gonzalez talked about $1 billion-plus in raw dollars of HUMIRA growth over the next few years.
So certainly as a percentage that would be double digits in '13 and probably '14.
But that gives you an idea of what we think the continuing growth potential of the product is as we look out 2 3 years.
Research Division</strong> Yes.
No that's very helpful.
It just seems like the product just continues to move ahead at a -- such a brisk pace.
I appreciate the color.
Well the performance has been good and we think the durability is very strong as well over the long term.
Yes.
And don't forget all the indications that we have.
And we just got another one as you know in Europe.
So the utility of the product has been amazing and it's a great great well-positioned product for the long-term.
Okay? All right.
And that concludes our conference call.

Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.
With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.
And I would now like to introduce Mr.
John Thomas Vice President Investor Relations and Public Affairs.
Good morning and thanks for joining us.
Also on today's call will be Tom Freyman Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Larry Peepo Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations.
Tom will review the details of our financial results for the quarter and outlook for the year.
Larry and I will then discuss the highlights of our major businesses.
Following our comments as always we'll take any questions that you might have.
Some statements made today may be forward-looking including the planned separation of the research-based pharmaceutical company AbbVie from the diversified medical products company Abbott and the expected financial results of the 2 companies after separation.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2011 and are incorporated by reference.
We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments.
In today's conference call as we always do non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand our ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
And with that I will now turn the call over to Tom.
Tom? Thanks John.
For the second quarter of 2012 Abbott delivered ongoing earnings per share that exceeded our guidance range reflecting growth of nearly 10% and we're confirming our full year ongoing EPS guidance range for 2012.
We also made significant progress in our work to separate our research-based pharmaceutical business into a new publicly traded company and we remain on track to complete the separation at the end of this year.
For the second quarter we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.23 an increase of nearly 10% over the prior year exceeding our ongoing EPS guidance range of $1.20 to $1.22.
Sales for the quarter increased 6.7% on an operational basis that is excluding an unfavorable 4.7% impact from exchange rates.
Operational growth was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses including emerging market operational growth of more than 12%.
Including the negative impact of exchange reported sales increased 2%.
In the second quarter we experienced one of the larger exchange effects we've seen in a single quarter in some time.
This exchange impact was approximately 1% more unfavorable than our estimate when we provided guidance in April reflecting changes in rates since that point in time.
Given the significant impact of exchange on top line results to understand underlying growth across our businesses it's particularly important this quarter to focus on operational growth that is growth before the impact of exchange as detailed in our earnings news release.
For example exchange trimmed almost 10% off reported growth in our international Proprietary Pharmaceuticals and Established Pharmaceuticals businesses in the quarter.
Both businesses reported accelerating operational growth in the quarter at or above our previous expectations.
To help you understand underlying growth in both the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals and diversified medical products businesses John and Larry will also outline exchange impact in detail in their remarks as well as other transactional effects impacting some of the businesses such as the phaseout of Promus royalty revenue in the Vascular business.
As we'll discuss today exchange is expected to continue to impact sales in a significant way in the second half in particular in the third quarter.
During the quarter we also saw a continued meaningful improvement in the adjusted gross margin ratio up 310 basis points from the prior year or more than 63% as a result of the many margin improvement initiatives we've been implementing across our businesses as well as the impact of exchange.
In the quarter we saw improvements in the operating margin ratios over the prior year in our Vascular Nutritionals and Diagnostics businesses.
In the quarter we delivered a 170-basis-point improvement in the company's adjusted operating margin ratio while continuing to invest in the businesses.
Ongoing R&amp;D investment approached 10% of sales reflecting continued progress across our new product programs.
We also increased SG&amp;A investment behind many of our key products and businesses to drive future growth.
Turning to our outlook for 2012.
Today we're confirming our full year 2012 ongoing earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.10 which represents growth of 8.4% over 2011 at the midpoint of the range.
With our planned separation on track for completion at the end of this year the guidance we provided continues to reflect a full year outlook for the company in total.
Regarding sales growth for 2012 we continue to forecast a full year operational growth in the mid-single digits.
Based on current exchange rates we would see a negative impact of exchange on sales of approximately 3.5% for the full year which is 1 percentage point more negative than our previous guidance.
We continue to forecast reported sales growth that is net of exchange in the low single digits for the full year.
Also for 2012 we're forecasting continued improvement over the prior year in our adjusted gross margin ratio which we expect to exceed 62% for the full year.
This reflects the favorable impact of efficiency initiatives mix and the impact of foreign exchange partially offset by the expected continued decline in U.S.
lipid sales as well as the phaseout of Promus royalty revenues in our Vascular business.
We're forecasting continuing investments to drive growth in 2012 and beyond with full year ongoing R&amp;D of 9.5% to 10% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A of approximately 28% of sales.
Overall we continue to expect to expand our operating margin ratio by around 100 basis points in 2012.
We're forecasting ongoing net interest expense of approximately $425 million and we continue to expect an ongoing tax rate of 14.5% to 15% for the full year 2012.
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter.
We're forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $1.26 to $1.28.
We forecast specified items of $0.15 in the third quarter primarily reflecting onetime costs related to the separation and costs of previous restructuring and integration actions.
I'll discuss onetime separation costs in more detail in a moment.
Our operational sales growth in the third quarter is expected to be in the mid-single digits.
At current exchange rates we'd see a roughly 5-percentage-point negative impact from exchange in the third quarter resulting in reported sales growth in the low single digits.
We're forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 62% in the third quarter an increase from the third quarter of 2011.
As mentioned we remain on track with our plans to separate Abbott at year end into 2 leading health care companies one in diversified medical products which will continue to be named Abbott and the other in research-based pharmaceuticals named AbbVie.
We expect the separation will provide 2 unique and compelling investment opportunities for shareholders.
Our transition organization has been fully engaged in the separation since our announcement and we continue to work through the details of separating the 2 organizations.
The process is proceeding according to plan and is going well.
Most recently last month we filed our initial Form 10 for AbbVie that provided historical results for AbbVie on a GAAP basis for the past 3 years and for the first quarter of 2012.
These historical results include an allocation of certain costs previously held at the corporate level to the business.
In addition senior management assignments for AbbVie were identified.
Also since the April call we've established new short-term credit facilities for both companies which will back up commercial paper borrowings as well as a bridge credit facility to support the previously discussed refinancing of long-term debt in anticipation of the separation.
In the second half of this year we expect to file amendments to the Form 10 as more information becomes available.
These amendments will include 2012 quarterly results for AbbVie as we progress through the year and pro forma adjustments to reflect the impact of expected debt cash balances and interest expense for AbbVie as an independent company.
We'd expect amendments to our filing until it's declared effective later in the year.
Also we're now in a position to forecast 2012 onetime costs associated with the separation.
Through the first 2 quarters of 2012 we've incurred $0.06 per share in separation costs and we expect to incur another $0.17 per share in the second half of 2012.
This is now included in our forecast of specified items for 2012.
As previously indicated as we establish AbbVie's capital structure we'll also expect to incur onetime bond refinancing costs.
As you know all of Abbott's debt is currently carried by the parent company and ultimately a portion of the debt will be carried by AbbVie.
So we have plans to execute a tender process for a portion of the existing Abbott debt funded by the proceeds of debt to be issued by AbbVie.
We expect the AbbVie debt to be issued prior the separation while AbbVie is still a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott.
The expected onetime financing costs associated with that process will be largely a result of today's interest rates being significantly lower than the rates currently paid on Abbott's bonds.
We'll provide a forecast of these onetime costs which will be a function of the dollar amount of bonds tendered and market conditions as we get closer to the tender date in the second half of 2012.
Regarding the timing of separation.
We're on track to be ready to separate at the end of this year assuming approvals progress as expected.
Given this likely timing for a number of reasons it would make sense for Abbott and AbbVie to become separate companies beginning on the first day of the new year.
As you can imagine there are many aspects of the separation that will be simplified by completing the full year 2012 as one Abbott and beginning 2013 as separate companies.
Shortly after final review and approval of the transaction by our board expected later this year we would issue a news release that would announce a special dividend distribution of all the outstanding shares of Abbott -- of common stock of AbbVie to Abbott shareholders as well as the distribution ratio record date and payment date for the distribution which will be the first date that AbbVie is an independent company.
As we proceed towards the separation date we'll be initiating a comprehensive investor relations effort to provide investors with more information regarding the 2 companies.
This will include road shows for both companies with their respective senior management teams.
So in summary we're delivering on our expectations for 2012 and confirming our 2012 ongoing EPS guidance which reflects strong top-tier performance as we execute the steps necessary to separate Abbott into 2 leading healthcare companies at the end of this year.
With that let's turn to the business operating highlights.
John? Thanks Tom.
I'm going to start with our diversified medical products businesses and then Larry will discuss the Proprietary Pharmaceutical business which will become AbbVie.
Operational sales for our diversified medical products businesses increased 4.5% in the second quarter excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
So on a reported basis sales were roughly flat.
As you know this year we're experiencing a negative transitional impact to our top line growth rate from the phaseout of certain royalty revenues in our Vascular business as well as the shift to direct distribution in certain markets in our International Nutrition business.
Excluding these transitional impacts sales for diversified medical products approached 7% this quarter.
We also continued to expand operating margins in the quarter across our diversified medical products businesses including Nutrition Diagnostics Vascular and Diabetes Care.
So let me start with Nutrition where global sales in the quarter increased more than 8% on an operational basis and more than 6% on a reported basis which of course includes the impact of foreign exchange.
In the U.S.
sales increased 13% with U.S.
Pediatric Nutritionals sales increasing 25%.
We continue to increase our share position in the U.S.
infant formula market with Similac and remain the clear market leader.
We expect continued growth of our Similac brand this year as we launch new products to support it in the prenatal segment of the market.
Our toddler brand PediaSure continues to grow at a double-digit pace.
And in the second quarter we launched the new PediaSure SideKicks Clear beverage that is helping to drive growth.
U.S.
Adult Nutritionals sales increased 3% in the quarter as we exited certain lower-margin brands in the quarter as part of our ongoing margin improvement initiative.
Excluding this impact sales increased in the high single digits driven by strong growth of both Ensure and Glucerna.
In fact these 2 products combined are on track to generate roughly $2 billion in full year global sales this year alone.
We continue to launch new innovations to these product lines that are driving sustainable growth.
In the second quarter we launched a new product called Ensure Clear which is a new fruit-flavored Ensure brand with the same supplemental nutrition as our traditional Ensure Shakes.
Outside of the U.S.
Nutritionals sales increased 4.5% on an operational basis with both pediatric and adult nutrition growing at a similar mid-single-digit rate.
As we saw in the second quarter top line growth in International Nutritionals sales this year is expected to be lower than underlying demand as we transition from a distributor model to a direct distribution model in certain markets.
As we discussed this new distribution strategy is another component of a comprehensive initiative in our global Nutrition business to drive significant gross and operating margin improvement.
In fact we expect to improve AN operating margin from the low teens in 2011 to our target of more than 20% by 2015 through these and numerous other efforts.
In addition to the direct distribution I mentioned we're also focused on manufacturing distribution and logistics where we're improving our production processes and building more efficient plants that are closer to our customers particularly in fast-growing emerging markets.
Construction of 3 manufacturing facilities are underway in the U.S.
China and India.
We're also reducing product costs on our Nutrition business such as packaging costs ingredient costs and material costs.
And we're improving our mix.
We're assessing both product and geographic mix to focus on our more profitable Nutrition segments.
We're implementing a number of these improvement initiatives in this year 2012 which are expected to drive significant operating margin expansion in this business beginning next year in 2013 and beyond.
As we look ahead to the third quarter in our global Nutrition business we expect high single-digit growth on an operational basis and mid-to-high single-digit growth on a reported basis with the impact of foreign exchange.
This third quarter outlook for Nutritionals includes mid-to-high single-digit growth in the U.S.
and double-digit operational growth internationally with mid-single-digit growth internationally on a reported basis.
Let's move on to Established Pharmaceuticals which includes international sales of our branded generics portfolio.
Sales in the quarter increased nearly 4% on an operational basis.
Including a nearly 10% negative impact of foreign exchange reported sales declined mid-single digits.
Emerging markets represent about 60% of total EPD sales and in the second quarter emerging markets sales increased in the low double digits on an operational basis.
We're growing in these markets as we continue to expand our presence and launch new brands packaging enhancements and new formulations.
Our large and growing portfolio of more than 500 established pharmaceuticals consists of trusted well-known brands that have broad use throughout the world.
Over the next several years we expect to bring the benefits of these medicines to much broader patient populations through registrations across multiple geographies as well as launches of improved formulations to enhance efficacy and improve convenience.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in EPD we expect mid-single-digit growth on an operational basis that is before the expected nearly 10% negative effect of foreign exchange.
As a result reported sales for the third quarter in EPD are expected to decline in the mid-single digits.
In Core Laboratory Diagnostics which includes immunoassay hematology and blood screening global sales increased 8.6% on an operational basis this quarter.
Reported sales increased 3.3% including a more than 5% negative impact from foreign exchange.
In the U.S.
sales increased 15%.
The strong growth was driven by continued uptake of our ARCHITECT immunoassay and PRISM blood screening systems driven by strong commercial execution.
Outside of the U.S.
sales increased 7% on an operational basis and 1% on a reported basis.
We delivered strong growth in emerging markets with sales in China Brazil and Russia collectively increasing approximately 30% on an operational basis.
In each of these markets we continue to expand our presence with numerous new account wins internationally.
In Point of Care Diagnostics worldwide sales increased more than 14% on an operational basis.
And in Molecular Diagnostics worldwide sales increased 5.5% on an operational basis.
So looking ahead to the third quarter in our global Diagnostics business we expect mid-to-high single-digit growth on an operational basis and low single-digit growth on a reported basis.
So let me move on now to medical devices and our vision care business where global sales increased low single digits in the second quarter on an operational basis.
This was driven by mid-single-digit operational growth in cataract our largest most profitable and fastest-growing segment within vision care.
We also saw a continued strong double-digit cataract growth in a number of key emerging markets such as India and China.
Looking ahead to the third quarter in vision care we expect low single-digit sales on an operational basis and roughly flat sales on a reported basis.
In our global Diabetes Care business worldwide sales increased 3.3% on an operational basis and declined 1% on a reported basis.
U.S.
sales increased more than 8% as we continued to execute on our strategy to drive share gains among insulin-using patients as well as roll out new blood glucose meter InsuLinx in the U.S.
International sales were roughly flat on an operational basis and down more than 7% on a reported basis including an 8% negative impact from foreign exchange.
Looking ahead to the third quarter in Diabetes Care we expect a low single-digit decline on an operational basis and a mid-single-digit decline on a reported basis with better growth expected going into the fourth quarter.
In our Vascular business reported sales in the quarter included the impact of the phaseout of certain royalty and supply arrangement revenues including Promus as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Excluding these impacts worldwide Vascular sales increased 4.6%.
As a reminder the U.S.
Promus transition will be completed by the end of this year and that positions our Vascular business in 2013 for stronger reported sales growth.
Operating margin in our Vascular division remains strong increasing year-over-year.
In the second quarter our Vascular business delivered strong growth internationally increasing 11% on an operational basis.
Sales in emerging markets which comprise more than 20% of total Vascular sales grew more than 25% on an operational basis.
Worldwide sales of our XIENCE drug-eluting stent franchise were approximately $400 million in the quarter and that's an increase of 5.6% on an operational basis.
Outside of the U.S.
which is about 65% of our worldwide drug-eluting stent business sales grew more than 10% on an operational basis.
In Japan in the second quarter we launched XIENCE PRIME our next-generation drug-eluting stent where we continue to hold leading share in the exclusive position in the long-length Everolimus Eluting Stent segment.
In the U.S.
XIENCE sales declined modestly year-over-year despite the expected trialing related to a new competitive product.
And we're on track to launch our next-generation XIENCE Xpedition in the second half of this year in Europe and in 2013 in the United States.
Xpedition combines the impressive safety and efficacy of XIENCE and sets a new standard for deliverability.
Also in our pipeline we continue to expect to launch ABSORB our bioresorbable vascular scaffold in Europe by year end.
To date more than 1 000 patients have received ABSORB.
In Endovascular sales increased in the low single digits on an operational basis including nearly 10% growth internationally.
In structural heart MitralClip which is our product for the treatment of mitral regurgitation continues to see strong demand outside of the U.S.
with sales of $23 million this quarter.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in our global Vascular business including the expected decline of royalty and supply arrangement revenues as I mentioned earlier as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange we would expect reported sales to decline mid-single digits including roughly 5% of negative foreign exchange impact.
Finally we continue to execute on our margin expansion programs as Tom mentioned in each of our major diversified medical products businesses with Nutrition Diagnostics Vascular and Diabetes Care seeing especially good improvement in the second quarter.
As a result the adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points over 2011 as Tom mentioned.
We expect continued steady margin expansion for our diversified medical products businesses over the course of this year and going forward into 2013 and beyond.
So with that let me turn it over to Larry and he will review the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business.
Larry? Thanks John.
Worldwide Proprietary Pharmaceuticals sales increased 9.3% on an operational basis excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange.
On a reported basis global sales increased 4.9% including growth of nearly 8% in the U.S.
and reported growth of approximately 1% internationally which as Tom mentioned includes nearly 10 percentage points of negative exchange.
In immunology global HUMIRA sales increased 23% on an operational basis and more than 16% on a reported basis.
Performance was driven by strong growth in the U.S.
and internationally consistent with the underlying trends we saw throughout the quarter.
We're continuing our development efforts for HUMIRA including the study of new indications.
We recently received a positive opinion in the EU for the treatment of axial SpA a condition associated with chronic back pain and stiffness that can also be accompanied by the presence of arthritis inflammation in the eye or GI tract.
Upon a final decision from the European Commission HUMIRA will be the first and only medication for this chronic condition.
And this approval will mark the eighth major indication for HUMIRA in the European Union.
HUMIRA's utility across a growing number of diseases is one of the many attributes that set it apart from other competitive agents.
HUMIRA currently holds the #1 global share position and demand continues to outpace the global market where we're seeing strong market growth both in the U.S.
and internationally.
We're well on track to achieve our sales growth outlook for HUMIRA in 2012.
Moving onto AndroGel where U.S.
sales were approximately $275 million up more than 26%.
AndroGel holds a strong leadership position in the testosterone replacement market where growth is being driven by increasing diagnosis and treatment of low testosterone.
AndroGel 1.62 our new low-volume formulation has quickly become a leading therapy in the category now accounting for more than half of AndroGel total franchise sales.
U.S.
sales of CREON were $88 million up more than 12%.
CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts.
U.S.
sales of Lupron were $140 million.
Our 6-month formulation approved last year continues to perform well driving share gains and further expanding our category leadership.
U.S.
sales of Synthroid were approximately $120 million in the quarter.
Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and retains more than 20% market share despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago.
Moving on to our more mature lipid franchise where as expected global TriCor/TRILIPIX sales were $388 million down 6.6% and sales of Niaspan were $211 million down 14.7%.
As discussed last quarter our lipid franchise has been impacted by softness in the overall branded cholesterol market as well as continued impact from last year's ACCORD and AIM-HIGH study results.
So as we look ahead to the third quarter in our global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business we expect low single-digit growth on an operational basis.
We're forecasting a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 4.5% which will lower reported growth in the quarter.
Moving on to our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals pipeline where we continue to make good progress.
Starting with our renal care pipeline where we have compounds in development for chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury bardoxolone is a promising treatment in Phase III development for CKD with our partner Reata.
Data to date have been unprecedented showing treatment with bardoxolone produces significant and sustained improvement in kidney function.
Enrollment in the Phase III study is ahead of schedule reflecting the significant demand for new therapies.
We expect results from this 2 000-patient global trial in 2013.
Also in development for the treatment of kidney disease is atrasentan.
Results from a Phase II dose-ranging trial showed atrasentan reduced protein in the urine a symptom that is often predictive of renal function.
A Phase IIb study in patients with diabetic kidney disease is currently underway with results expected later this year.
We recently acquired global rights to a novel investigational compound from Action Pharmaceuticals (sic) [Action Pharma] for the prevention of acute kidney injury or AKI.
AKI is a prevalent complication in patients undergoing major cardiac and abdominal surgery.
There are currently no pharmacologic treatments for AKI which is known to be associated with increased short- and long-term mortality as well as prolonged hospitalization and permanent decline in renal function.
ABT-719 as we now know it is currently in Phase IIb development with potential market entry in the 2015 time frame.
Moving on to immunology where we have a number of next-generation programs underway all with the objective to raise the bar with differentiated efficacy and safety.
This high bar is important as we believe the success of new compounds will be based on their ability to offer incremental efficacy and safety benefits beyond what's currently available to physicians and patients today.
Our programs span both small molecule and biologic targets.
Our next-generation oral JAK-1 inhibitor in development with partnership with Galapagos is currently in Phase IIa development for RA with the potential to start Phase IIb next year.
We believe this molecule which preferentially targets the JAK1 pathway differentiates it from other JAKs in development and may lead to a better overall profile.
The early Phase II results presented at the EULAR meeting last month confirmed this compound's promising profile.
BT-061 is our anti-CD4 biologic in development in partnership with Biotest.
The compound is currently in Phase II clinical trials for RA and psoriasis.
Our DVD-Ig platform holds promise in the treatment of RA as well as other conditions.
This proprietary technology unites 2 antibodies in a single molecule with dual variable domains.
Last year we started a Phase I study of ABT-122 which pairs 2 established mechanisms anti-TNF and IL-17 with the goal of elevating efficacy and improving the overall clinical profile in RA.
Additionally ABT-981 which pairs IL-1alpha and IL-1beta is currently in Phase I for osteoarthritis.
We are also evaluating a number of other oral candidates including an internal JAK1 candidate a SYK inhibitor as well as next-generation antioxidant inflammation modulators or AIMs through our collaboration with Reata.
Moving on to neuroscience where we're developing compounds to address conditions such as Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's schizophrenia pain and MS.
Daclizumab is a next-generation biologic for MS currently in late-stage development with a partner company.
Results from the Phase III study are expected in 2014.
ABT-126 is our alpha7 NRR.
It's currently in mid-stage development for Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
Preclinical and clinical data from this mechanism indicates the potential for improvement in a number of cognitive areas associated with both conditions.
We recently initiated Phase IIb studies in CDS and Alzheimer's disease.
We're also developing an intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease.
The gel currently in advanced clinical development in the U.S.
and marketed as Duodopa in Europe consists of 2 compounds with proven efficacy in this disease.
We expect to complete our U.S.
registration submission this year.
Moving on to oncology where we're focused on developing targeted treatments that inhibit tumor growth and improve response to common cancer therapies.
Elotuzumab is being developed with a partner company for the treatment of multiple myeloma the second most common blood cancer.
The Phase III study which is evaluating elotuzumab and standard of care in both refractory and first-line multiple myeloma is ongoing.
We also have active PARP and Bcl2 inhibitor programs currently underway as well as a number of other early-stage oncology compounds in development.
Moving on to women's health where we're studying elagolix for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis.
The compound has a unique profile that provides symptom reduction while avoiding the significant bone loss or other adverse effects that can sometimes be associated with current treatments.
The Phase IIb -- or Phase II clinical program for fibroids is ongoing and we recently initiated the Phase III study in endometriosis.
And finally turning to our HCV program where we have a broad portfolio with compounds in development spanning 3 mechanisms of action including protease non-nucleoside polymerase and NS5A inhibitors.
We presented Phase II data at the EASL meeting in April demonstrating that Abbott's 12-week interferon-free regimen is capable of delivering 93% to 95% cure rates across all genotype-1 treatment-naive patient subtypes.
Data showed that the regimen which included just 2 of our 3 compounds in development was well tolerated and most adverse events were mild in severity.
We're building on these strong results with data from our large global Phase IIb Aviator trial a 14-arm 560-patient study that includes various combinations of all 3 compounds in our portfolio.
We expect to present results from this study at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases meeting this fall.
We expect to start our Phase III program in 2013 with commercialization in 2015 putting us in a very competitive position.
We have a high level of confidence that our HCV compounds in development will dramatically change the treatment landscape.
So in summary this quarter Abbott delivered strong performance with ongoing EPS growth of nearly 10% exceeding our guidance range and a gross margin ratio of more than 63% up 310 basis points from the prior year.
We confirmed our outlook for 2012 ongoing earnings per share and remain focused on the process of separating Abbott into 2 leading healthcare companies which is on track to be completed at the end of this year.
With that Tom John and I will be glad to take your questions.
Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> Let me just ask one question Tom.
Just on the guidance you kept your guidance unchanged.
We've obviously seen companies this week that have trimmed their guidance for the year because of the currency moves.
Is there a way to calculate what the FX move has meant to your bottom line? I know you guys are pretty well hedged but any way to do that math for us to give a sense of what you're absorbing here? Well Mike as we talked about clearly there was a significant top line impact across the businesses and we tried to provide some pretty good detail on that.
And as we talked about in the past and you alluded to it the way we were structured around the world in terms of our manufacturing sites and kind of our cost centers and really the way we've organized ourselves our read as we compare ourselves to others -- and it's hard to do because we don't know exactly what's going on in other companies -- because of that we're probably somewhat less exposed to currency movements.
I would say that certainly it's not 0.
We have had some effect this year.
But the way we've looked at it and we've gone through the year is that things like this happen every year and we try our best to manage through it.
When John talked about the plants in Nutrition that we're building around the world I think it's indicative of the approach we've taken to some degree.
Certainly when we build those plants and get them closer to the customers it makes a lot of sense from a logistics perspective and in terms of minimizing inventories and the like when you're closer to the markets.
But another benefit we see from that and we really do factor it into our thinking as we look at the plant locations is that there's a better match of currency between revenues and costs.
And I think we've been pursuing that thinking for a number of years as we make our investments.
And -- but I think that does help us be a little -- a little bit less exposed.
So certainly we've had some impact this year but it's fallen into the range of the types of things that happen to the business every year which is our job to manage.
And because of some -- the margin performance you're seeing this quarter some strength in the businesses we're able to confirm our guidance for the 2012 year.
Research Division</strong> With the Form 10 filed this quarter let me just ask a couple of questions that I've gotten a lot the last several weeks.
One of them is as we look to 2013 so if we assume Jan 1 2013 there's these 2 separate companies.
How should we think about the earnings impact of the separation? I think when you guys talked last October you were hoping to offset some of that naturally dilutive impact of having to create a separate infrastructure for AbbVie.
Should we look at it as okay take the 2013 EPS estimate for consensus or your own estimate and then separate that between the 2 companies? Or should we assume that there's some dilution off the 2013 current Abbott number as we separate the 2 companies into separate entities? Yes.
I mean certainly it's too early to talk about 2013 right now.
As we get into the fall and we pursue the road shows that we talked about for the 2 separate companies it'll be a much more appropriate time.
And really once we get through a bit more of the year get through some of our planning processes fully assess what's happening in the environment as we move into next year that's the time when it's best to talk about our outlook for 2013.
So it's a little early now.
To your question I mean it is -- and we've talked about this that it is clear that we need to set up headquarters functions for AbbVie.
We need to incur -- AbbVie will be incurring public company costs such as the audit fees associated with being a public company those types of things and their guidance will factor that in.
It's interesting: I have seen analysts modeling that from other transactions they've seen and certainly there will be some impact.
As you mentioned we did establish a longer-term goal to offset those types of costs to the extent we can and we're working on that as we speak and we'll be able to talk more about that in the fall.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Maybe one last question then.
There obviously is a lot of questions about dividend and how you're going to allocate that between the 2 entities.
I don't expect you to give the answer today but maybe you could help because when people saw the Form 10 they saw that the tax rate for AbbVie in the Form 10 and that got to a whole discussion of U.S.
free cash flow versus o U.S.
free cash flow and the ability of AbbVie to support a significant dividend despite what looks like a significant portion of its cash flow coming outside of the U.S.
Can you just talk to that and just talk about AbbVie's ability to support a significant dividend given what looks like the vast majority of its profits are coming o U.S.? I mean I think the key is -- and when you look at the Form 10 and as we look at our forecast for AbbVie and everyone's known this for quite some time I mean there's very significant cash flow in that company.
And we recognize and as we think through and ultimately the AbbVie board will determine the amount of dividend.
But it's pretty clear as current board and management team thinks through this that this type of business should have a substantial dividend.
When we talk about the total Abbott dividend being at least equal to the existing -- between the 2 companies I should say be at least equal to the Abbott dividend at the time of separation it's very likely that the larger portion of that will be coming from AbbVie.
And they will definitely have the cash flow to support a competitive dividend going forward.
That's another item that we'll be going through in detail exactly how that'll work in the fall when we talk about 2013 for both companies.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Tom I wanted to come back to Nutritionals.
I mean it still remains probably one of the bigger drivers of the Abbott margin story heading into next year and beyond.
So I know you've done some of this publicly but could you maybe quantify the CapEx and derivative spends sort of required to get to those Nutritionals margins by 2015? And I wonder you keep talking about 2015.
Do you see 2015 as the peak margin? Or do we talk about 2015 because that's really the inflection year for margins? Yes to -- and I'll answer the last part of your question first.
I mean we're never satisfied so it was a convenient point in time where a lot of the initiatives we now have underway will have been fully implemented and certainly gets us back into the range of the levels that we think this business should have at a bare minimum.
But you can never rest and certainly there'll be a lot more thinking over the next 2 or 3 years to continue that type of improvement as we go beyond 2015.
I think the best example of that is our own Diagnostics initiative here where we have accomplished tremendous things in the first 3 4 years of that division's margin expansion improvement program.
And as I look at this quarter's margin in Diagnostics and I think of where we were 4 years ago and as I talk to that team and listen to their plans as we move forward the more you work on these things the more opportunity you find.
And I think that's the type of model we're going to continue to apply across all of our businesses.
To your question on capital to me the most encouraging thing about the capital investments we're making in Nutrition is that it's really driven by demand.
And we're building plants in Asia to support rapidly growing markets and developing markets.
That's a very good thing.
And the U.S.
plant we announced a couple months ago that's driven by a great opportunity we have in the U.S.
in the liquids area.
And so that's the kind of capital we like to invest.
It has high returns and will certainly be a positive for the sustainable cash flow both in the Nutrition business and the new Abbott in the future.
There is some moderate levels or I would even say modest levels of capital that we would be investing in some of our existing plants to improve our efficiency.
But again those will be the types of things that would have good financial returns rapid paybacks and would be well spent on behalf of shareholders.
So I think all of the news in Nutrition is good and we want to keep building on the success we've had so far.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then maybe Larry just thinking about HUMIRA I think most investors would have been surprised to see HUMIRA accelerate yet again here in the second quarter but that based on our math seems to be what you've done.
So if you think about maybe price being less of a tailwind in the second quarter it sort of implies that HUMIRA is either seeing greater share gains than we would have expected or just better general market growth for anti-TNFs.
Could you just help us understand what you think are the primary drivers of that sort of re-acceleration if pricing got a little softer incrementally? Sure.
Well if you look at the underlying trends you will see very strong growth for HUMIRA.
And so as I said in my remarks the fundamentals continue to support this level of growth.
There is a little bit of price as you mentioned in there.
But I think the key points for us really are in a couple of these larger portions of the market including dermatology which continues now to grow double digits.
We've actually seen a nice acceleration in that derm market over the last year or so.
Some of that is just our own commercial effort and execution.
Some of that is awareness of the products in the marketplace via advertising et cetera.
So I think that's become a pretty big component of our growth and we're gaining share there displacing the former product that was at the top.
We are now #1 here in the U.S.
in dermatology.
In the gastro space we continue to see very strong double-digit growth there as well with HUMIRA gaining share and growing faster than that market.
Again awareness of the disease and really just the overall strength of HUMIRA in gastro as well as dermatology really.
The results from the studies in both of those disease states position HUMIRA quite well relative to the competition.
I'd say rheumatology is growing well mid-single digits.
Obviously it's a more mature market but we see good share strength there for us as well with our growth outpacing the marketplace.
So I think it's really the 3 major components of that overall market Abbott's overall execution the product strength and I think it really points to the durability of that product longer term.
Research Division</strong> Okay just one more quickly maybe for John.
John you mentioned some comments about Vascular and where you think that franchise can be by the fourth quarter.
I just wonder do you think the U.S.
Vascular business can begin getting better in the third quarter? Or is that something we really should be thinking closer to the fourth? No we -- the fourth quarter was a comment about Diabetes Care specifically.
It'll definitely be getting modestly better as we go into the back half of the year.
And I think the main point there is what I talked about in terms of this being a royalty transition year with Promus revenues coming out of the mix so the non-commercial piece of it had an impact as well as FX.
And the trends are actually pretty good.
So if you look at what's happening there and even with the competitive launch of the product that I mentioned coming into the market XIENCE alone was only down about 2%.
And the latest share data that we've gotten in the last couple of days indicates that from May to June we've actually picked up a couple of share points in the U.S.
as well.
And as you know worldwide we continue to do very well with that product and the growth in particular in the emerging markets has been outstanding.
We also have a number of new products launching.
XIENCE PRIME in Japan just recently and then Xpedition will be coming with better deliverability in -- later in the year in the fourth quarter to your point and helping that business to improve.
And meanwhile on the bottom line the business is holding up quite well and doing well in terms of expanding margins.
Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just have a few questions.
Tom what was the impact of foreign exchange on the 300-basis-point improvement in gross margins? I don't recall foreign exchange being called out so much before and I just want to understand that.
Right.
Similar to the first quarter it was roughly half of the improvement.
I don't know -- those of you that follow us for a long time have seen quarters where exchange is a negative.
And throughout the first half of the year it's been about half of our margin improvement.
The rest has been executing on the gross margin improvement initiatives we've talked about in detail.
Research Division</strong> So you would expect then gross margins to further improve if currency has gotten worse correct? Well our guidance has factored in current exchange rates.
That's typically what we do.
We don't try to forecast changes.
But I think if rates were to hold at this level you'd see gross margins of the -- in line with our guidance that we've provided.
To your point though if the euro did weaken quite a bit yes you'd probably see a little bit more favorable gross margin but I'd personally rather have the sales stability and deliver gross margin improvement through our own initiatives.
Research Division</strong> And just if you could comment on what you're seeing in terms of European austerity measures.
I mean looking at your numbers it would appear that the currency has been obviously the biggest headwind to international sales.
But is there any way that you could quantify what you're seeing in terms of pricing dynamics tendering? J&amp;J certainly called that out yesterday on their conference call.
And if you're seeing any changes in terms of collectibles in some of the markets or receivables? And just my last question and it I think refers to an earlier question that was asked.
If we look at -- and again related to the cost of separating the 2 companies if I look across S&amp;P 500 and other precedent separations that have occurred it seems that the sort of typical costs that we see regarding additional corporate costs is around 2% of net sales.
Is that a fair assumption to make for Abbott? Or is -- are there differences that we should take into consideration? I understand you're not going to give that guidance but as we're starting to think about this is 2% of sales fair? That's a lot of questions.
I think I'll start on the receivables situation.
We saw during the quarter a significant improvement in Southern Europe.
Between the -- these governments are taking their situation seriously.
They've implemented austerity measures.
And in a couple markets in particular we saw really really strong payments in the quarter.
And so I think we feel very good about our business in Southern Europe and our ability to sustain that.
In terms of Europe generally maybe -- I guess it's the mix of our business.
While certainly it's not a big growth driver right now and in certain pockets in particular our Diabetes Care business we have felt a little bit of pressure from austerity when you look overall at Abbott it's been a fairly modest impact.
I think part of that is due to the quality of our products and the differentiation in the market and just basically the fundamental demand for them.
As we said a couple years ago we had a little more price than we'd typically have but that is largely normalized this year on the pharmaceuticals side of the business so I'd say that Europe from a demand perspective is a relatively modest matter for us at the current time.
Just on your question on headquarters costs again we'll talk about the modeling of these 2 companies in the fall and I just don't think it would be productive to talk about what other companies have done in this area at this time.
Research Division</strong> And just -- I'm sorry I just -- one last question.
Does your tax rate guidance assume the R&amp;D tax credit by the end of this year? No the -- as you know the credit is not operative this year so our guidance does not assume that.
Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> Two questions.
On the pharmaceutical guidance does that assume that -- particularly the third quarter guidance that you gave does that assume TriCor faces a generic competition? And if it does and there is no generics we've calculated that the impact would be favorable up to $0.05 so I don't know if that's in the ballpark.
But would you let that fall to the bottom line? Or would that be reinvested? And then I had a follow-up on stents.
Yes.
Just to talk about TriCor I mean as John and Larry talked about clearly the lipid space is very soft right now.
The branded products are down around 20 -- 29% 30% year-to-date.
And for us -- and we've identified these as mature franchises and we are definitely planning for generic competition in these areas.
And our guidance for the third quarter does assume generic competition because as you know there are competitors that have a right to launch at any time.
I've heard people talk about delays.
All I would say on that and you've kind of touched on it Glenn if there was a delay that's certainly something we can't count on and it is not something that's really meaningful -- would be meaningful beyond 2012 if it were to happen.
We need to plan for these products to basically be generic and we've talked about that in the fall.
So that's our planning assumption going forward.
And to your point if something was delayed we would very likely reinvest that back in the business because it really wouldn't be a sustainable benefit.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay and then just on the U.S.
stent business the competitor that you referenced it's the Medtronic stent Resolute.
Do you know whether or not we are now through the trialing period? It seems like maybe it is because John you referenced that you've recently picked up share gains so I'm wondering if the trialing period's ending there and now XIENCE is back in the position to recapture share.
And then do you have any market dynamics particularly in the U.S.
that you can share with us with respect to stent pricing DES penetration and PCI volume? Sure yes.
So to your first point yes it's hard to say that the trialing is over.
It's still relatively new but it is encouraging in terms of the recent trends that we've seen with the 2 major market share data services that we use.
We have picked up in June 2 to 3 share points depending on which service you use.
So that competitive product has picked up about 10 share points.
And we -- with the different products that we have launching and Xpedition coming and so forth there are a number of things there that we're encouraged about.
We're also -- we have picked up a couple of major share account wins recently and we have a number of plans in place with the team to compete against that.
And obviously with our depth of data and the deliverability and the overall profile of XIENCE we have clearly the best-in-class product here.
So we still hold the market leadership position in the U.S.
We do expect to regain share particularly as we go into the fourth quarter.
As we look at the market dynamics overall price has been -- it's encouraging.
The trend has been more low single-digit decline.
So it continues to moderate on a sequential basis.
So it's about the third quarter in a row of mid-single-digit-type year-over-year declines but moderating sequentially to low single digits on price.
So that's been encouraging.
Clearly outside of the U.S.
where -- it's a different situation.
PCI volume definitely impacted the overall market.
It was down about 5% in the U.S.
So despite that and the competitive entry that you mentioned XIENCE as I said before was only down about 2% in the U.S.
So that dynamic we expect hopefully to improve as we go into the back half of the year.
And DES penetration has been running around 79% recently.
LLC Research Division</strong> And just one follow-up.
The competitor launch which took 10 points is that continuing to move higher? Or has that kind of stabilized based on the...
It's stabilized and trending slightly downward.
And our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
Research Division</strong> My question was on the Vascular business.
I'm just wondering maybe you could talk about the margins for that business.
The margins are up this year despite the royalties going down.
And maybe you could talk about what the outlook for that and continued margin expansion there is especially given that I guess a significant portion of that is coming from emerging markets now and which I had thought might have been at a lower margin but maybe you could touch on that as well.
Sure.
The Vascular team has done a tremendous job in terms of operating more efficiently particularly in the manufacturing area and that's really helped blunt the impact of the Promus royalties on the margin ratio and the operating margin but that's really what the story is about.
The emerging market pricing is actually quite -- in a number of these markets is actually quite reasonable.
There tend to be multi-tier markets where some of the branded products you see in the developed world are -- there's a readiness to pay a premium.
And so the pricing actually is quite good in these markets and is really not a negative drag on the operating margin of the business.
I will say for Vascular it's got a good operating margin.
That team is looking to certainly continue to improve.
But relative to some of our other businesses it's in a reasonable range and I think you would see relatively modest incremental improvements from here as opposed to step changes.
Research Division</strong> That's helpful.
And if I could ask one follow-up on the EPD business.
It looks like there was a pretty nice improvement there from the second quarter to the first quarter.
Maybe if you could talk about austerity measures specifically on that business whether you've contemplated that whether you could envision that getting any worse.
And maybe just touch on what drove the improvement from the second quarter from the first quarter.
Well I think you've captured it properly that when we look at the EPD performance it's very good progress in line with what we've been talking about.
The growth rate is marching up towards that mid-single range which is what we'd been expecting for this year and what we expect in the second half.
And to remind everyone this is a business that when you weight out all the markets we're targeting mid-to-upper growth sustainably here and I think the progress you saw this quarter gives us a good feeling that that's achievable.
And hopefully as we progress through the year you'll -- we'll continue to build your confidence in that business with the sales growth in the third and fourth quarters.
I think the bigger -- the most important aspect of this business obviously is the emerging markets piece where demand continues to be strong.
And I think what we're starting to see is the execution starting to play out.
I mean this team has really only been in place effectively 1.5 years or so.
They're gelling quite nicely.
Their strategic plans are beginning to be implemented.
And I think we're just starting to see better execution in the field as we get the right people in place and deliver on the strategic plans.
And over time the developed markets will be a smaller part of this business and I think it'll -- as the emerging markets grows and I think that'll provide a nice growth boost as well.
Our next question is from Jeffrey Holford from Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I've got 3.
The first is on the gross margin.
Just on the actual operational efficiency gains for that can you just give us a bit more color on what divisions or products that's coming from? Well as we mentioned in our remarks the 3 big improvements in the quarter and you'll see this in the 10-Q when it comes out in the segment footnotes was Diagnostics where we're now above 20%.
Not many people would've thought that a few years ago.
Nutrition we saw about a 150-basis-point improvement over the prior year.
There are some seasonality effects in that business but we expect again a very -- a nice improvement for the full year in that business.
And the Vascular business we saw over 200 basis points of improvement in the quarter again from the types of things I talked about on the last question.
So those were the 3 big movers for the efficiency gains.
And even though it's a smaller business not to minimize it our Diabetes Care business which is a $1-billion business is also showing very nice margin improvement and John mentioned that in his remarks as well.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Then I was hoping you can comment on what level of buybacks were made during the quarter because maybe there were some share options exercised as well.
And just related to that also and if the group is doing it now in its capital allocation process which parts post-separation are more likely to do buybacks? Well we did around $600 million in buybacks in the second quarter.
That brings the year-to-date number to about $1.6 billion so we have been active there.
And similar to my other responses and I know we are getting close as we get into the fall here we'll be able to provide a lot more color on the companies.
But certainly as each talks about the intended uses of their cash flows whether it's dividend share buybacks or investments in the business the teams will cover those issues or those opportunities when we get into the fall.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And then just the last question is obviously you've got some exciting data coming in up in hep C in November.
During any of those studies or separate to those studies have you started doing any co-formulation work with any of the actives? And I don't suspect that you have yet but when will you start to look at co-formulation of some of those actives? You can assume that we have done a fair amount of work already in co-formulation...
With our own products you're talking about.
Right yes with the 3 products that we have in our development portfolio.
You can assume that's underway.
And our final question today is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
Research Division</strong> If I may go back to Vascular just a minute I'm very respectful of the comments you made around PCI volume for Q2.
But if I look back to the Q1 call you did forecast for Q2 despite FX and the royalty agreements that you would have high single digits.
So I'm curious if in fact Resolute coming to market had a greater short-term impact if you will than you might have expected.
And I have one follow-up.
Okay Tony this is John.
Yes I think it's fair to say it had a little bit more impact than we probably originally had forecasted.
Also PCI volume being down 5% was a factor as well.
But like I said the trend here recently is upward and the share count has -- or the share gains over the last month from May to June look promising.
There's also a number of initiatives that we're doing.
And as I said before in the response to another question we have recently won a couple of big accounts and that will factor in as we go through the rest of year.
The team is obviously very focused and execution will be important.
And we have every confidence that that team will take the challenge and they are already seeing the results of that in the latest data.
And in general I think there's a number of -- there's a cadence of products launching here that are pretty unique in terms of the timing and the overall attributes across all the segments of the Vascular business so in DES and Endovascular and our other carotid area and so forth we have a number of balloons guidewires new catheters Xpedition launching.
So generally we're very encouraged.
The U.S.
is improving.
x U.S.
we continue to do well and I mentioned double-digit growth in the emerging markets in my commentary.
So overall it's a pretty good story and the bottom line impact on the businesses is what we've been talking about a lot and that obviously has been very good.
And Tom mentioned that 200-basis-point improvement so we're working on it.
Research Division</strong> And then finally the direct distribution model for which Nutritionals is switching could you perhaps provide a timeline when you believe that will be fully implemented? And then lastly if you are to split apart on January 1 if we assume that do you actually host a Q4 call in January on the consolidated business? What was your first question Tony? Research Division</strong> Yes it was really on the direct distribution model in Nutritionals.
When do you fully believe that will be implemented? Yes the key thing there is this is a selective program.
It's only certain markets.
It's not -- we're already direct in a number of markets and in certain markets it makes sense for us to continue to work through distributors so it's only selected markets.
The vast majority of that should play through this year.
There's probably a modest amount in 2013 and we had a fair amount of it in the second quarter here.
So I think it's really important to just keep in mind that this is a -- only select markets and the majority will play through this year.
And you mentioned the Q4 call...
Research Division</strong> On the Q4 call.
That is a good question and it's a unique situation for us as well and we'll be talking that through with the management team.
Obviously if this timing plays out the way I outlined on the call it will be kind of a unique period of time when the report will be on the total company.
But clearly investors will be focused on the future 2013 and it'll clearly be necessary for both management teams to be talking about that.
So the exact way we structure it has not been determined but we are talking about that and we should have some answers for you in the coming months.
Yes.
And lastly Tony I'd say -- just I wanted to mention this and I forgot to on your question about Vascular.
Just remember that when you exclude the Promus royalty transition which is this year and obviously will improve going forward into 2013 if you exclude that situation and FX the underlying business there grew in the mid-single digits globally.
And so I think we're pretty pleased with that overall.
Actually let me just remind everybody of the replay sorry about that.
The replay of the call will be available after 11 Central Time today on our website at abbottinvestor.com and after 11 Central via telephone at (402) 220-9697.
The confirmation code is 3458.
The audio replay will be available until 4 Central on Wednesday August 1.
Again thanks everybody for joining us today.
Thank you.
And this concludes today's conference.
You may disconnect at this time.
Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.
With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr.
John Thomas Vice President Investor Relations and Public Affairs.
Good morning and thanks for joining us.
Today we'll discuss our third quarter ongoing earnings results as well as provide new information regarding the separation of Abbott's proprietary Pharmaceutical business into a new independent company called AbbVie.
Joining me on today's call is Miles White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Abbott; Tom Freyman Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Abbott; Rick Gonzalez who will become Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of AbbVie; Bill Chase who will become Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer of AbbVie; and Laura Schumacher who will be Executive Vice President and General Counsel of AbbVie and head of a number of corporate functions including Licensing and Acquisitions External Affairs and Investor Relations.
Also joining on today's call is Brian Yoor who will become the new Head of Investor Relations of Abbott post separation.
Brian has been with Abbott in numerous financial roles for 15 years most recently as Controller of our diagnostics division.
Larry Peepo who is also on today's call will remain Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations at Abbott.
I will be moving over to AbbVie to head Investor Relations and Public Affairs.
Today Miles will begin with an update on the separation as well as our outlook for the new Abbott.
Tom will provide a brief overview of our third quarter performance and then provide some additional context for how we're planning to launch 2 new independent companies in January of next year including their respective capital structures as well as annual dividends.
They'll also provide some additional detail on our 2013 for the new Abbott.
Following Miles Tom and Rick we'll provide an overview of AbbVie and its future outlook and Bill will cover AbbVie's third quarter results and provide some further context on 2013.
Following our comments as we normally do we'll take any questions that you might have.
Before we get started some statements may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the planned separation of the research-based pharmaceutical company from the diversified medical products company and the expected financial results of the 2 companies after the separation.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and there's no assurance as to the timing of the planned separation or whether it will be completed.
Economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2011 and the interim reports filed on form 10-Q for subsequent quarterly periods.
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments.
In today's conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
And with that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles? Okay.
Thanks John.
Good morning.
One year ago this week we announced the most significant transformational event in Abbott's 125-year history our decision to separate into 2 leading public health care companies with completely new and unique investment identities.
So today in addition to reviewing our third quarter earnings we're going to give you some additional insight into what these 2 companies will look like going forward beginning in 2013.
With regard to our third quarter results Abbott delivered another quarter of strong performance with ongoing earnings per share growth of more than 10%.
In addition to generating strong operating results we are continuing to prepare for separation.
We've completed a significant amount of work since last October and both companies are ready to operate independently beginning January 1.
Over the past year we've taken a number of steps to prepare AbbVie to become a new company.
We've named the leadership team designating several senior leaders who will move from Abbott to AbbVie which will complement the strong commercial and operational leaders who are currently part of our proprietary pharmaceutical business.
As we announced last year Rick Gonzalez will become AbbVie's Chairman and CEO.
Rick has more than 30 years of Abbott experience and has been Executive Vice President of our global pharmaceuticals business for the last 2 years.
Laura Schumacher Abbott's current Executive Vice President and General Counsel and a more than 20-year Abbott veteran will lead that function at AbbVie as well as a number of corporate functions including Licensing and Acquisitions External Affairs and Investor Relations.
And Bill Chase who is currently Vice President of Licensing and Acquisitions at Abbott will become AbbVie's CFO.
Bill has been at Abbott for more than 20 years also serving as Corporate Treasurer and the Controller of the International Pharmaceutical Division.
We've also continued to strengthen AbbVie's mid- and late-stage pipeline since our separation announcement last year and we've seen impressive progress from later-stage development programs such as Hepatitis C which you heard a little bit about earlier this week.
In addition to an advancing pipeline we understand that investors do seek a positive return while that pipeline continues to progress.
As you know AbbVie generates robust cash flow and is committed to returning cash to shareholders.
AbbVie is expected to pay a strong attractive dividend which Tom and Bill will discuss in more detail later in the call.
So the separation we announced 1 year ago is nearing completion and our shareholders will soon benefit from 2 fundamentally different investment opportunities with distinct strategic profiles and business priorities.
The AbbVie Form 10 has provided some perspective on the pre-separation financial profile of AbbVie and a Form 10 amendment filed last month outlined the AbbVie capital structure and pro forma interest expense.
We recognize that investors and analysts need more information to help them model both companies separately.
So as the next step of this process today we'll provide some additional information on separation-related aspects of the AbbVie P&amp;L including the tax rate interest expense and costs for AbbVie to run as an independent company.
We'll also provide some other aspects of the P&amp;L profile for both companies.
Although it's too soon for a specific 2013 EPS guidance our intent is to help you establish a baseline for both companies each of which will have a different profile after the separation.
Tom and Bill will cover the profiles for the 2 companies in their remarks.
We've structured both companies for future success and have taken the actions necessary to support the unique attributes of each company.
AbbVie will be a large cap biopharmaceutical company with a number of differentiated growth brands including a sustainable biologic HUMIRA and a compelling pipeline.
It generates significant cash flow and will have the appropriate capital structure to support strong returns for shareholders including a strong dividend.
As you know I will continue to serve as Chairman and CEO of Abbott so let me take a few minutes now to provide some brief comments on what the new Abbott will look like in the future.
As of the 1st of next year Abbott will be one of the largest diversified health care products companies in the industry.
It will be comprised of 4 roughly equal-sized businesses: nutritionals established pharmaceuticals medical devices and diagnostics all competing in large markets and aligned with favorable long-term health care trends.
Our pipeline includes transformational medical technologies next generation diagnostic systems new formulations new packaging new flavors and other brand enhancements.
Our geographic mix is very well balanced with one of the largest emerging market revenue bases of any large cap health company.
With leadership positions across this portfolio expanding margins and strong cash flow Abbott will be well positioned among its peers to deliver top-tier growth.
We've made a number of important strides in 2012 to continue to position Abbott for long-term growth launching our bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB in Europe parts of Asia and Latin America; breaking ground on manufacturing plants in India and China; completing 60 launches year-to-date across our nutrition business around the world; consistently driving above-market growth in core diagnostics; and implementing a number of geographic and product expansion initiatives in the established pharmaceuticals division just to name a few.
At the same time it's well recognized that all of us are managing through a difficult business environment.
Like other multinationals that have a significant global presence we've been impacted by a slowing global economy both in the developed world as well as in emerging markets.
In particular we saw pricing and market pressures in Europe impact our businesses more significantly this quarter.
Foreign currency has also been a headwind on sales throughout the year.
This resulted in somewhat lower Abbott sales growth than originally anticipated yet we continue to deliver on our financial commitments.
While we face the same market environmental challenges as our health care peers we've structured Abbott to have the right portfolio of businesses and geographic diversity to take advantage of favorable trends ahead of us in health care.
So as we look to 2013 and beyond let me walk you through our long-term growth strategies to provide additional insights on how the new Abbott will generate growth over the next several years.
I'll begin with nutrition which produces tremendous cash flow and a high return on invested capital.
We're a leader in global nutrition participating in a compelling growth market that's approximately $35 billion today expected to exceed $50 billion by 2016.
It's driven by favorable demographics such as an aging population and the underpenetration of nutritional products given the increasing rate of chronic diseases as well as the rise of the emerging market middle class.
Our long-term strategy in nutrition is to drive strong top line growth by building our product portfolio with a steady rhythm of innovative differentiated new product launches expanding aggressively in key high-growth emerging markets and leveraging our #1 global position in adult nutrition to grow and further penetrate the market.
At the same time we plan to significantly improve our gross and operating margins.
We've made good progress in the U.S.
year-to-date.
We've continued to drive double-digit growth of our key pediatric and adult nutritionals by refreshing and improving our brands with products like PediaSure Clear Similac with Lutein Ensure Clear and Glucerna Hunger Smart.
Outside of the U.S.
we're investing in the product pipeline and the infrastructure including state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in China and India to drive share gains in key markets.
China is the world's largest pediatric nutritional market at more than $7 billion and it's expected to grow rapidly over the next 5 years.
We have ample opportunity to improve our share position in this market and others.
And finally the global adult nutrition market is expanding as the world's population ages life expectancy increases and the unfortunate incidence of age-related diseases rises.
Our global leadership position in adult nutrition is a clear competitive advantage as we further develop and shape this market.
In addition to driving sales growth we're improving how we do business in nutrition so that it's more profitable.
We expect to improve our operating margin from the low teens in 2011 to our target of more than 20% by 2015.
This is something that we've successfully achieved in diagnostics and we're showing good progress now in nutrition.
We're reducing raw material and packaging costs improving manufacturing processes and building more efficient plants closer to our customers simplifying our distribution and ensuring the products customers and markets that we invest in are profitable.
In 2012 we expect to deliver approximately 200 basis points of expansion in our nutrition operating margin.
We're confident in our ability to deliver on our longer-term objective as we've implemented a number of our planned actions in 2012 and we expect to continue our progress in 2013.
In our established pharmaceuticals division home to our branded generics business we're generating international sales from a large and growing portfolio of hundreds of products that have broad use throughout the world.
EPD is more like our nutrition business than it is Proprietary Pharmaceuticals.
It has a development organization that moves fast to refresh and improve key brands and it markets products to customers in the developing world who typically pay out of product -- out of pocket for their health care.
In many of these markets despite the expiration of patents product growth is sustained by brand equity which is established by customer trust in products that are reliably supplied of high-quality affordable and tailored to the needs of each market.
EPD is a relatively new organization within Abbott in place for less than 2 years now where we have a number of early-stage geographic and product expansion initiatives now under way.
Our long-term growth strategy is to increase the breadth of our product offerings by launching new and improved formulations and registering products across multiple geographies reinforce our position in the developed markets through portfolio expansion and accelerate and capture new sources of growth by targeting faster growing emerging markets where we have strong positions.
In fact operational sales growth in key BRIC markets which comprise more than 1/3 of EPD sales increased nearly 20% year-to-date.
While austerity measures have negatively impacted EPD sales in Europe as faster growing emerging markets become a larger percentage of EPD's sales base we expect to see improving growth for EPD to achieve our long-term target of mid- to high single-digit sales growth.
Next I'll cover medical devices which includes our Diabetes Care Vision Care and Vascular businesses.
In Diabetes Care we're advancing our new product pipeline with products such as FreeStyle InsuLinx with the goal of simplifying the glucose testing process and we've improved operating margin with a shift to more profitable channels and customers streamlining of our manufacturing better sales force execution and more efficient SG&amp;A spending.
In Vision Care we are leaders in the refractive segment and #2 in cataract.
Our cataract business is the largest most profitable and fastest-growing of our Vision Care businesses.
We are launching new products to continue to grow our share in this segment as well as capture growth in countries such as India and China where we're introducing new products tailored to these specific markets.
And in Vascular our growth franchise -- our growth strategy is focused on expanding our leadership positions across our 3 business segments: Coronary Structural Heart and Endovascular.
This includes targeting emerging markets where interventional procedures are growing double digits driven by an aging population with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease.
Penetration rates in emerging markets are also much lower than the developed world and have the potential to significantly expand with increased awareness and improved treatment of heart disease.
Emerging markets comprise more than 20% of Vascular sales and on an operational basis have increased 20% year-to-date.
In our Coronary segment we're focus on expanding our global drug-eluting stent leadership position.
This year we've launched XIENCE PRIME in Japan and XIENCE Xpedition in Europe.
Xpedition combines the impressive safety and efficacy of XIENCE PRIME and sets a new standard for deliverability.
We are on track to launch Xpedition in the U.S.
early next year.
In September we launched in Europe and other international markets ABSORB our BBS technology or bioabsorbable technology that acts like a drug-eluting stent but unlike a metallic stent has the added benefit of slowly absorbing over time much like sutures do after a wound heals.
The result is a vessel that can naturally flex and pull similar to an untreated one.
ABSORB puts Abbott in a unique position to offer the only technology of this kind.
In our Structural Heart business MitraClip is an example of how Abbott is pushing the transcatheter valve market forward with a first of a kind technology.
MitraClip can have a dramatic impact for many of the hundreds of thousands of patients who experience a diminished quality of life from significant mitral regurgitation which is the leaking of the heart's mitral valve.
It's on the market in Europe and we're working to bring it to other markets around the world including the U.S.
It has significant long-term potential given the number of patients who go untreated today.
And finally our Endovascular segment represents a significant opportunity for growth.
We're applying our expertise in developing best-in-class coronary devices to the faster growing endovascular market.
Today Abbott's underpenetrated in this market that's growing at a high single-digit rate.
We expect growth in this segment to improve with numerous new product launches and new indications over the next several years.
We're also evaluating our bioabsorbable technology for use in the periphery.
The last of our 4 major segments is diagnostics where year-to-date operational sales growth is in excess of 7% and operating margin continues to improve.
Our relevant global in vitro diagnostics market is very large at nearly $30 billion.
While diagnostics comprised less than 5% of hospital costs their findings influence the majority of health care decision making.
Abbott is well positioned with global leadership in the largest segment immunoassay diagnostics.
We've successfully improved cash flow generation and profitability in our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business and have now refocused our long-term growth strategy on the top line as well.
We're leveraging our global leadership position to capture growth in emerging markets.
One of the largest opportunity is China a nearly $2 billion market that's growing roughly 20%.
We've been consistently growing near double the market pace as we expand our share.
We're delivering customized solutions that deliver results more efficiently and we're launching next generation platforms over the next few years.
We haven't seen market-changing innovation in diagnostics in more than a decade and we expect to lead this effort as we expand our product portfolio significantly.
Molecular and Point of Care Diagnostics round out our diverse portfolio of diagnostics offerings.
These businesses allow us to develop solutions for newly identified disease targets predict patient outcomes and perform bedside testing to accelerate treatment decisions.
We're growing both businesses as we increase penetration of systems and tests and expand in emerging markets.
Margin improvement has been and continues to be a key focus in diagnostics.
From 2007 to 2011 we improved our operating margin from 8% of sales to more than 18% of sales more than doubling the operating margin in dollar terms.
Our long-term goal had been to exceed 20% of sales by 2015.
We're ahead of schedule in our progress toward this goal as we continue to expand the gross and operating margin profile of our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business.
Year-to-date diagnostics' operating margin is more than 19% of sales and we now expect to well exceed our long-term target over the next several years.
So in summary over the last 12 months we've prepared both Abbott and AbbVie to be successful independent companies come January 1.
AbbVie will be well positioned within its pharmaceutical peer group with a strong dividend and an advancing late-stage pipeline that's getting increased visibility and that's certainly evidenced by the very strong HCV data released earlier this week.
The new Abbott will be one of the largest diversified health care investment opportunities and over the long term one of the fastest growing.
But like all multinationals we're managing through a more difficult economic environment now.
And this year we're making a number of business transitions that put Abbott in a better position going forward.
This includes working through the decline in Promus revenues initiating a number of geographic and product expansion initiatives in EPD and simplifying our nutritional supply chain.
We're making good progress on all fronts.
As we look to the future we see tremendous opportunity ahead.
Our business the majority of them in leadership positions are aligned with favorable demographics that will be driving growth in health care.
We are well balanced geographically including a broad base of customers many in emerging markets where income levels are rising and socioeconomic conditions are vastly improving.
And we'll maintain Abbott's financial heritage with robust cash flow generation upwards of $4 billion and significant opportunity for further operating margin expansion.
All told the new Abbott will be well positioned among its peers to deliver top-tier growth.
So now let me turn the call over to Tom who will provide a brief overview of Abbott's third quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of the year.
He'll also cover key financial aspects of the separation including capital structure and dividend for both companies and 2013 financial profile information for new Abbott.
Tom? Thanks Miles.
Today we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.30 an increase of 10.2% over the prior year and above our previous guidance range.
Sales for the quarter increased 4.1% on an operational basis which was more than offset by an unfavorable 4.5% impact from exchange rates.
As we saw last quarter there continues to be a significant impact from exchange on top line results.
Emerging markets remained a significant growth contributor with sales in the quarter of $2.6 billion an increase of more than 10% on an operational basis.
Regarding sales for what will become the new Abbott businesses there have been 2 factors that are transitional in nature that have impacted growth trends.
The first is the decline in the Promus-related revenue and our Vascular businesses as we no longer provide products under the previous distribution agreement.
And the second is the shift to direct distribution in certain international nutrition markets as part of our gross margin improvement initiative.
Excluding these transitional factors a new Abbott operational sales growth is in the mid-single digits year-to-date.
We saw a continued improvement in the adjusted gross margin to 63.8% in the quarter up 340 basis points from the prior year.
Half of this improvement was due to exchange while the other half resulted from the various margin improvement initiatives we're implementing across our businesses.
Year-to-date we've seen our adjusted gross margin ratio increase 310 basis points over the prior year with nearly half of this improvement driven by the effect of the changes in foreign exchange rates on the ratio.
Again the remainder of this improvement resulted from our margin improvement initiatives.
Those of you who have followed our results over the years know that the extreme volatility in exchange rates has both positively and negatively impacted the adjusted gross margin ratio depending on the year by as much as a full percentage point or more.
You may recall that 2010 was favorably impacted 2011 negatively impacted and we are again seeing a favorable effect this year through 3 quarters.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter we expect this trend to reverse with exchange negatively impacting the ratio by as much as a full percentage point.
As we see things today we'd expect this trend to continue into next year with exchange negatively impacting the gross margin ratio for both Abbott and AbbVie.
Turning to our full year 2012 outlook.
We're narrowing our ongoing earnings per share guidance range to $5.06-$5.08 reflecting growth of 8.8% at the midpoint.
This 2012 guidance continues to reflect a full year outlook for the company in total as the separation is expected to be effective January 1.
We're pleased with our overall performance this year delivering ongoing earnings per share growth ahead of our original guidance provided back in January despite the challenging global economy and currency headwinds affecting sales.
Regarding the fourth quarter we expect reported sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits which includes an estimated negative 1% impact in foreign exchange.
Both our fourth quarter sales forecast and EPS expectations for the year assume that a generic TriCor enters the market in the fourth quarter.
We expect a gross margin ratio of around 63% including the exchange effect discussed earlier.
As we are now further along in our separation process as Miles indicated today we're in a position to give you some more information regarding  certain aspects of the financial profiles of new Abbott and AbbVie once separated.
While we're providing this additional information today I'd again note that it's too early in the process for either company to provide EPS guidance for 2013.
Between now and January we'll continue our usual planning process.
While the profile information we'll provide for each company today could change somewhat over the coming months each company will be ready by its fourth quarter earnings conference call to provide more specific details of its 2013 outlook including EPS guidance.
Those forecasts will reflect the latest assumptions on business and economic factors including foreign exchange.
As we previously indicated the primary rationale for the separation is the fact that these 2 businesses have evolved differently and as a result they have different investment identities.
These differences are broad and deep and they affect how each company plans to structure and run its business going forward.
So let me start with dividend policy.
The dividend has always been an important component of Abbott's investment identity.
We had previously indicated that we expected the combined dividend of the 2 companies to be at least equal to Abbott's pre-separation annual dividend.
And we expect AbbVie to be even more focused on shareholder returns in the form of dividends paying a larger portion of the dividend.
With this in mind today we're announcing that we expect AbbVie to pay an annual dividend of $1.60 per share starting with the quarterly dividend to be paid in February.
This like all dividends will be subject to approval by the future AbbVie board in January 2013.
We're also announcing that we expect the new Abbott dividend to be $0.56 per share in line with its peer group and growth prospects again starting with the dividend to be paid in February and again subject to approval by the Abbott board.
In the end this combined annual dividend rate of $2.16 for the 2 companies exceeds the current annual dividend rate of $2.04.
And this increase is expected to be implemented 1 quarter earlier than in past years.
Regarding debt and related interest expense as Miles indicated last month we provided the pro forma capital structure for AbbVie and an amendment to the Form 10.
Consistent with our previous commentary the pre-separation debt has been apportioned roughly in line with each company's share of the pre-separation cash flows after dividend and capital expenditures.
As a reminder this rebalancing of the debt will be accomplished by the following actions.
First AbbVie is expected to raise just under $16 billion in total debt.
Second AbbVie will provide a net cash distribution to Abbott of around $8.5 billion.
And finally Abbott will use the proceeds of that distribution to execute a tender for a portion of its debt outstanding and to pay down a portion of its commercial paper outstanding.
As a result the new Abbott expects to carry approximately $7.5 billion in debt as of the separation date consisting of long-term debt commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.
Abbott expects to have around $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet post separation.
As detailed in our earnings news release today and as discussed last quarter as a result of the low interest rate environment we expect one-time charges to be incurred in the fourth quarter related to the debt extinguishment cost driven by higher interest rates on the existing bonds compared to the rates currently prevailing.
The resulting capital structure of each company will determine ongoing interest expense for each going forward.
For new Abbott net interest will be driven by its remaining debt outstanding including the impact of existing interest rate swaps partially offset by interest earned on cash balances.
As you know interest earned today on cash is very low.
As a result we're forecasting net interest expense of a little more than $100 million in 2013 for new Abbott.
Bill will discuss the outlook for AbbVie's net interest expense in a few minutes.
Regarding taxes we believe that the tax rate for new Abbott will be approximately 21.5% in 2013.
We will need to see what if any congressional actions may occur at the end of the year or the early part of 2013 to determine our final estimate for the tax rate.
Regarding AbbVie as an independent company focused on returns to shareholders management plans to establish an appropriate balance across its global cash flows to provide maximum flexibility.
As a result we expect an ongoing tax rate of around 22% for AbbVie.
While this rate is above the historical average for this business it's reflective of a shift in emphasis from investing in successful x-U.S.
growth opportunities in the past to a stronger emphasis on shareholder returns going forward.
This rate will support AbbVie's strong dividend policy.
We're also in a position at this time to clarify the profile of some other line items of the new Abbott P&amp;L.
Bill will discuss AbbVie's profile in a few minutes.
As we see our 2013 sales outlook today for the new Abbott we expect reported sales of roughly $23 billion based on today's exchange rate.
This would reflect growth in the mid to high single digits over where we expect to end 2012.
Regarding the gross margin for new Abbott for modeling purposes today we're forecasting a ratio of roughly 55% excluding noncash amortization reflecting underlying business trends and the expected impact of foreign exchange rates on the ratio I mentioned earlier.
I'll discuss how we expect to report noncash amortization expense going forward in a moment.
We expect R&amp;D investment for new Abbott that's in line with the investment needs of our various businesses which averages out between 6% and 7% of sales.
We expect the SG&amp;A ratio to be around 30% of sales for new Abbott again in line with the competitive profiles of our various businesses with ongoing efficiency efforts to generate SG&amp;A leverage over time.
Our outlook for SG&amp;A includes an estimated impact from the medical device tax under the U.S.
Affordable Care Act that begins in 2013.
Finally we would expect minimal nonoperating income and roughly $30 million of loss in the exchange gain/loss line of the P&amp;L in a typical year.
Before I turn it over to Rick and Bill for their thoughts on AbbVie let me discuss a change in our reporting for next year regarding noncash amortization that will affect both companies.
As you know Abbott has historically recorded noncash amortization expense as part of cost of goods sold and included it in our non-GAAP ongoing earnings per share metric.
This expense has well exceeded $1 billion annually in recent years as we've completed several strategic acquisitions that have reshaped Abbott.
The majority of this noncash amortization approximately $850 million or $0.42 a share in 2013 relates to new Abbott.
Going forward cash EPS that is ongoing EPS excluding the impact of noncash amortization is a more meaningful metric meaningful non-GAAP metric for assessing new Abbott's earnings power and growth.
This is particularly true as amortization expense begins to decline in the coming years.
So beginning with the guidance to be provided for 2013 by January of next year new Abbott is expected to provide ongoing earnings per share guidance on a cash basis.
As a result we will remove amortization from cost of goods sold starting in 2013 in order to calculate the adjusted gross margin ratio.
We will of course also continue to reconcile this guidance to EPS on a GAAP basis which would include amortization expense and specified items.
AbbVie plans to use a similar cash EPS approach as it begins to report independently next year which Bill will cover in more detail in a few minutes.
So with that let me turn the call over to Rick for an overview of the prospects of AbbVie followed by Bill who will review the third quarter results for Proprietary Pharmaceuticals as well as the financial profile for AbbVie.
Rick? Thanks Tom.
It's a pleasure to have the opportunity this morning to discuss our strategic vision and outlook for AbbVie.
As Miles mentioned since the separation announcement 1 year ago we have been focused on delivering strong performance in 2012 as well as preparing to operate as an independent company.
I'm pleased to say we're succeeding on both fronts.
Our research-based pharmaceutical business is delivering another strong year with year-to-date operational sales growth of 8%.
We're ready to begin as a new company on January 1.
January 2 will be our first official day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ABBV.
Between now and then we will continue to actively reach out together with Abbott to the investment community at large through our roadshows our meetings and our other communications.
Our goal is to help investors better understand our distinct investment identity.
Today we have an opportunity to begin that dialogue.
First it's important to understand that AbbVie is not a traditional pharmaceutical company.
AbbVie will blend the stability global scale resources and commercial capabilities of a pharmaceutical company with the focus culture and agility of a biotech creating a unique biopharmaceutical company.
At launch AbbVie will have a number of strengths and attributes that will position us well for continued success when we begin trading as an independent company.
These characteristics include a track record of outstanding operating performance; a specialty-focused commercial portfolio with numerous market-leading differentiated therapies; foremost among them is HUMIRA which will continue to be a significant driver of growth for AbbVie; a strong financial foundation with annual operating cash flow of approximately $6 billion; a commitment to return cash to shareholders including an attractive $1.60 annualized dividend which will be recommended for approval by the AbbVie board and a commitment to grow that dividend; a compelling late-stage pipeline with several assets that have billion-dollar-plus peak revenue opportunities including HCV; and an advancing mid-stage pipeline that includes key assets with compelling proof-of-concept human clinical data.
Finally we have a strong experienced and highly committed leadership team to drive AbbVie's continued success.
Before Bill discusses some financial considerations for 2013 I'd like to provide a high-level perspective on our unique product portfolio and our advancing late-stage pipeline.
I'll start with our current product portfolio which includes a balance of differentiated growth brands as well as sustainable performers.
We compete in markets that offer significant growth potential and we hold strong category leadership positions in our therapeutic segments.
Certainly HUMIRA remains the cornerstone of our portfolio and is a strong driver for AbbVie and will remain so.
Not many brands are able to achieve and sustain the level of performance we've demonstrated with HUMIRA.
Clearly HUMIRA has a strong clinical profile.
But our commercial our development and our regulatory execution on HUMIRA have been outstanding.
HUMIRA's performance continues to be exceptional as evidenced by the strong double-digit growth this year.
Several factors are driving that performance.
First strong patient demand has led to global market share gains in both dermatology and gastroenterology.
Second the addition of 2 new indications for patients: UC here in the U.S.
and Europe as well as axial SpA in Europe.
HUMIRA now treats a total of 8 approved indications and 4 more are in late-stage development.
Finally the global biologic market growth remains strong and HUMIRA continues to outpace that growth.
We expect HUMIRA demand to continue to grow given the relative modest biologic penetration rates across all market segments but in particular the dermatology segment where biological penetration rates are still mid-single digits.
And while much has been said about the potential changes in the competitive landscape in the coming years we plan for these factors.
We continue to have a high level of confidence in HUMIRA given its extensive clinical track record strong product profile and proven clinical performance.
HUMIRA is clearly important to the AbbVie story and we will focus on growing and protecting this market-leading brand.
But our portfolio includes a mix of differentiated growth plans sustainable performers and a handful of maturing products that we will transition through over the next few years.
Within this mix we continue to hold market leadership positions across numerous therapeutic categories.
For example Lupron is the leading hormonal therapy for palliative treatment for prostate cancer.
Synthroid is the #1 branded synthetic hormone therapy for thyroid disease and one of the most widely prescribed products in the U.S.
AndroGel has strong leadership position in the growing testosterone replacement market.
CREON is the leading pancreatic enzyme therapy for conditions associated with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis.
And Kaletra and Norvir remain leading antiviral medicines for the treatment of HIV.
AbbVie is focused on maximizing the performance of each and every product in our commercial portfolio.
We've structured our specialty sales force for efficiency and agility and we will leverage our competitive advantage and capitalize on the market dynamics.
This includes continued geographic expansion where we expect to add approximately $1 billion in incremental sales over the next 5 years from emerging markets.
In addition to sustaining our position within the industry as a proven commercial leader with a strong track record of execution our goal will be to further shape AbbVie into an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company.
To that end we will continue to invest in R&amp;D at a rate of approximately 14% of sales next year.
As I discussed last October we're extremely encouraged with the progress of our new product pipeline.
We will launch with numerous medicines in mid- and late-stage development that have truly breakthrough potential.
All told across our emerging pipeline we have 30 compounds in human clinical trials; 15 biologic compounds across several therapeutic areas; 6 ongoing Phase III programs including several that represent billion-dollar-plus potential; 4 new HUMIRA indications currently in Phase III development which collectively add significant new growth opportunity for HUMIRA; and 10 compounds or new indications in mid-stage development including several that will advance to Phase III within the next 18 months.
We're focused on delivering truly innovation -- innovative medicines to address the most pressing areas of unmet clinical need.
Although we don't have time today to detail the entire pipeline for you I'll briefly discuss some of the interesting mid-stage and late-stage compounds we have in development.
Let me start with our mid-stage pipeline.
There are 10 active programs several with strong proof-of-concept data.
I'll highlight 3 promising assets poised to move into Phase III over the next 18 months.
ABT-199 our next generation Bcl inhibitor which has shown strong activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
We will present additional data in upcoming medical meeting and we expect to initiate Phase III in 2013.
ABT-719 our novel investigational compound for the prevention of acute kidney injury.
It's currently in Phase IIb development and is expected to enter Phase III next year.
ABT-126 our alpha 7 agonist currently in Phase IIb trials for Alzheimer's and schizophrenia.
We expect to present Phase II data next year and start Phase III mid-2014.
Now let me turn to our late-stage pipeline which also includes 10 compounds or indications in Phase III development.
As I mentioned earlier we have 4 new HUMIRA indications currently in Phase III trial.
Several of these will be unique to the HUMIRA label and will help us further differentiate HUMIRA from competitive products.
Daclizumab is our next-generation biologic in development with Biogen for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
Results from 1 of the 2 pivotal trials demonstrated strong efficacy and disability performance.
Results from the Phase III study which recently completed enrollment are expected in 2014.
Bardoxolone is a compound in development with our partner Reata for the treatment of chronic kidney disease a growing market with few treatment options.
The Phase III study which is an outcomes trial is now fully enrolled.
Elagolix is a compound in development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids.
It has a unique profile with the potential to provide symptom reduction while avoiding significant bone loss or other adverse effects that sometimes can be associated with this therapy.
And Duopa is a therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease.
We recently completed our Phase III registrational program and we're on track to complete our U.S.
registrational submission by year end.
Finally turning to our HCV program where we are making significant clinical progress.
We continue to have a high level of confidence that AbbVie has the potential to achieve a strong leadership position in this space.
As I stated previously our goal is to bring to market a potent well-tolerated easy-to-administer treatment that delivers very high cure rates without interferon.
Data to date confirm that we're on target.
Earlier this week we released top line Phase IIb data from our Aviator trial the most comprehensive set of interferon-free combination data in genotype 1 patients available to date.
Results in patients who have reached post-treatment week 12 show that our 12-week regiment which includes all 3 assets in our HCV portfolio plus ribavirin produce 99% SVR12 or cure rate in naïve patients and 93% SVR12 in previous null responding patients.
Additionally SVR12 rates for the other 8- and 12-week programs in the study range from 89% to 92%.
Importantly all combinations were very well tolerated with an overall rate of drug-related discontinuations of less than 2%.
By way of comparison current oral antivirals paired with ribavirin and interferon for either 24 or 48 weeks produced SVR12s in approximately 75% of treatment naïve patients and just over 30% of previous null responding patients.
So our results suggest a very compelling improvement over standard of care achieved without the use of interferon and with just 12 weeks of therapy.
While we're somewhat limited in how much we can discuss prior to the data presentation next month I will say that we're very impressed by the Aviator results.
The data demonstrates that our approach of validated and larger confirmatory Phase III trials represents a significant advance in patient care.
Today we're pleased to announce that we recently initiated our comprehensive genotype 1 registrational program with the start of our first Phase III study.
We're on track to begin the remaining Phase III studies in the coming weeks.
This global registrational program includes the study of naïve and experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection as well as certain special populations.
We will evaluate 3 direct-acting antivirals with and without ribavirin for 4 weeks -- or 12 weeks in genotype 1 patients.
As a reminder genotype 1 represents the most prevalent patient type in developed markets including approximately 70% of patients here in the U.S.
Our Phase III triple DAA cocktail will include a co-formulated 2-tablet therapy containing our protease inhibitor ABT-450; and our NS5 inhibitor ABT-267 administered once a day; plus our polymerase inhibitor ABT-333 which is one tablet administered twice a day.
We will evaluate it both with and without ribavirin.
We're also conducting additional exploratory clinical trials to determine if a once-daily ribavirin-free co-formulated treatment of ABT-450 and 267 can provide high cure rates in specific HCV populations providing an avenue for further simplification.
The timing of our registrational study supports commercialization in early 2015 putting us in a strong competitive position.
It is our goal to be the first to market on an interferon-free therapy for genotype 1 patients.
So in summary we have an excellent foundation for AbbVie.
We have a strong base of sustainable leadership positions across our specialty-focused commercial portfolio including HUMIRA which will continue to drive significant growth; a compelling late-stage pipeline including several programs with billion-dollar-plus potential; a strong and experienced management team; a solid financial foundation including strong profitability and robust cash flow; and a commitment to return cash to shareholders including a strong dividend.
With that I'll turn the call over to Bill Chase who will be AbbVie's Chief Financial Officer for additional information on our expected financial profile in 2013.
Bill? Thanks Rick.
It's a pleasure to be here this morning and to have the opportunity to be part of the AbbVie team.
To Rick's remarks you should now have a good understanding of how we're viewing the broader identity of AbbVie.
I'd like to take a few moments to expand on this from my financial standpoint.
I'll also provide some color on our third quarter results and then discuss certain aspects of the AbbVie financial profile which will become evident when we begin operations in 2013.
As we build AbbVie we're keeping a close eye on what we feel is the most important for the investor.
First a sustainable top line supported by products that are leaders within their categories; second robust cash flow that will support an attractive and dependable dividend; third a continued commitment to driving efficient operations; and finally a financial policy that balances both the short and long term.
We recognize the importance of growing the dividend and we're implementing plans to deliver this while also ensuring that our new product pipeline is appropriately funded.
I'd like to now take you through how we're tracking against these objectives.
In the third quarter worldwide sales for what will be considered AbbVie increased approximately 7% on an operational basis excluding a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 4 percentage points.
Global HUMIRA sales increased nearly 16% on an operational basis and 10% on a reported basis.
HUMIRA performance in the U.S.
was driven by continued strength across therapeutic categories with particularly robust growth in the germ and gastro segments where HUMIRA continues to outpace the market's double-digit growth.
International HUMIRA growth was 7.5% on an operational basis.
This growth would have been higher when normalized for the timing of tender shipments.
Year-to-date global sales of HUMIRA are up 19.3% and international sales are up 14.5% both on an operational basis.
So as you can see we're well on track to achieve our 2012 global sale growth outlook for HUMIRA of low double-digit reported growth.
Moving on to some of our other major products AndroGel achieved U.S.
sales of nearly $280 million.
AndroGel holds the leadership position within the testosterone replacement market.
Global sales of Lupron were nearly $190 million.
Our 6-month formulation approved last year in the U.S continues to perform well driving share gains and further expanding our category leadership.
U.S.
sales of Synthroid were $132 million in the quarter.
Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and retains more than 20% market share despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago.
And finally U.S.
sales of CREON were $92 million.
CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts.
We are confident that our portfolio of products provides a strong and sustainable base for AbbVie generating significant cash flow as our late-stage pipeline continues to develop.
Turning to our outlook post separation as Tom mentioned we plan to set AbbVie's annual dividend at $1.60 per share subject to approval of the AbbVie board.
This dividend level represents a strong payout and should support a healthy initial valuation for AbbVie given current dividend yields in the 3.5% to 4% range for many of our pharma peers.
As Tom said in the coming weeks AbbVie expects to raise just under $16 billion of debt.
After a net cash distribution to Abbott of approximately $8.5 billion AbbVie will begin operations with around $7 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
This cash includes the $2.5 billion of funding raised for future operating and financing needs as noted in our recent Form 10 amendment.
I'm quite pleased with the strength of our financial position as we start operations.
Our capital structure and a strong cash flow will ensure our ability to support both our dividend and the funding of our operations going forward.
Today we're also providing our current estimates of our P&amp;L profile as we know this will be important as you begin to model AbbVie in the coming months.
We've mentioned previously that 2013 and '14 will be a time of transition for our product portfolio as our lipid franchise experiences the entry of generics.
We fully expect generic competition throughout 2013 for TriCor and for generic events to play out during the year for TRILIPIX and Niaspan and we're planning for this appropriately.
And as Tom noted our forecast for the fourth quarter assumes the launch of a generic TriCor and we recommend that you model less than $200 million in U.S.
TriCor/TRILIPIX sales in the fourth quarter.
Given the expected timing of generic TriCor late in 2012 the year-over-year sales and gross margin ratio impacts will be more acutely felt by AbbVie in 2013.
As a result we're forecasting 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise including TriCor/TRILIPIX Niaspan and SIMCOR reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion next year.
We plan to cover a significant portion of this decline through growth of key marketed products including HUMIRA.
So as we see it today we'd expect AbbVie's total sales to be somewhat above $18 billion in 2013 at current exchange rates.
As Tom mentioned AbbVie expects to report adjusted EPS on a cash basis removing noncash amortization from cost of goods sold.
For modeling purposes today we're forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 76.5% excluding noncash amortization which reflects the impact of both lipids and some unfavorable foreign exchange.
We're very pleased with our pipeline and expect to appropriately fund R&amp;D investment to drive long-term growth.
As Rick mentioned we expect R&amp;D expense of around 14% of sales.
We expect SG&amp;A to be around 26% of sales.
This includes the incremental cost of becoming an independent company as well as AbbVie's share of Abbott's corporate costs.
While some analysts and investors have estimated these incremental expenses at 1% to 2% of AbbVie sales or up to $360 million we have managed AbbVie's costs to be less than 1% of AbbVie's sales.
This reflects our initial efforts to minimize these costs and it remains our goal over time to offset as much of the remaining cost as possible through efficiency efforts.
Given our debt outstanding and average interest rates we expect net interest expense of approximately $400 million for AbbVie in 2013.
The gross interest expense that is before interest income was reflected in the pro forma adjustments in the September amendment to the Form 10.
We're also forecasting minimal other income as an existing agreement that was previously generating other income expires in 2013.
And we expect a tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013 as Tom previously discussed.
As outlined in our Form 10 we expect roughly $435 million or $0.21 per share of noncash amortization in 2013.
This is important to note as we expect AbbVie to provide its 2013 ongoing EPS guidance on a cash basis that is excluding noncash amortization for comparability purposes to most of our peers.
We will also reconcile this guidance to EPS on a GAAP basis which would include amortization expense and specified items.
As I said earlier I'm very pleased with how we're positioning AbbVie for future success including our overall capital structure the strength and durability of our cash flows the sustainability of our on-market products and the emergence of a leading late-stage pipeline.
I look forward to meeting many of you in the next few months and in the coming year.
And with that I'll turn it back over to John for some final comments.
Thanks Bill.
Before we open the call for questions let me give you a brief overview of the next steps in the separation process.
We continue to expect that Abbott and AbbVie will be independent companies on January 1 2013.
This is of course subject to the final approval of our Board of Directors declaration that the Form 10 is effective and other customary conditions.
A few weeks prior to separation we'll issue a news release describing the special dividend distribution of AbbVie stock including the distribution ratio and the record date.
We expect that when-issued trading of both company stocks to begin in mid-December with regular rate trading of both companies to begin on January 2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Abbott will continue to trade under the ticker symbol ABT and as Rick mentioned AbbVie will trade under the symbol ABBV.
In addition both Abbott and AbbVie will have separate investor roadshows beginning next month and we look forward to seeing you then.
With that Elan we'll now open the call for questions.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Miles I thought maybe we'd start with a strategic question.
As I think about the DMP strategy or the Abbott strategy going forward I feel like investors see nutrition as a big source of leverage.
They see Established Pharma and as we've seen this year as sort of a source of growth.
But they have questions on the device franchise.
So I guess how do you see the development of the device franchise? Is this a growth asset? Is it a leverage asset? And what impact do you think M&amp;A is going to play in the development of that device franchise over time? Okay.
Thanks David.
Well I'd characterize the device franchise in the following way.
I think we are in a transition period.
We've just launched a number of new products in our Vascular business for example.
We're lapping our Promus arrangement with Boston Scientific.
So we got a number of things that are sort of in transition there.
So I look for growth out of the Vascular business.
I'd say our -- and on a continuing basis because as you know we've established a very strong franchise there with our entire XIENCE franchise.
I think we've got growth potential -- tremendous growth potential really with ABSORB and with MitraClip and frankly with our Endovascular franchise.
So I expect that to be a growth business and we simply have to lap the circumstance of Promus and we've got to get our new products launched which we're under way with.
No I think we've got opportunity there a lot of opportunity including in emerging markets.
On the front of the Ophthalmology business part of that is market and economy driven and part of that is new product launches which we have a number of coming.
And then part of it is expansion into emerging markets.
So it's a similar story.
But I'd say we're in the "let's get all the ducks lined up to achieve that and be ready to do that." That business has been somewhat disappointing over the last couple of years.
But as you know the LASIK part of it and others are very dependent on economic conditions and that's really been a headwind for that business.
So I look for that business also to be a growth contributor in the future.
And then finally Diabetes Care I would characterize in 2 ways.
One it's clearly a tougher more competitive market over time.
There's been a lot of price pressure reimbursement pressure and so forth particularly from governments in Europe.
On the other hand we've got a particularly innovative pipeline and system of products coming that I think really change diabetes testing for the type 1 and type 2 tester going forward.
The first product in that lineup InsuLinx is in the market now.
And I'd say I've got a pretty exciting product line coming there.
So I look for that business to also improve from a growth standpoint going forward.
So I'm looking for growth out of all 3.
All 3 happen to be in transitional phases right now but they got a nice cadre of products coming.
At the same time we put a fair amount of emphasis on gross margin improvement in all of them and we're seeing -- we've seen a lot of margin improvement over the last few years out of Vascular.
We've seen it out of our Diabetes Care business.
I think all the prospects look good there.
But in terms of the evolution of the performance of businesses I'd say diagnostics for example is ahead of others on those tracks also with a healthy pipeline of systems that's in development.
As I mentioned there hasn't been a lot new in the diagnostics or Core Laboratory Diagnostics arena in the last many years actually several years.
And the pipeline of products under development there I think are quite exciting for us and for the market.
And I look at that across the board.
I think the evidence from our nutrition and pharmaceutical business EPD the expansion in the emerging markets the number of products that have entered those markets they are all laying the foundation for growth in what are going to be growth markets anyway.
So as I look forward my expectations are optimistic.
I'd say -- from time to time a number of analysts including yourself have challenged us on our market assumptions and I think that market has been tougher and slower to recover or slower to pick up than I had certainly hoped and any of us had hoped.
But at the same time you got to be prepared to grow through the markets.
So I put a lot of attention on our organic or internal capability in innovation R&amp;D and new products.
One of the things I'm quite pleased with as we split the company is that both companies have what I consider to be an appropriate critical mass of spending or level of spending in R&amp;D.
As you'll know over the last 10 to 12 years we've been steadily I'd say restoring or improving spending rates or investment rates in R&amp;D.
If you'll note in the AbbVie profile on the split they'll spend 14.5% in R&amp;D.
If you went back 10 12 years ago we would have struggled to spend at that level in R&amp;D.
So I'm pleased that with the performance of the company over the last 10 or 12 years and the growth we've also improved the investment and spending rates in both R&amp;D and SG&amp;A to pretty healthy levels so that the company is capable of sustaining organic innovation and sustainability going forward which has been a focus.
You asked me about M&amp;A.
I'd say M&amp;A remains from my point of view only opportunistic.
I'm putting an awful lot of our focus and emphasis right now internally.
And I think that's important particularly during the split when we'll have transition service agreements and we've got to get through the separation and let the dust settle and so forth.
I would -- I also never forecast M&amp;A transactions but I'm mindful that the foundation of the company has to be operating well and on an organic basis.
Otherwise I think we -- well I think that's what we need to pay attention to.
So I don't rule anything out.
But I'm not looking for anything big and we're not particularly active.
As you can see over the last year we haven't been.
There are a few categories or areas where we're particularly mindful whether or not there's opportunities to adjunctively add to the business or enhance the strategic strength of a business.
We're always watching for that.
We're always tracking that.
But I'd say right now I don't have anything that I could forecast on the radar screen and my focus is primarily organic.
I know it's a long answer.
It's more than you asked for.
But I thought it would cover a number of things you'd be curious about.
Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Sort of a similar question to both Bill and Rick.
Appreciate the granularity that you provided today on AbbVie going forward.
But I'm wondering if you could -- you gave us a good sense for operating margins in 2013.
But since again this business is going through so much transition with base business not changing much but facing competition in the lipid business and then new products likely to come to the market 2015 and beyond.
Can you give us a sense for where we -- where you see opportunities for operating margin leverage? The gross margin level you said was 76.5%.
Where can that go realistically driven by continued growth of HUMIRA plus new product contributions? And then how should we think about SG&amp;A and R&amp;D going forward? And then lastly just on HUMIRA Dave obviously this franchise has done extremely well.
When we think about HUMIRA 2013 and beyond just wondering what you are thinking internally about tofacitinib.
Are you assuming as I think the market is a restricted third line label.
If it's a second line label how would that affect your thoughts on HUMIRA going forward? Okay Jami this is Rick.
That was a long question.
Research Division</strong> Sorry I didn't mean to be so verbose.
Hopefully I wrote it all down right.
She's getting all her follow-up questions in now.
I think if you look at our business over the next 3 or 4 years your perspective on it is correct.
We're going to go through a transition period where we're going to have relatively flat to slightly down top line for the next couple of years driven by the loss of exclusivity primarily on our dyslipidemia franchise and then the underlying emerging growth that we continue to see out of HUMIRA offsets the majority of that.
Going forward we anticipate that HUMIRA will continue to drive growth.
Those markets are still areas where we can continue to drive penetration.
As you know the penetration rates really across all 3 segments are relatively low and we continue to see uptake of these kinds of products going forward as we expand into more and more patients and we expand geographically.
Starting in roughly 2015 you'll start to see the emergence of our pipeline going forward and you'll see top line start to accelerate particularly in the second half of '15.
From a margin standpoint we still have opportunity to be able to improve margins between now and then gross margins and we continue to work on operational improvements.
There'll be some mix improvement over time although some of that will be offset by the loss of exclusivity of some products that also have relatively high margins so there'll be a little bit of a mixed bag there.
But I think generally speaking we're focused on operational improvements in those areas.
From an SG&amp;A and an R&amp;D standpoint as I said in my comments we have a strong late-stage pipeline.
We have a number of assets that are in our mid-stage pipeline that we believe have compelling-enough data that they will likely be able to advance into Phase III.
This is an innovation-driven business.
We're certainly going to drive everything that we have that we think could be successful going forward.
So we have a commitment to be able to support R&amp;D at a level that's appropriate based on those programs that advance.
As I indicated I think for 2013 you should be assuming in the range of about 14%.
On the SG&amp;A front I'd tell you that in general both R&amp;D and SG&amp;A based on what we know about the industry we're one of the most efficient operating models.
And I think we operate very efficiently in the SG&amp;A area.
We're always careful about how we build infrastructure and make sure that we're as lean as possible but yet effective.
And so that's an area that we always focus on and it's sort of an Abbott tradition and we plan on continuing that as part of AbbVie.
On the tofa front I think our read in the U.S.
is consistent with what you described I think based on the label that we would anticipate -- on the data that we've seen publicly we would expect it to be third line.
We've anticipated both in our planning process.
Essentially I think I believe that ultimately if it comes out behind TNFs based on the profile we feel very very comfortable with how HUMIRA will perform against it.
Even if it came out with second line I think we feel very comfortable with how HUMIRA will perform against tofa.
And so we're obviously doing a lot of work in that area.
We've done a tremendous amount of market research to understand the positioning of that product and how HUMIRA stacks up against it and we feel confident with how HUMIRA will perform going forward.
I think that was everything.
Our next question is from Michael Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> First question let me just ask: You were talking a little bit about some of the kind of short-term transient headwinds facing what I'll call new Abbott post spin.
The organic growth rate by our math this quarter for new Abbott was 2.4%.
Can -- any way you could try and quantify? And if it's tough to do it right now I understand.
Could you try and quantify what the impact was Promus this quarter and the distribution change in nutritional so we can try and get a more apples-to-apples look at how new Abbott is performing? Mike this is Tom.
I -- as we did describe in our comments those were the 2 kind of transitional factors that masked the real growth rate of new Abbott.
I'd say each of those on average -- Promus is probably in the 1.5% range and the direct distribution is closer to -- approaching 1%.
So I -- if you adjust for those we did have growth more in that 4% range.
And as I mentioned in my remarks if you look at the...
You're talking about vascular in the books...
Yes new Abbott.
And as I mentioned in my remarks if you look at our year-to-date adjusted for those items we're in the mid-single-digit range.
So that gives you a feel.
Clearly we expect particularly in the nutrition area with -- when these direct distribution plans are completed that that's going to be a really nice acceleration in growth next year and will be a big part of our ability to move this growth rate up from what you're seeing this year in new Abbott.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And Tom I want to ask you about the dividend and the tax rate.
The -- what you laid out in the dividend is really consistent with what we had modeled out so there was really no surprises there in how you split it and what basically you're forecasting for '13 on the dividend.
But you indicated on the call that AbbVie's tax rate is going to go up by about 10 points from where it has been and where the Street is modeling to where it's going to be in 2013 which obviously has a big impact on people's earnings models for AbbVie and combined Abbott going forward.
I think our math on it was that it's about 8.5% negative hit to combined Abbott's EPS going forward from that increase in the AbbVie tax rate.
So is it that the -- you need to shift that much of your profits in order to support the AbbVie dividend going forward? Is that why the tax rate is going from 12% to 22%? Mike I think the key thing here is and it's really the point we've been making from the very first day we talked about this.
These are very different businesses going forward and they're operating independently.
And AbbVie -- a lot of the cash flow historically has been efficient capital that we've been able to deploy to a lot of opportunities that have really helped the overall Abbott portfolio and performance.
And going forward as separate companies AbbVie is much more focused on returns.
And it's essential that a dividend gets set at an appropriate level particularly given the focus on yields that investors have on these stocks these days.
So making that a big priority for that company it was important to rethink the balancing of the cash flows and what would be an appropriate sustainable level going forward.
Obviously we're -- we continue to be hopeful that over time Washington will continue to focus on this area.
It could provide additional opportunities for both companies if we move to a more competitive tax system.
But the rate at which AbbVie will be starting its existence is a very good sustainable rate given that the profile of the business the expectations of the investors and what the future holds as opposed to what was appropriate in the past.
Research Division</strong> So I mean -- so this is a surprise to the Street today and that's why I'm focusing on it because obviously we didn't model it this way I know people  weren't modeling it.
And that's in part because of the comments you guys had made last October on the tax rate.
So...
As Miles -- Mike as Miles indicated it's been a process since last October to provide additional information to investors as we get closer to the point at which investors are going to separately value these stocks and today is a big step in that regard.
Obviously we're going to be talking to people about the companies as we get out and talk to investors over the next couple of months.
And it's important that they have this information and understand the rationale and that it really sets AbbVie up to be very well positioned for its objectives.
Mike this is Miles.
The one thing I'd say that's clear to us as we've gone through the separation: When you split 2 businesses that do look very different from a profile standpoint and a return standpoint or frankly the expectations of investors.
One thing I've noted is some analysts and some investors are pretty good at projecting what they think each business will look like but what we don't want is for an analyst to have to guess on a lot of the parameters that help them model the business because it's so much a part of how they'll value the businesses and so forth.
So our intent both with the amendments to the Form 10 and to the additional information we put out today isn't to surprise but frankly to take out uncertainty where there's wide ranges of assumptions whether it be about interest rates or interest costs or frankly dis-synergies in transition costs or the costs of running a company separately and so forth.
And if there's different -- if there's changes like tax rate in the structure of the P&amp;L of the company we want you to know what those things are so you can model.
And there's a time when we know that there's a time when we can finally give clarity to analysts and investors about those things.
And when you put them all together it's our intent to try to take out the -- or the difficulty of modeling each company separately for you and other analysts and investors.
But other than that I think it's just new information today that frankly so many of you have been asking for to give you more ability to know what they're going to look like.
Research Division</strong> I appreciate that.
So Tom what is the payout ratio that that implies for AbbVie going forward? Roughly -- the dividend you're talking about Mike? Research Division</strong> Yes just given the higher tax rate.
Roughly 50% payout on cash earnings for the dividend.
Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> Two questions for Rick first is on the HUMIRA franchise.
If you look at the HUMIRA franchise just this quarter OUS came in a little light.
And you mentioned the timing of tenders.
But I've got to believe that European austerity is having an impact as well.
And if that's the case is this going to be a headwind for the HUMIRA OUS franchise over the next couple of years? And are there any offsets? And then as a follow-up on HUMIRA the patents in both U.S.
and Europe expire over the next 5 years is there a strategy in place that can extend the patents? And then I'd like to ask a follow-up on hepatitis after you passed -- answered the HUMIRA questions.
Okay.
So Glenn on the growth rate in the third quarter there were essentially 2 tenders that moved between quarters.
One moved out into fourth quarter one moved back into second quarter.
If you essentially adjust for those changes HUMIRA is continuing to run about mid-teens so there isn't any material impact on HUMIRA.
Having said that clearly the impact across everyone's business in Europe is being felt with some of the austerity measures that are being taken.
I wouldn't say that we feel differently than we felt for the last couple of years.
2010 from a price standpoint was probably the most difficult year the most challenging year.
If you look at this year it's in that range but slightly below that from a price erosion standpoint.
What we modeled for '13 is close to 2010 so we're planning in that range.
But it hasn't had a material impact on the performance of HUMIRA going forward and we don't expect that going forward.
As far as biosimilar competition in 2017 or 2018 which is what you're talking about obviously we spend a lot of time working on that strategy.
You have to remember that beyond just the molecule patents there are a number of process patents that will be important in the process and a number of other things that we continue to look at.
And as you know if you look at biosimilars it's a very different ballgame from small molecules.
We do not believe that it will be an interchangeable kind of or a substitutable kind of product.
And they will have to sell based on their own data if and when they come to market.
And we believe that HUMIRA's track record will stack up nicely against them.
And so it certainly will have an impact we recognize that but we think it's a manageable impact and we believe we have a number of strategies to be able to protect HUMIRA going forward...
LLC Research Division</strong> So from a modeling point of view we should assume some generics entering the market 2017 2018 correct? You should assume some biosimilar activity based on some entering the market around 2017 2018 correct.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just as a follow-up.
I had a question on your hepatitis program.
So we've seen very good very strong data from the current regimen but the current regimen also -- the protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir.
And there's a lot of questions out there whether or not this will limit the ability to take market share because of ritonavir's interaction with other drugs.
What's your best guess is as to what a ritonavir booster will do in terms of limiting the market share for your platform? And then as a follow-up the data in the nulls was really really strong and this could really establish you as a major player in that segment of the market.
How big do you think the null market would be? Let me start with ritonavir and there's obviously been a lot of questions around ritonavir.
I think it's important to recognize that the dose of ritonavir in the HCV cocktail or in the PI [ph] specifically is 1/12 the dose -- the labeled dose in ritonavir.
So we have not seen any of the side effect profile that people talk about like GI side effects lipid profile side effects in any of the clinical trials.
And we've now done a substantial number of patients as you know.
The tolerability in the trial had less than a 2% discontinuation rate and a very low rate of any kind of drug-to-drug interactions.
So we don't -- everyone can talk about ritonavir and obviously our competitors are talking about it.
The reality is the data speaks for itself and you're going to get a chance to see the data.
And a patient doesn't know or a physician doesn't really care whether it has ritonavir in it or not.
What they care about is high cure rates tolerability and ease of use of the protocol right? And I think in those fronts based on the data that we've seen thus far we're pretty confident about what we have.
And I think the data will play out over time.
We'll do our Phase III trials.
It will be an even larger cohort of patients and we'll have an opportunity to see that.
But there's nothing in this data -- and I can tell you we have been through this data very very carefully.
There is nothing in this data that concerns me from a tolerability standpoint with ritonavir.
Now I -- oh the nulls.
The null performance is very very impressive.
And as you know it's -- we haven't seen anything from any other product that even comes close to this level of performance.
The way we calculate nulls -- and we spent some time looking at this.
It would suggest to us that nulls alone are somewhere around a $2.5 billion to $3 billion opportunity so they're a pretty sizable opportunity.
And obviously the market will continue to grow as more and more therapies come out there.
So we believe that could be a very significant differentiating factor for our therapy.
We'll have to see how other data that comes out over the course of time but certainly 93% performance in null-responding patients is something that the industry has not seen before.
Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
Research Division</strong> My question first was on new Abbott.
And just not getting too much into guidance but I was just hoping you could help us think about outlook a little bit in the sense that you've talked about margins impacting -- or FX impacting the margins next year.
And obviously margin expansion is one of the attractive points for that company.
Maybe you could help us understand the way rates are currently sitting how much is that going to dilute the margin expansion next year.
Can we still expect some net margin expansion in that business? Sure.
This is Tom.
As you've seen from Abbott's performance over the years certainly within a year currency has been a little bit less impactful to us than maybe some other companies.
And it really is a function kind of the way things flow through our business.
As you know sales when currency moves that's an immediate impact whereas the impact on cost to sales kind of -- tends to lag through the inventory process.
And we've had quite a bit of that this year and some of that is going to carry into next year.
And so I'd say as we've been saying all along on the quarters with the favorability of exchange that we've been pointing out in the gross margin improvement some of that was a bit transitional this year and it's going to flip back a little bit the other way next year.
So I just think it's normalizing.
And if you look at underlying what's really going on in these businesses it's very quite positive as we've talked about in terms of improving the gross margins fundamentally.
And I think once we get through this one-time adjustment if you will of getting the margin back to a more normalized level you'll be able to see the growth of that margin as we've been talking about.
Rajeev this is Miles.
I would just add to that the following by way of background explanation.
One of the reasons that exchange doesn't translate from the top line to our bottom line as much as it may in other companies and other companies frankly do the same thing we try to put our cost base our manufacturing et cetera also in the same markets where we may experience exchange fluctuation in sales and top line because there's a natural hedge there in cost et cetera.
So for example over time to the extent that costs and manufacturing and other things are in some of the growth markets where we are growing and we are putting our plants there et cetera for the products that we will sell there there's a natural hedging there that helps mitigate the top line impact of exchange down to the bottom line.
So some years that's a plus for us on the margin line.
For this -- for example this year while the -- while the top line is experiencing negative exchange the gross margin line is experiencing positive exchange.
Important to point out though that on that gross margin line it's not all exchange.
It -- there's a big chunk of that improvement in the gross margin line that is actually actions taken to improve our cost structures or mix and whatever the case may be.
So if exchange improves on the top line next year as Tom says that'll have a dampening effect on the continued improvement of gross margin.
But we expect to continue to improve from our own actions the gross margin line.
It just won't benefit from an extra boost from exchange so it's kind of a mitigated thing both ways.
If -- at the end of the day what we're looking to do in the way we structure our own approach to exchange is to mitigate its volatility on the bottom line.
Research Division</strong> Yes no thanks for that.
I think clearly what's important is what happens on an underlying basis but it's just helpful to have expectation in the right place as far as the numbers go I thought.
I did have a follow-up on nutritionals.
I guess the growth there was a little bit lighter than what we were looking for in pediatric.
And I know you talked about some of the distributor issues but those are obviously things that you've known for several quarters.
Maybe just particularly on x U.S.
if you could talk about if any of the underlying market dynamics have changed materially this quarter and if you're thinking about the markets there any differently than you have been in the past.
Well I'd say a couple of things then I'm going to let Tom weigh in here too.
There aren't really distributor issues.
There's one circumstance fairly significant where we bought out the distributor and there's an adjustment we're going through while we let that inventory wind down and come -- and the sales wind down and come back into our own system.
It -- when -- we're -- in effect we're going direct in a lot of our markets and some of our significant ones overseas.
So there's a transition there as you do that.
It clearly is dampening.
And it's not an issue per se it's a deliberate action on our part to go more direct for a lot of favorable reasons.
Tom? I guess I'd just say that really the items we noted on the distributor changes are the kind of the drag on what one might expect.
And we do expect in the fourth quarter upper-single growth in this business.
So you're going to see a better rate we believe in the fourth quarter and we think it's even got better potential in 2013.
So I think once we get through this transition you will feel confident that those types of growth rates are possible for this business and we plan to deliver on them.
I mean you asked if there's an underlying fundamental downshift in some way not that we see no.
No we're not looking at that or expecting that.
Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
LLC Research Division</strong> Emerging market growth this quarter it was over 10% so -- and it was 12% last quarter so it seems like it's in that 10% to 12% range.
Is that a realistic rate going forward? And maybe if you can talk about AbbVie versus Abbott if there's differences there.
And then I just had one follow-up.
Well certainly in the quarter and then -- and we said this in the October meeting last year and throughout emerging markets is much more a part of the story and a much more important part of the growth opportunity on the Abbott side.
And in fact in the quarter even though overall company grew double digits it was stronger on the Abbott side and a little bit below that on the AbbVie side.
So it clearly is a more important part of the story now.
That said I think AbbVie and we've said this also does see opportunities there.
And I think somewhere in the range of $1 billion of growth in emerging markets over the 5-year period is still a part of their story.
But clearly the performance is much -- was better in the quarter on the Abbott side and really is a bigger part of the story.
The other thing I would say is some of the tenders that Rick talked about when he was talking about HUMIRA also tended to dampen down AbbVie in the third quarter and I think that is a bit transitional.
LLC Research Division</strong> And then that -- one for Miles.
At the analyst meeting last October you laid out some goals for the new Abbott to grow high single digits and EPS at a double-digit rate.
Today you're saying you can grow mid-single digits in 2013.
Could you give us a little bit of an update on kind of the long-term goals for the new Abbott and why maybe next year is mid-single digits versus your original high-single-digit goal? That's mid to upper Larry.
I just wanted to clarify.
Larry I'd say this.
There's no difference in our long-term goals at all or even our long-term expectations.
I think there's a number of things that are different now than last year but only relatively speaking.
So for example I'd say right now in 2013 I'm looking for mid- to high single digits.
And I think at that meeting last year I distinctly remember at least one of you if not a couple of you were more cautious about economy et cetera going forward and you proved to be right.
I'd say right now the difference in my outlook is more about market conditions than anything else and how slow a recovery in a number of markets around the world will come.
I think that the biggest change that I see is slower market growth rates in emerging markets.
But I'm cautious about how I describe that because when people in general look at China and this is any company that's doing business in China today not necessarily in health care and medical products people say "Gee the Chinese market's really slowed.
It was at 9% now it's at 7%." Well slow is a relative term.
7% looks pretty attractive as a matter of generality compared to developed markets and a lot of developing markets.
But I'd say that the underlying market growth rates in a number of the economies around the world are slower particularly in emerging markets than we might have originally expected and I think all industries are experiencing that right now.
And then who knows whether these things will recover as fast as everybody would like or not.
The whole world now is pretty interlocked so that if the developed markets are slow it does roll back into a number of the developing or emerging or growth markets.
So single biggest difference I think in our outlook is the underlying market growth rates or expansion rates which I think in relative terms is a more near-term thing than a long-term thing.
I think all those markets overseas that we view as growth markets are growth markets for the long term and my expectations are high-single-digit top line for the long term and mid to high in the nearer term.
Our goals haven't changed but we just -- we have to be realistic about the underlying market conditions.
Our objective is to do better than market in any circumstance so that we're growing and gaining share et cetera in our targeted geographies and targeted segments of the business.
So I'd say there's no change to my expectations.
There's a change to my assumptions about the conditions in which we operate.
That affects exchange too although we all understand exchange.
I mean I think the biggest change or surprise to my own expectations for the year was the exchange impact from growth markets.
Historically with AbbVie as part of Abbott Europe is a huge part of exchange for us.
That's less true for new Abbott going forward.
It's much more a market basket of a lot of currencies around the world which is different and a lot of those currencies have performed differently this year.
So I think a lot of this is adjustment to conditions.
And frankly I think our underlying expectations which are generally driven by our own performance the new products we bring to market the share we gain the market opportunities we access I have -- there's no change in my expectations about those.
Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
Research Division</strong> A couple of questions on Hep C.
Rick you commented with respect to the very good data the very good 12-week data in genotype 1 that you would be the first in the market in 2015 against genotype 1.
And I'm curious if that statement was correct as I wrote it down.
And second what is your -- AbbVie's expectations with respect to the competition being in the market at what time? And then the second question around Hep C is around nulls.
You did provide some commentary around the market and that's very helpful.
Although I'm curious and I seem to recall that the null data that has been presented is without cirrhotics.
Is that correct? And then I have one financial follow-up.
Okay.
As far as the nulls are concerned it is without cirrhotics that is correct.
We're going to do a cirrhotic trial now.
So it's nulls without cirrhotics.
As far as the timing you heard the comment correct.
We do anticipate that if we hit the window of early 2015 based on how we've modeled out time lines for competitive products it would suggest to us that that could be the first product to enter the market for genotype 1.
There may be products that enter the market for genotype 2 and 3 prior to that in fact I think there could be in all likelihood products that enter the market after that.
Now that's based on a set of assumptions that we're making that essentially are based on our competitive intelligence of how long we think trials would take to be able to start up.
I can tell you all of this recognized that this will be a race to get to market.
And we anticipate early in 2015 is the time frame that we should be able to hit.
And based on what we know today we're assuming that that would be first to market.
But we'll have to see how it plays out over time.
Research Division</strong> Yes sir I understand the race all too well.
The one financial question that was around AbbVie's debt-to-EBITDA.
Are you happy with that debt-to-EBITDA at least in the short term? I.e.
would you take excess cash beyond the dividend to pay that debt down? And if not does the high tax rate really imply a fair level of repatriation of capital? And that is again for AbbVie.
So Tony what we've done is we've structured AbbVie with what we think is a very strong responsible balance sheet at the onset.
As cash is generated yes -- I mean I think one of the priorities we would have is we balance our cash.
And we do look at it as an exercise in balancing between returning to shareholder funding the business but one of the other items is ultimately paying down debt as well.
And we would look to do that when we have maturities through the next couple of years.
In regards to the need to repatriate I think if you look at AbbVie we've got a pretty strong balance sheet.
We've got $7 billion of cash starting out.
The 22% tax rate will allow us to appropriately balance geographic cash flows between our needs and our uses.
And so I don't think any additional repatriation would be necessary.
Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> One part of capital allocation you haven't discussed yet for either AbbVie or Abbott is share repurchases.
Can you just outline any thoughts that you have there? Yes I mean both companies do anticipate continuing their share repurchase programs.
As you are aware Abbott's been more active this year than we have been in the last couple.
And the specific of that each company is going to have to talk about it at future dates.
We'll move on to our next question.
Our next question is from Danielle Antalffy.
Research Division</strong> Just if I could focus in for the legacy of the Abbott device business.
On the Vascular side one of -- another cardiovascular company just this morning talked about pressure cardiovascular procedure volumes in Europe.
I'm just wondering if you could talk about what you guys are seeing over in Europe and how that could be impacting stent sales going forward.
Well I think -- I don't know what the other company said this morning Danielle but we are seeing a definite pressure on PCI volumes or procedure volumes and so forth and procedure rates.
The -- what we see -- and I think it depends on what geographies you're in.
For us the pressures in Europe are somewhat offset by the growth in procedures in developing markets or growth markets other markets.
But I think for some time at least for the near term we can expect to see some continued pressure on Europe perhaps the U.S.
Research Division</strong> And then just again on the Vascular business.
Evalve I wasn't there but talked to a few docs that attended the ESC meeting and it sounds like there's more excitement being drummed up for the MitralClip.
Just wondering what your status is on that filing here in the U.S.
And should we view this business any differently after hearing some more positive data points coming out of the ESC meeting in August? Yes Danielle.
So we're -- in the U.S.
we're still hopeful for a panel probably in early part of next year in the first quarter.
That's the latest thinking okay? All right thank you.

Good morning.
This morning I will review our 2012 results and our outlook for 2013.<br><br>Abbott reported another year of strong performance in 2012 and executed on a number of key actions that will drive future growth for the company.
On January 1 we launched AbbVie as an independent Fortune 200 biopharmaceutical company.
The creation of AbbVie is a significant event in Abbott’s history and our ability to change is the reason that Abbott has endured as evidenced by the fact that in 2013 we also enter our 125th year well positioned for future success.<br><br>As we announced this morning we expect to deliver another year of strong performance.
We issued ongoing 2013 EPS guidance of $1.98 to $2.04 representing double digit growth over 2012.
I’ll talk more about the year ahead in just a moment.
As Brian mentioned our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results are for total Abbott and include the proprietary pharmaceutical business.<br><br>So for the full year 2012 Abbott delivered ongoing EPS growth that exceeded our initial guidance range.
We also generated record operating cash flow of more than $9 billion returning more than $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends.
We’ve increased our dividend payout for 40 consecutive years.
Abbott is one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency.<br><br>Since our separation announcement in October 2011 to the end of last year Abbott stock price appreciation and dividends generated a total shareholder return of nearly 30% compared to the S&amp;P 500 return of somewhat above 19%.<br><br>Before I review our business results I want to spend a few minutes on the longer term outlook for the company with the expectation that Abbott will be one of the largest and fastest growing diversified healthcare investments.
Over the last several years we recognized the significant economic and demographic shifts that are changing the healthcare industry including the development of healthcare systems and improving economic conditions in emerging economies a global population that’s growing older and living longer resulting in an increase in age related and chronic diseases and the increasing focus on the type of innovation that reduces costs for payers in addition to improving outcomes for patients and delivering value to customers.<br><br>Abbott is well positioned to become a leader in this new environment.
We’re balanced across four business segments; Branded Generics Medical Devices Diagnostics and Nutrition.
These businesses also provide us with a diverse customer base and payer mix.
We are more weighted to the growth that’s taking place in emerging economies with the expectation that 50% of our sales will occur in these faster growing economies and geographies by 2015.<br><br>We hold leadership positions across all of our major businesses.
We have many opportunities in our broad based pipeline.
This includes next-generation diagnostic systems medical devices in coronary endovascular and structural heart as well as innovations that are important to our customer facing businesses in branded generics and nutrition.
These businesses have more rapid R&amp;D cycles focused on brand enhancements local solutions and improved formulations and packaging.
And we remain focused on financial discipline and operational execution as we expand margins and continue to generate very strong cash flow upwards of $4 billion this year.<br><br>Moving on to our 2012 results and outlook for the businesses that comprise the new Abbott.
Full year 2012 new Abbott sales increased mid-single digits operationally adjusted for the transitional items we have discussed before.
The impact of Promus royalty revenues and our direct distribution initiatives in nutrition.
Emerging market sales for new Abbott which represented nearly 40% of sales continued to drive growth increasing double-digits operationally.
As we have discussed over the past year going forward Abbott will be comprised of four roughly equal sized businesses and I will provide a brief overview of each.<br><br>In our established pharmaceutical division or EPD we are generating in international sales from a large and growing portfolio of hundreds of branded generic pharmaceuticals that have broad use throughout the world.
60% of EPDs sales are in emerging markets and 40% are in developed markets.
While full year 2012 sales in developed markets were impacted by austerity measures sales in emerging markets generated strong growth.
EPD has a number of early stage geographic and product expansion initiatives underway including more than 150 registration approvals and new product launches expected in 2013.<br><br>As these initiatives generate new growth opportunities and as faster growing emerging markets become a larger percentage of EPDs sales base we expect to see steadily improving growth.
Our medical device businesses include diabetes care vision care and vascular devices.
In diabetes care in 2012 we continued the global rollout of our FreeStyle InsuLinx glucose meter.
It’s the foundation of our diabetes pipeline where we are focused on addressing the needs of insulin users.
In 2013 we are planning on several new product and software launches as well as initiating our pivotal clinical trial for our next generation sensor that we expect to first bring to the European market by the end of 2014.<br><br>In vision care we launched several new products in 2012 primarily in our cataract business which now represents nearly 65% of our vision care sales.
We have outpaced the growth of the cataract market driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets and share gains in the premium intraocular lens segment led by our TECNIS brand.
Cataract surgery remains the number one surgical procedure in the world and it’s a market that will continue to grow as the world’s population ages.<br><br>And in vascular devices we are seeing this business grow most rapidly outside the United States where we now have more than 60% of vascular sales.
We launched several important new products last year that solidified our position as the number one vascular device company globally.
And as we look to 2013 we expect to accelerate growth by first gaining share with our leading drug-eluting product portfolio.
We launched our new Xience Xpedition drug-eluting stent in Europe in August and in the U.S.
this month.
We expect to launch Expedition in Japan mid-year.<br><br>Second building on the 2012 international launch of ABSORB the world’s first and only bioresorbable vascular scaffold which is now available in more than 30 countries including most recently India.
Our pivotal clinical trial for U.S.
approval is also now underway.
Third accelerating sales of our structural heart device MitraClip in international markets.
We are planning for an FDA panel in the first half of this year as we work to bring this important product to the U.S.
market.<br><br>Four expanding our market share in endovascular where we are applying our expertise and developing best in class coronary devices to increase our penetration of this faster growing market.
And finally driving continued strong growth in emerging markets where interventional procedures are growing double-digits and penetration remains low.
This geographic segment comprises more than 20% of total vascular sales and has been growing at a strong double-digit pace.
We expect this type of growth in emerging markets to continue in 2013.<br><br>Diagnostics had another impressive year in terms of both sales and margin growth.
Full year 2012 operational sales increased more than 7% and operating margin approached 19% of sales.
We expect another year of strong performance in 2013.
Core Laboratory Diagnostics delivered 7% operational growth for the full year.
80% of this division sales occur outside the United States with more than 35% of sales in emerging geographies.
We are focused on China Brazil and Russia which combined have grown 30% year-to-date.
China is our largest growth opportunity where we have seen an increasing demand for industry-leading systems such as ARCHITECT and PRISM as this country continues to invest to improve its healthcare system.<br><br>Molecular and point of care round out our diverse portfolio of diagnostics offerings.
We’re growing both businesses as we increase penetration of systems and tests in the developed world and expand in emerging markets.<br><br>We also plan to launch several new instrument platforms across our diagnostics portfolio over the next several years.
These systems add new features that are important to our customers such as speed scalability and shorter turnaround time.
Lowering cost is also a major design objective for these programs.<br><br>While we’ll invest in diagnostics R&amp;D at a somewhat higher level in 2013 to deliver these future growth opportunities we expect continued steady expansion of diagnostics operating margin over the year ahead.
We remain on track to well exceed our original target of 20% of sales over the next few years.<br>And finally our nutrition business had a very strong fourth quarter with worldwide operational sales growth of 10% building continued momentum for 2013.
Nutrition is the fasted growing business in our portfolio and has the most opportunity for margin expansion.<br><br>In 2012 we had a number of key achievements that continue to position us well for future growth.
In the U.S we saw strong growth across our key brands maintaining our leading infant formula share with Similac and delivering double digit growth of both PediaSure and Ensure.<br><br>Outside of the U.S emerging market sales comprised more than 40% of our nutrition sales and they grew double digits for the full year for both pediatric and adult.
We’ve seen outstanding productivity from our R&amp;D organization with 80 product launches in 2012.<br><br>We made good progress on the expansion of global capacity in the U.S China and India.
Our three new manufacturing facilities are expected to come online by early next year.
And we exceeded our 2012 expectations for operating margin improvement and remain on track for our goal of exceeding 20% of sales by 2015.<br><br>So in summary New Abbott is a diversified differentiated large capital care investment opportunity well positioned to deliver top-tier growth and as we look to the future Thanks Miles.
Before I review our financial performance I’d like to explain how we’ll handle the transition from pre-separation Abbott results to post-separation Abbott results.
In our remarks today regarding 2012 our results reflect all of the pre-separation businesses including the proprietary pharmaceutical business.
Our 2013 guidance and outlook will reflect only the new Abbott businesses.
<br>Regarding 2013 comparisons to 2012 for New Abbott we plan to provide investors with a post-separation base line of the quarterly income statement on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis with appropriate reconciliations prior to our first quarter earnings release in April.
This will be for 2012.
In order to provide this information we must first complete in the coming weeks the so-called audited carve out of AbbVie results from Abbott’s combined fourth quarter results.<br><br>So while we don’t have the final 2012 baseline established as of today’s call we understand that investors are looking for perspective on 2013 growth rates on both the top and bottom line.
With that in mind today we’ll provide you with our projections of full year sales and ongoing earnings per share growth in 2013 over an estimated 2012 baseline.
Please keep in mind the growth rates against the actual 2000 baseline may change somewhat once the final 2012 carve out is completed.<br><br>Let’s move on to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results for the total company.
We’re very pleased with how we ended 2012 as we exceeded our initial expectations for ongoing earnings per share for the full year.
For the fourth quarter we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.51 in line with our previous guidance range.<br><br>Sales for the quarter increased 5.6% on an operational basis and 4.4% on a reported basis that is including an unfavorable 1.2% impact from foreign exchange.
These results are in line with the expectations we provided on our third quarter call.<br><br>We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets particularly as Miles mentioned in those businesses that will comprise New Abbott with these sales growing double digits on an operational basis in the quarter.
As we discussed in previous quarters sales growth trends for New Abbott businesses have been affected by two factors that are transitional in nature.
First the phase out of Promus royalty revenues in our vascular business.
This impacted year-over-year sales growth in 2012 and continues into the first quarter of 2013 for Japan sales.
And second the shift to direct distribution in certain markets in our international nutrition business.
Adjusting for these transitional factors new Abbott operational sales growth would have been in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter and the full year 2012.<br><br>The fourth quarter adjusted gross margins ratio for the total company was 63.3% in line with expectations including a negative exchange effect of 130 basis points.
Recall from our third quarter call that we expected the trend of favorable foreign exchange impact on the gross margin ratio that we had seen through nine-months to reserve in the fourth quarter and continue into 2013.
This is what’s occurring as we anticipated.
Excluding the impact of exchange our underlying ongoing gross margin ratio improved by around 80 basis points.<br><br>Overall as we look at 2012 we delivered a strong ongoing earnings per share growth despite a challenging environment and a foreign exchange headwind on sales of almost 3%.
We generate record full-year operating cash flow of more than $9 billion in 2012 exceeding our initial expectations and our forecast for the fourth quarter.
And we delivered these results while we successfully launched AbbVie.<br><br>Looking ahead to 2013 as of January 1 Abbott and AbbVie began operating as independent companies.
As indicated all my remarks for 2012 were for the entire pre-separation results of legacy Abbott the guidance I will now provide reflects the outlook only for new Abbott.
The AbbVie management team will discuss its outlook on a separate conference call next week.
Today we issued full year ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.98 to $2.04.
As previously discussed our non-GAAP ongoing EPS metric going forward excludes the impact of intangible amortization expense forecasted at $0.40 per share in 2013 as well as other specified items discussed in our earnings news release.<br><br>We believe this metric provides a meaningful measurement for assessing Abbott earnings power and growth.
The mid-point of our guidance range represents double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth based on an estimated 2012 ongoing EPS base line.
Sales for those businesses comprising new Abbott approached $21.5 billion in 2012.
Consistent with financial profile expectations we communicated on our third quarter call we expect 2013 full year operational sales growth that is excluding the impact of foreign exchange in the mid to high single digits.<br><br>While the impact of exchange varies across our businesses based on current exchange rates we would expect exchange to have a slightly negative impact overall on our full year reported sales.
Brian will review our growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.
From a geographic perspective we expect continued double-digit full year operational sales growth in emerging markets for 2013.
As we have discussed before approximately 70% of Abbott sales are generated outside of U.S.
and approximately 40% of sales are in emerging markets which we expect to continue increasing as a percent of Abbott’s total sales overtime.<br><br>We are forecasting a full year ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio again excluding intangible amortization expense of approximately 55% consistent with the modeling guidance provided on the third quarter call.
We are forecasting continued investments in R&amp;D to drive long-term growth in 2013 and beyond with full year ongoing R&amp;D of 6% to 7% of sales.
We forecast ongoing SG&amp;A expense somewhat above 30% of sales for the full year 2013.
We expect this ratio to decline as we progress through the quarter this year and it reflects meaningful leverage over 2012 -- the 2012 estimated base line.<br><br>I would note that SG&amp;A includes the estimated impact from the medical device tax under the U.S.
Affordable Care Act that begins in 2013.
Overall we expect to expand our full year ongoing operating margin by around 100 basis points in 2013.
We are forecasting net interest expense of around $110 million in 2013.
Non-operating income of approximately $20 million and around $50 million of expense in the exchange gain/loss line of the P&amp;L.
We are projecting the full year tax rate in 2013 at around 21% which now includes the 2013 U.S.
R&amp;D tax credit enacted into law at January 2.<br><br>As we move into the post-separation period 2013 will also be the first year we report quarterly results for New Abbott.
Certain items that span both 2013 and 2012 are expected to affect the quarterly comparisons to the 2012 baseline.
These include the impact of exchange rates on sales and margin between the years a line down of Promus revenues in Japan in the first quarter of 2013 and non-operating income recorded in 2012.
We expect these anomalies to result in less ongoing earnings per share growth in the first half of the year and more in the second.
However after adjusting for these items the underlying earnings growth for New Abbott each quarter is forecasted to be strong and more in line with our full year outlook for double digit ongoing EPS growth.<br><br>Today and as we progress through the year where significant we will communicate in advance these types of items that would affect upcoming quarterly earnings comparisons to 2012.
So specifically with regard to the first quarter of 2013 today we’re providing ongoing EPS guidance that is before specified items of $0.40 to $0.42 per share.
We forecast specified items of approximately $0.17 in the first quarter reflecting intangible amortization expense separation cost and cost reduction programs.<br><br>Our operational sales growth in the first quarter is expected to be low to mid-single digits off of 2012 baseline approaching $5.3 billion.
At current exchange rates the first quarter is our most difficult sales comparison with almost 1.5% negative impact from exchange which would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits.
We expect the last quarter of the winding down of Promus in Japan be a sales headwind of somewhat less than 1% in the first quarter.<br><br>We’re forecasting an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio again excluding intangible amortization expense that approaches 55% in the first quarter ongoing R&amp;D at around 7% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A expense of a little over 32% of sales.
Finally I’d note that we had around $40 million of non-operating income in the first quarter of 2012 related to a contractual settlement which is non-recurring in 2013.<br><br>At this time we’d also like to provide an early view of the ongoing P&amp;L profile of the system as we see it in the second quarter of 2013.
At this time we forecast operational sales growth in the second quarter in the mid to upper single digits off of 2012 baseline of around $5.3 billion.
We currently expect the second quarter gross margin to be negatively impacted by year-over-year effects of exchange.
So at this point we forecast the adjusted ongoing gross margin ratio at around 54.5% of sales in the second quarter.
We forecast ongoing R&amp;D expense at around 6.5% and ongoing SG&amp;A expense falling below 32% of sales in the second quarter of 2013.<br><br>So in summary we delivered a strong ongoing earnings per share growth in 2012 which exceeded our initial forecast while at the same time executing the steps necessary to launch AbbVie as an independent company.
Our 2013 outlook for Abbott reflects strong performance on the topline and double digit ongoing EPS growth as we continue to build Abbott to be a top-tier performer in the years ahead.<br><br>With that Thanks Tom.
This morning I’ll provide a brief overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance for each of our major businesses that comprise the New Abbott.
I’ll also review our 2013 sales outlook by business.
My comments will focus primarily on operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.<br><br>I’ll start with our established pharmaceuticals business or EPD where sales in the fourth quarter and the full year increased in the low single digits on an operational basis.
Full year 2012 sales in the emerging markets grew high single digits on an operational basis with the BRIC and key emerging markets growing mid-teens.
This growth was largely offset by mid-single digit declines in developed markets where austerity measures impacted performance.<br><br>In 2013 we expect to accelerate operational sales growth from the low single digits into the mid-single digits by executing on a number of product and geographic expansion initiatives.
We’re also moving a large number of registrations through our pipeline and regulatory approval process.
This includes increasing the breadth of our product offerings by launching new and improved formulations of our current trusted brands such as Creon and Brufen as well as launching new products such as Amitiza which we recently launched in Japan; expanding geographically including registrations of numerous productions across multiple geographies such as Central and Eastern Europe and Africa.
And accelerating and capturing new sources of growth through select licensing agreements.
Through our agreement with [Noble] in Turkey we are expanding our cardio-metabolic offering and through our agreement with Zydus we are launching new products into key Eastern European markets.<br><br>We expect to deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets in 2013 growing faster than the market in many key countries where we have strong positions.
We are particularly focused on the BRIC markets as well as several additional key emerging markets.
We expect our total emerging markets sales base to increase to approximately 65% of total EPD sales in 2013 up from 60% of EPD today.<br><br>So for the full year 2013 in EPD we expect mid-single digit operational sales growth with continued strong bottom line performance.
At current exchange rates this business would be relatively more impacted by exchange in 2013 so we would expect full year reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits.
For the first quarter of 2013 we expect low single digit operational growth with higher sales growth in the second half of 2013.
Including the impact of foreign exchange we expect a low single-digit decline in EPD sales in the first quarter.<br><br>Moving on to medical devices.
In diabetes care global sales in the fourth quarter increased more than 4% on an operational basis.
In the U.S.
in the retail segment of the market we continued to grow faster than our competition and moved into the number two market position during 2012.
Outside of the U.S.
sales growth was driven by share gains in key emerging markets and continued uptake of our FreeStyle InsuLinx meter.
Looking ahead to 2013 we expect sales to be relatively flat on an operational and reported basis.
While we expect continued growth in key emerging markets the 2013 implementation of CMS competitive bidding for Medicare patients will impact sales in the U.S.<br><br>In vision care global operational sales increased in the low single-digits for the fourth quarter and the full year.
While our LASIK business continues to be affected by economic conditions we have seen a steady acceleration in the growth of our cataract business which now represents nearly 65% of our global vision care sales.
We also saw continued strong double-digit cataract growth in emerging markets including strong performance in India and China.
For 2013 we expect low single-digit operational and reported sales growth in our vision care business driven by continued growth in cataract sales and continued emerging market expansion.<br><br>In our vascular business adjusted for the impact of non-commercial revenues including Promus full year worldwide vascular sales increased 3.5% on an operational basis.
As a reminder while the impact from the U.S.
Promus transition was completed last year the impact from the Japan Promus transition will continue into the first quarter of 2013.
Global sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 adjusted for the impact of non-commercial revenues and foreign exchange increased modestly.
International sales which comprised more than 60% of total vascular sales increased 8% operationally.
This was primarily offset by the expected decline in U.S.
XIENCE sales reflecting drug-eluting stent market dynamics as well as the difficult comparison to the fourth quarter 2011 when XIENCE PRIME was launched in the U.S.
market.<br><br>International sales represent nearly 70% of our drug-eluting coronary product portfolio which now includes both our market leading XIENCE stents as well our new bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB.
International DES sales increased nearly 13% on an operational basis in the quarter.
We expect to increase market share in 2013 with the continued global launch of our new more deliverable XIENCE Xpedition drug-eluting stent and our BVS ABSORB.
Since our launch of both new products last year in Europe we have seen meaningful share gains solidifying our deliverability advantage with Xpedition and establishing a new path forward in this market with ABSORB.<br><br>In endovascular sales increased in the low-single digits in the fourth quarter and on an operational basis including continued strong growth internationally.
In structural heart MitraClip which is our first in class treatment for mitral regurgitation continues to see strong demand outside of the United States with sales of nearly $30 million in the fourth quarter.
We have nearly doubled our 2012 sales over 2011 and plan to nearly double sales again in 2013.<br><br>Starting this month MitraClip will receive formal reimbursement coverage in Germany which is where the majority of MitraClip procedures occur today.<br><br>Looking ahead to 2013 we expect low to mid-single digit operational and reported sales growth for our vascular business driven by several new product launches as well as continued strong growth internationally particularly in emerging markets.
For the first quarter of 2013 including the impact from the wind down of the Promus transition in Japan and foreign exchange we expect reported sales to decline in the low single digits.
Adjusting for both of these items we expect first quarter sales to increase in the low single digits.<br><br>Moving on to Diagnostics.
In Core Lab Diagnostics operational sales increased nearly 6% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year.
As Miles mentioned emerging market sales represent 35% of total sales an increase in the mid-teens for both the fourth quarter and the full year.
We expect the emerging markets to represent more than 40% of Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales in the next several years.<br><br>In addition to delivering strong sales growth we are also delivering on our pipeline.
We recently launched two new tests on our architect platform that continue to broaden our menu and differentiate us from the competition.
In the coming months we’re also launching a next-generation automation solution to improve efficiencies in the lab.<br><br>In Point of Care Diagnostics worldwide sales increased more than 14% on an operational basis.
And in Molecular Diagnostics worldwide sales increased 5% on an operational basis for the fourth quarter.
For 2013 we expect our worldwide diagnostics businesses including Core Laboratory Diagnostics Point of Care and Molecular to generate mid to high single digit operational and reported sales growth with double digit growth in both Point of Care and Molecular Diagnostics.<br><br>And finally in our nutritionals business global sales increased 10% in the fourth quarter on an operational basis driven by high single digit growth in the U.S and double digit growth internationally.
In the U.S pediatric sales increased more than 8% during the quarter including strong double digit growth of both our PediaSure and Pedialyte toddler brands.<br><br>U.S adult sales also increased double digits driven by continued strong growth of Ensure where we’ve continued to launch new innovations to drive sustainable growth.
Outside of the U.S pediatric sales increased 14% on an operational basis in the quarter.
We launched several new products in the fourth quarter in key global markets including the continued rollout of our Similac Total Comfort infant formula brand as well as other specialty toddlers’ products.
Adult nutrition sales increased mid-single digits driven by continued strong growth of both Ensure and Glucerna.<br><br>We also made significant progress during the year on our margin expansion initiative in nutrition.
For the full year 2012 our operating margin improved nearly 250 basis points over 2011.
Key drivers of improvement in this division remain focus on driving down manufacturing costs reducing freight and distribution costs focusing our products and geographies on profitable growth and optimizing our supply chain.<br><br>So as we look ahead to 2013 for our global nutrition business we’re forecasting sales to approach double digit growth on an operational and reported basis.
This includes low to mid-single digit growth in our U.S business and double digit growth in our international business.<br><br>So in summary in 2012 we completed our planned separation into two leading global healthcare companies and demonstrated strength through our financial performance.
As we move into 2013 Abbott is well positioned to deliver durable top-tier growth as a diversified healthcare company one with a broad and balanced portfolio of leadership businesses that are aligned with favorable demographic and healthcare trends.<br><br>We will now open the call for questions.<br> could you just spend a minute Tom Yeah.
There’s two basic things happened beyond amortization.
There’s a little bit of post-separation.
I call it residual separation cost and there’s some previously announced actions we took in areas of cost reduction one do you have Tom a new Abbott EPS number at this point for 2012.
And the second we provided mid to upper overall operational growth as guidance for 2013 and if you were to go through all the details that Brian outlines in his remarks those details will build up to that type of growth.
So I think you will find that certainly this all hangs together.
With regard to the 2012 base line as I spent a few minutes in my remarks we need to provide investors and we plan to do so before the first quarter call with the adjusted 2012 effectively continuing operations base line for new Abbott.
As I indicated in my remarks we can't really do that until we have completed this carve out work which we still need to complete the fourth quarter which we are going to do in the coming weeks.<br><br>And once we do that we will be provide you detailed quarterly GAAP and non-GAAP reconciled P&amp;L base line if you will.
But of course we have done some modeling and as we model it and based upon this guidance range and if you take the middle of this ongoing range we have provided that would be double-digit growth plus over what we believe the 2012 base line will come in at.
So I think things are very consistent with what we have been saying and it just kind of takes us a little bit of time to come up with the precise numbers.<br><br>Among the challenges we will have when we present that is just effectively normalizing capital structure between the year.
As you know when we look at the carve out of AbbVie Miles I want to zip it on this last one.
But EPD is probably the business that people have probably the least amount of visibility into and probably the least amount of conviction in terms of sustainability of mid to high-single digit growth which you guys have talked about.
Can you just talk a little bit about the strategy to accelerate growth of those I think you are right.
I think people do lack a certain understanding or visibility to the business Mike.
And I think it comes from two major dimensions.
One is there is a lot less call it publicly available sources of data for a lot of the countries that make up this business at least for you know analysts and investors to have an independent look at.
And there is a lot of countries here as you know.
But I think the first thing is that the absence of that and the second is this is a business that’s a segment business.
Meaning there is a proprietary pharma business in a lot of countries there is a commodity generic business in a lot of countries and there is a branded generic business.
And they are all three different.
They are different.<br><br>And this branded generic business is quite large and much more like our nutrition business.
It’s very consumer facing and a lot more like that in terms of consumer choice consumer pay etcetera.
And that’s why some of the lack of complete understanding and so on.
The business however is quite attractive.
It’s very profitable it’s quite attractive.
It’s growing very nicely.
But it’s a story of really two geographies and maybe two market segments.<br><br>60% of the business now is in what we will characterize as emerging or growth markets and 40% of it is in developed markets.
And those developed markets as you know have been under a fair amount of austerity pressure.
So if I were going to [do you] an upgrade so we get a tale of two different segments here.
The BRIC countries and the other emerging markets and so forth depending on which markets are either growing very high single digits or mid-teens double-digits etcetera on the sales line.
And so the emerging markets collectively grow in double-digits very healthy.
But Europe in particular is experiencing the kind of austerity pressure on pricing and utilization that it’s experiencing for many products even outside of healthcare.
So the developed markets have been down in the last quarters mid-single digits and sort of two steps forward one step back for a while here.
So there’s a couple of things that will evolve that will drive EPD’s growth.
We believe very strongly in the growth in the various emerging markets.
That will be driven by the launch of new products of which there are many this year new registration.
So the expansion of our product lines and the launch of new or improved products that have significant potential in these markets.
So that will drive some of it.
We’re still rolling out geographic expansion.
That will drive some growth and then we’ve got good momentum in a number of these markets.
So I think certainly on the emerging side it’s all going I’d say pretty much according to what we would expect.<br><br>The European piece or developed market piece in effect we’re talking about Europe I’d say if that can stabilize and that’s getting an awful lot of attention from us from a stability standpoint that would help.
If you can stem the bleeding in Europe that would be a tremendous plus.
It is a profitable business.
It is a cash generating business but from a growth when you meld the two together when we think about the first half of the year where you gave much better visibility if we think about the acceleration from first to second quarter I think it sets up nicely for the acceleration story for the whole year.
So I wanted to come back to the first half of the year.
I think if you think about the first quarter to second quarter is it really two components? First the headwinds are fading which are largely vascular as well as the nutritional distribution and that gets you from low singles to mid.
I guess what I’m really asking is to get from mid to that upper end or upper single digit part of the guidance there’s a lot of things going and as I’d remind you from my remarks the first quarter and really you’ll be looking at dollars and the Yen.
The first quarter is the one quarter where we’re still getting a pretty tough exchange comparison of around 1.5 points on the topline.
So that’s certainly part.
You’re correct that this lapping of the Japan piece is probably the biggest anomaly.
The second after that is the direct distribution getting better as we go through the quarters throughout the year.
And just frankly a lot of the execution we are expecting across these businesses in businesses such as EPD and really the momentum we’re starting to see as nutrition exits 2012 is what’s going to continue to build throughout the year.
So I think it’s a matter of building momentum.
Vascular we shouldn’t dismiss the potential second half benefits of ABSORB and MitraClip doing better in Europe the expedition benefits we think we’re going to get in the market.
Vascular we’re expecting to see a nice pickup in momentum as we move from the first quarter on through the year.
So there are a number of elements of it.
Just to remind and I want to be sure from your question that it’s clear to investors our full year estimated growth over the baseline is mid to upper single digits growth.
So I think that level of growth across the quarters with maybe a little bit better in the back and as we said Tom.
And then Miles maybe more of a strategic question.
You’ve been very clear about the growth objectives and the growth potential of New Abbott.
If you think about capital allocation what should investors be prepared for over the next couple of years? You have a dividend an extremely clean balance sheet that’s likely to get cleaner by the end of the year.
So in the first two years of the development of the New Abbott growth story is this more dividend share repurchased or is this more dividend with selective M&amp;A? What should investors be prepared for over the next couple of years as it relates to capital deployment? I think we've been clear that there is a certain level of dividend and share repurchase that investors have come to expect from us on a relatively reliable steady even growing basis.
We've not been one to do big spikes of share repurchase et cetera to – we believe more in a steady return to shareholders over time.
And I think it’s important that we live to that steady and reliable return to shareholder identity.
I got some feedback from investors in the fall both positive -- more positive I guess about dividend.
People like the reliability of income but they always want more income.
And the payout ratios between the two companies now in the split are different.
They are combined greater than what Abbott paid up through the end of last year on a percent of EPS basis.<br><br>But AbbVie pays proportionality higher as a percentage of EPS we now pay proportionally lower as a percentage of EPS.
But both are growing dividends.
And I got feedback from some thoughtful investors about that and I always listen to investors but I would say at this point we have communicated at least and opening philosophy of the dividend payout.
But frankly could that change with time it could.
But I would tell you that the change is it’s likely to increase not do anything else.<br><br>So because we actually believe in a cash return to our investors in a dividend like fashion.
Now buried in your question there was that secret little what about M&amp;A thing.
And we have had a track record in the past of occasionally adding pieces to our business when it made the most economic sense for us etcetera.
And while that hasn’t been an area of high focus in the last one to two years that’s been largely because I don’t think there has been as much that was attractive to us and we were consumed with the work required to split the companies.<br><br>As I communicated with a lot of our investors in the fall we are always kind of paying attention and tracking what might make sense.
But my criteria are always the same it strategically has to fit.
What we are doing where we are headed what we are trying to accomplish and so forth.
And it’s got to make economic sense.
Got to make economic sense deal sense for us it’s got to make economic and deal sense for our investors.
And I would say our track record is such we have been pretty thoughtful and pretty careful about that been fairly selective etcetera.<br><br>I don’t rule it out but I would tell you that the projections that we have right now for the business going forward for 2013 and beyond don’t require it.
We don’t have some gap in there where we are projecting returns or projecting growth that we don’t know that we can deliver with what we already have.
So I look at the M&amp;A opportunities or licensing opportunities as opportunistic.
And if you ask me are there some of those are on our radar screen I would say yes and I had communicated that you know the categories that have attraction for us tend to be in device areas or some geographic expansion perhaps in some selective categories of pharma etcetera that we have communicated.
But they are fairly defined.
I mean they are real broad.<br><br>And beyond that I almost never project what we are going to be interested in or what we are watching or what we are doing for all the competitive reasons that you can imagine.
The press seems to do a pretty good job of speculating on just about everything that comes to market that Abbott might be interested in.
More often than not we aren’t.
We have got  in our own minds what we know will fit well with our business suppose it makes for great media to speculate from time to time.
But in any case we like to keep some of our powder dry so that we are prepared if a good opportunity comes along.
So we like to keep some liquidity in our hands and we don’t like to let too much liquidity sit in our hands and earn little.
So we keep a balance of dividend in there.<br><br>And frankly if we accumulate a lot of cash and we just don’t seem to finding opportunities for it there was a nice acceleration versus a slowing in Q3.
And I guess more specifically I would point out nutritionals molecular diagnostics diabetes I'll take a little crack at framing this and then I'll let Tom and Brian chime in here.
I'd say first of all while we like nice sequential smooth quarters the world doesn't actually provide us that.
The world doesn't act in smooth fashion.
And our third quarter tends to always be I guess I'd say the slowest of the four of the year because of obvious seasonal impacts and so forth.
Whether it's exchange or any of the temporal events that Tom talked about earlier during the course of the year that obviously has some impact too.
Over the course of the year there were a number of programs or projects that we undertook that you'd begin to see the fruition come to you in the latter part of the year to jumpstart 2013.
So I'd say a lot of that is at play here and some of it's just plain old economy in some places or the launch of products taking hold.<br><br>As we look at 2013 Tom indicated we're still lapping some of the one-time events of the early part of the year particularly exchange and so even '13 won't look particularly beautiful in terms of smoothness.
It will look like the tale of two halves; a slower first half and a much more robust second half and that's not really a hockey stick in there as much as it’s comparisons.
The underlying true growth of the business is nice and solid and the launch and timing of products and so forth solid.
So one of our challenges for the year is giving you good visibility to that quarterly gating and what underlying momentum is.
Mike called out earlier there's a need I think too for analysts and investors to know what the baseline is they're comparing to.<br><br>And so we've got to be able to give you here I'd say by the end of the first quarter or in the first quarter call what the quarterly breakdown is of Abbott separated from AbbVie which this carve-out completion will give us and then we'll be able to more precisely show you here's the underlying momentum here's those one-time or bigger offsets like exchange that swing so much.
And then I think underneath that you'll see – we've got to breakdown as I said when I was answering Mike's question about the branded generics business you’ve got to look at the components.
You’ve got to look at the emerging market piece you’ve got to look at the European piece and we can show you that separately so that you can see what parts of the business are truly driving growth and where we've got our challenges with austerity measures and so forth.<br><br>So I think all of that plays in.
We've got to sort it out for you because as we know going forward this is not a business where we're tracking HUMIRA and everything else.
We've got to give you some insight into all the individual pieces.
I would say the underlying growth of the businesses as we say is significant and promising and we think it’s mid-to-high-single and there's some events that happened over the course of the year including product launches and so forth that drive us toward that higher single that we want to see.
Brian Tom Yeah.
David I think Brian will just cover a couple of the business as you talked about where the momentum did pick up in the quarter and give you a little more color on that.
Why don't you go ahead Hi David.
Let me start with Nutritionals.
As you saw in the quarter we performed at double-digits.
We were up double-digits year-over-year and we had strong performance both in the U.S.
as well as our international business.
We've been seeing strong performance out of the U.S.
all year.
In this quarter we saw particularly continued strong performance from our up-age toddler brands and we have PediaSure and Pedialyte there that have been performing double-digits; PediaSure most notably consistently throughout the year.
We also maintained as you know the share leadership there in the U.S.
market as far as our infant formula market where we have a commanding share lead.
As we move into 2013 this may moderate a little bit but we're up against the market in infant formula.
That’s relatively flat.
However we have a lot of momentum from our PediaSure and Pedialyte that will continue into next year that will help offset that.<br><br>Also we have on our adult business has been growing very strong.
It's been growing double digits in the Ensure business for the U.S.
and a lot of this comes from new product launches.
We've launched a lot of products across our Ensure line most notably Ensure Complete and we're seeing that these innovations matter.
And as Miles mentioned we had 80 product launches this year across nutrition.
So that's been a real differentiator for our portfolio.
If you switch over to international and you take out what we have been talking about these headwinds on the distribution as we change how we distribute to our end customer we have been growing double-digits in our Nutrition business.
This quarter we didn't have any headwinds from the distribution programs that we are working through and what you're seeing is now the results coming through on a peer basis.
We have very nice momentum in China where sequentially we're gaining share and we continue to plan to do so as well into next year.
And then if you take a lot of the key emerging markets in nutrition Miles you could help me think.
Just on a longer-term basis where you think conceptually about the growth rate of the business and the top line that it’s sort of a combination of emerging markets growth  driven by strengthening of those economies lab build out I think about the long-term growth rate in a couple of ways.
First of all you are right the emerging markets have their own tailwinds.
You know their own wave if you will.
And in those markets I want a bigger surfboard to ride that wave and I think that’s a question of expanding product lines.
Whether it’s registrations in the pharmaceutical business or more product innovations in the nutrition business or taking our device businesses more thoroughly into those markets which we are doing.<br><br>We are seeing great opportunity for all of them as those economies and those healthcare systems develop and the sophistication of medicine practice there expand.
We are seeing the impact of that on diagnostics we are seeing it in our coronary business we are seeing it in our medical optics business.
They are all benefiting from that.
And the Abbott presence there and the Abbott brand there is actually a big boost to that.
I would tell you that -- I recall a consultant telling me about five years ago that there was no point in diagnostics being in China.
Five years later I am glad we ignored that.
You know it’s a fantastic market for us.
We fit well there.
It’s great growth and great profitability on top of it so we are in a nice position there.<br><br>So those markets that have their own tailwind of expansion and growth are great.
And it still behooves us to expand and tailor our product lines and so forth to those markets which we are doing.
Developed markets are still of very high importance and interest to us.
And I think that to be forthright about it it’s a little different story.
You are not relying on the tailwind of growth you have to take share and you have to do it by demonstrating to the payor and/or the customer that your value or your cost position relative to what you deliver is valuable and worth it.<br><br>And hence our offerings in diagnostics we will pay a lot of attention to that going forward.
I think we have got great opportunity in diagnostics in these markets in core diagnostics that I think our business today is demonstrating already with its high single-digit growth rate mid to high single digit growth rate in Europe and other developed countries and economies.
So what we know is in our next generation products and systems they need to be even more cost effective for us to have a good value proposition in those markets on a sustainable basis.<br><br>So I think the developed markets are still awfully attractive to us.
I think the nutrition business has shown that even in markets where birth rates are declining we are taking share.
The U.S.
stent is just a prime example.
And we can grow and expand and create an adult nutrition market because we can show that it’s got merit and value and in a lot of cases we are putting the clinical evidence behind our products to show that.<br><br>So there are opportunities.
Our EPD business as you know will struggle for a while in developed markets.
And we are looking at all the ways that we might staunch that.
But I think -- and in our devices I would say as has been pointed out many times by those people who followed the device markets particularly the coronary device markets or vascular device markets.
This is no longer a market where you just bring a new innovation out or a new technology price it higher and the market expands to absorb the cost.<br><br>Today whether it's countries in Europe or hospitals in the United States or anywhere they've got a fixed budget.
They've only got so much to spend and they are trying to make that fixed amount of money cover as much innovation as they can.
And I think that means that companies like us change our strategy.
We've got probably the most thorough and powerful product line top-to-bottom in the stent category.
And our job is to take share out of a fixed revenue pool fixed profit pool out there and I'd say that probably forecasts a change to our strategy.
And we think we've got the wherewithal to alter that strategy and take share and grow in our business and actually achieve the returns for the innovation we've invested in.<br><br>So I think those developed markets are ones where competition is such you got to take share and in the emerging markets you're going to ride a wave of tail-winded growth.
And from our perspective we think that the leadership positions we have in each of our businesses the product lines we offer and the things that we have on the board for our pipeline are all well-defined and well-designed for exactly that and that we'll see lower growth rates out of developed markets I can tell you that Rick Gonzalez won't want me answering any of his questions.
I'm going to leave it for him next week to ask him about HUMIRA we've just – even though the infant side of this market is a little tougher because of birthrates and the like we've just had outstanding brand execution on the PediaSure and the Ensure and a number of our brands really across the portfolio and it does come down to innovation.
When we can bring out a differentiated product that delivers value for customers we're finding we can take share in the various markets and I think the team did a truly outstanding job at that in 2012.
For 2013 we have a little bit lower growth expectation in that business and to the contrary a little bit higher growth expectation on the international side.
So overall higher growth for the nutrition business overall and really it's just continued brand execution and more or less offsetting a flattish instant market that we've been experiencing.
That's an area where clearly we'd like to continue to take share and gain some growth and the team is focused on that.
So I think in the U.S.
more of a mid to upper sustainable growth rate is probably more in the range this team is really moving into its full execution mode after coming together from the disparate businesses a lot of focus on commercial execution in this market.
And then there has been some cost management as well in this side.
So we're trying to be sure that the costs are in line with the revenue opportunities and I'd say those are the two key things.
We're open to product opportunities coming out of the various product pipelines including areas like the collaborations we've had et cetera.
To the extent we can bring those to the market that should offset some of the austerity measures.
The last thing I'd say is while the last 12 to 18 months have been tough from an austerity perspective as we exit 2012 and as we go into 2013 I think we are seeing a bit of stabilization there and I think the comps in the second half of the year relative to the austerity measures should be better and hopefully the government won't be quite as aggressive as we go forward as they have been as they've gone through this very depending on the country but sometimes the price pressure is greater on the generic or branded generic products than the innovative products.
And it depends on the country because they do protect innovation and they do protect the patented products.
But once of course it’s off patent then it's a different story.
But I think we have felt a fair amount of pressure there and to some degree the impact on the business is a lot less than probably what it could have been.
And I think that the innovations that we put into our products improvements in our products expansion of the registrations and products on the shelf or adding new products all of that helps.
And it's sort of a -- it's hard to be specific within detail because it kind of depends locally on each market each country and the mix of product in that country one for Tom.
I wonder if you can help us with the quarterly earnings split for the year.
You've given us guidance for 1Q $0.40 to $0.42.
Should we assume 2Q is in that range and then 4Q we get a big hockey stick with EPS north of $0.60? And then any commentary on share count I'll say just a few things.
First of all when you look at the baseline of the new Abbott businesses the patterning we're seeing in 2012 there are couple of anomalies as I talked about in my remarks.
But overall in general and it's been in this way in this company for number of years with or without the pharmaceutical business that the second half is generally a more profitable year growth is driven harder generally stronger and margins are a little bit better as we are leveraging that expense base.
So I don't think the patterning you are going to see here is that much different than what you really have seen at Abbott over the years and it's just a function of the business and as Miles mentioned for example some of the seasonality factors.<br><br>So I think that's one piece of it.
And then when you're talking about the second quarter I think the best thing to do is just to take the profile information I've provided in my remarks and that should give you a good sense of at least this point where we see the quarter coming out and obviously when we get into the first quarter call we'll provide a more specific guidance range.
But the intention of trying to give you an early look at the second quarter was to help you kind of build that quarterly gating before we get this final baseline out in front of you.
So I think it's -- and as I said in my remarks You're not going to have to wait for the fourth year to see it Glenn fourth quarter we had a pretty active year in 2012 and we are definitely planning a level of share repurchase for 2013.
Obviously with the separate company our relative amounts perspective changes and specifically on China.
That's one area of concern that I hear with investors and that is China in the nutritional market is slowing.
And I think the investors hear that because that's commentary coming from Mead Johnson.
So Miles can you talk about the size of your China nutritionals business and how you see that market? I'm assuming your growth is accelerating but clearly China is an important one for us number one.
Number two investors have asked me all during the late fall gee are we seeing a slowing in China? The answer is no we're not.
We're actually seeing acceleration and expansion and we're expanding and our growth rate in China is pretty healthy.
And I think China I would tell you is a very difficult market for investors analysts and even the manufacturers to measure from time-to-time.
I did see that one of our competitors in the industry there acknowledged inventory challenges in China.
It's hard to measure inventory in China and it's hard to keep track of inventory in China.
We know that.
I think the large multinationals that are extremely well established have a better view of that than many.
It's one of the reasons to be out of distributors and go direct.
You can have a greater control over inventories and so forth.
I’ve seen that some competitors have indicated that they may have inventory challenges in the market and it's a hard – if you got too much inventory in the market you might think the market is slowing.
I would tell you the underlying fundamentals of that market don't appear to us to be changing of slowing.
So I think that any of us from time-to-time go through little ups and downs of the absorption of our products in that market.
It's such a healthy market such a good market that I think measuring it quarter-to-quarter isn't always that informative.
You’ve got to look at it over the course of the year and I think our competitors will probably acknowledge the same that it's a very healthy market still robust and we're all still expanding into more cities.
It's intensely competitive.
It’s obviously drawn a lot of competitive attention of the large four multinationals which includes us Mead the Europeans do very well in that market and there's some local Chinese manufacturers in the value segments that are also growing and doing well.
I don't have much to say about the market except that it's really robust good and we're not experiencing a slowdown there Glenn.
We have time for one more question.
Good morning.
Thanks for fitting me in.
Tom let me start with a financial question.
The midpoint of the old guidance that you gave was about $2.03.
The tax rate came down a little bit gives you about $0.02.
So that gets you about to $2.05 and the midpoint for today's guidance is $2.01.
So am I doing the math right? What changed? And the baseline operating margin -- so I think the midpoint of the operating margin guidance for 2013 in the last call was about 18.5%.
What is your best guess as that what that was for the new Abbott in 2012? And then I just have one follow-up.
I'd just like to clarify something.
Obviously this was the first time we’ve provide guidance.
On the third quarter call as we moved into our discussions on the two new companies we felt it was appropriate to provide some meaningful profile perspectives on both companies which we did on that call and certainly -- and I think the key message there was from a New Abbott perspective was that given the topline growth and our ability to grow the bottom line and expand margins that we saw this as a double digit grower.
So this was the first time we provided guidance.
Now if you look at that profile information a lot has changed in the world since October but not a lot has changed in terms of our forecast.
We're still very close to that profile that we provided.
Tax is a little bit better because of the R&amp;D tax credit which obviously we didn't know about back in October and we've gone through a budgeting process.
We've looked at final exchange rates which in a number of countries have moved significantly since October and it’s just a function of completing our budget process which is why we didn't provide guidance in October because we knew we needed to go through that process before we could provide you a meaningful guidance number.
So I think what we're providing today is very very consistent with what we've talked about in October and anything that – $0.01 or $0.02 up or down is really a function of just the process we've been going through.
So I think that hopefully answers your question there Larry.
Tom and the R&amp;D tax credit for 2012 did you pushed that into 2013? And then I just wanted to ask on the Established Pharma the potential impact to the new drug pricing list in India can you talk a little bit about that? We've gotten some questions on it.
I think you guys have roughly $800 million to $1 billion of exposure in India and I'll drop.
Thank you.
Yeah.
So the 2012 R&amp;D tax credit which as most investors know who have been following the story very odd for all companies the way this has to be handled.
Since Congress didn't approve the law until after the 31st of December the accounting impact of getting the 2012 credit actually becomes a 2013 accounting event.
That is not reflected in our ongoing guidance.
We're planning to call that out as a specified good news item if you will in our quarterly reporting in 2013 and that is not reflected.
What is included in the guidance is the regular 2013 R&amp;D credit which is now law which we can count on as we move through the year.
With regard to your question on India obviously there has been a fair amount of discussion with various ministries on the pricing environment in India.
As one might expect this has gone through a quite a range of discussion.
The most recent feedback on this was more of a market-based model which is much more consistent with the way we view the appropriate approach towards balancing innovation and customer needs within the market.
And if you look at the result of that conclusion it's very consistent with our planning assumptions for 2013 for the established pharmaceutical division.
So at this point in time we feel good about our assumptions.
I know there are additional discussions going on and there is not a final approach towards this but all information we have at this point is that our assumptions are solid for 2013.
Okay.
Thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions.

Okay thanks Brian.
Good morning.
This morning we reported first quarter results that were in line with our expectations.
Ongoing earnings per share were $0.42 which is at the high end of our guidance range and sales increased 3.5% operationally led by a strong performance in our nutrition and diagnostics businesses.
We are confirming our full year 2013 ongoing earnings per share outlook which is for double-digit growth at the mid-point of the range.
We are delivering on our current growth expectations despite a mixed global economy developed markets globally continue to be challenged by 2012 austerity measures and weak economic conditions and that impacted our results this quarter as we saw sales decline low single digits before exchange in these markets.
We planned for that and expect to see some improvement in the second half of the year.
And while most developed market currencies were relatively stable the Yen weakened significantly representative of the efforts by some governments to stimulate weak economies.
At the same time emerging markets continue to be a significant opportunity for us one where the demand for healthcare and nutrition is going rapidly and where Abbott is well positioned to benefit from the favorable trends that are taking place in these markets.
This quarter more than 40% of our total sales were in emerging markets in the first quarter we saw particularly strong growth in China India Russia and Vietnam with sales in 8 key emerging markets up 18% before exchange.
As we accelerate growth across these countries we expect to expand our emerging market sales more than 50% of Abbott's total sales over the next several years.
Before Tom and Brian discuss our results in detail I will briefly comment on our strategic priority as they relate to first quarter performance.
As I just discussed driving above market growth across emerging markets is a key priority.
Our sales across all of the emerging markets were $2.2 billion in the first quarter increasing 15% with strong results across our major businesses including nutrition core diagnostics and vascular devices.
In nutrition emerging market sales represent 45% of total nutrition sales and increased more than 20%.
We have broad global reach today with our pediatric and adult brands and we prioritize the group of key markets to deliver on our future growth targets.
This includes multiple countries where we are expanding our current leadership positions such as the Vietnam where we are shaping new markets such as India and where we are aggressively expanding our geographic reach such as China.
By 2015 we expect to more than double our presence in China which is the largest and fastest growing nutritional market in the world.
We are executing well against that goal through the first quarter of this year.
We are also making progress with the expansion of global capacity to support the continued strong global demand for pediatric and adult nutrition.
Our three new facilities in China India and the U.S.
are expected to come online later this year or early next year.
In established pharmaceuticals we have prioritized 14 emerging markets where the demand for healthcare is rapidly expanding and where we are building our presence to drive above market growth.
Sales at these key emerging markets represent approximately 50% of EPD's sales and this quarter increased nearly 9% led by growth in Russia India and China.
We anticipate our key emerging markets to deliver double-digit growth for the full year as we continue to build out our local product portfolios and expand in-country in these markets.
In medical devices vascular devices delivered 20% emerging market growth while medical optics and diabetes care delivered mid-teens growth.
Medical devices growth was driven by continued strong performance of our TECNIS brand of cataract intraocular lenses and our market leading vascular leading technology.
In our diabetes care business our emerging markets strength was driven by share gains in several key market including China.
In diagnostics more than 70% of our sales occur outside the United States with a growing portion in emerging markets.
In core laboratory diagnostics these markets represent nearly 40% of sales and we continue to outpace market growth in our priority markets again China Brazil and Russia.
We have seen continued strong demand in the core laboratory for our industry-leading systems including ARCHITECT.
In China this business again grew nearly 40%.
Our second priority is to continue to drive share gains and market expansion through new product launches and brand enhancements.
In nutrition this quarter we completed 19 new product launches globally on track for approximately 70 by year-end.
This includes the first international market launches of our new Similac next generation formula and a continued global roll-out of our infant formula tolerance line.
These innovations contributed to our 21% growth rate in international pediatric nutrition.
In the U.S.
we have launched a new line of ZonePerfect bars as well as innovations across our Similac brand to maintain our leading infant formula share position in the hospital and retail segments.
In established pharmaceuticals we completed more than 45 new product launches across 16 geographies.
This included new formulations in core brands that broaden our key therapeutic portfolios in gastroenterology and neurology.
In medical devices we continued the roll out of absorb in international markets and in January initiated our absorb U.S.
pivotal trial.
Also in January in the U.S.
we launched our new drug-eluting stent system XIENCE Xpedition and are on track for a mid-year approval in Japan.
MitraClip our structural heart device for mitral regurgitation increased double-digits internationally.
In medical optics we launched the new cataract intraocular lens in Japan which now give us access to 70% of the market where we were not previously competing.
We also expect to launch our TECNIS Toric IOL in the U.S.
shortly.
In diabetes care we are on track to initiate our pivotal trial by year-end for our next generation sensor that we expect to first bring to the European market by the end of 2014.
And in diagnostics we continue to broaden our ARCHITECT menu with several new tests.
We also launched our next generation automation solution that improves efficiency and work flow and increased testing volumes.
Development work continued on six new system platforms across core laboratory point of care and molecular that are expected to launch over the next several years.
These new systems add new features that are important to our customers such as speed scalability and shorter turnaround time.
The third priority I’ll highlight is margin expansion.
Our operating margin in the first quarter was in line with our expectation and we remain on track to deliver approximately 100 basis points of expansion for the full year.
While we’re focused on margin improvement across our businesses nutrition and diagnostics are driving much of the improvement this year.
Nutrition operating margin increased significantly over the first quarter 2012 on track to improve at least 300 basis points for the full year.
We’re confident in our ability to deliver on our target of 20% of sales by 2015 as we implemented a number of planned actions last year and expect to continue our progress in 2013.
In diagnostics operating margin also improved over the prior year as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives in manufacturing supply chain.
We’re on track to reach our 2015 operating margin target in this business as well which is to exceed 20% of sales.
So in summary our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and as we continue to execute on our key business priorities we expect to deliver on our double digit ongoing EPS growth target for the full year.
I’ll now turn the call over to Tom to review our first quarter results and the 2013 outlook in more detail.
Tom? Thanks Miles.
Before we review our financial performance I’d like to mention that yesterday we furnished an 8-K detailing the 2012 quarterly income statement for New Abbott on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis with appropriate reconciliations.
With that in mind our review of results for the first quarter of 2013 and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2013 will reflect comparisons with 2012 ongoing baseline in the 8-K.
So for the first quarter of 2013 we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $0.42 at the upper end of our previous guidance range.
Sales for the quarter were in line with previous guidance with operational growth of 3.5% and 1.8% growth on a reported basis which includes an unfavorable impact of 1.7% from foreign exchange.
Sales growth was driven by strong performance across a number of products and businesses most notably nutrition and diagnostics along with strong growth across all of our business in emerging markets which grew 15% on an operational basis in the quarter.
First quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.8% somewhat above our forecast due in part to the timing of exchange effect on this ratio.
In the quarter ongoing R&amp;D investments was around 6.5% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A expense was around 32.5% of sales both in line with expectations.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2013 today we’re confirming our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.98 to $2.04 which reflects double digit growth over 2012 at the midpoint of the range.
Regarding sales for the full year 2013 we continue to forecast operational growth that is excluding the impact of foreign exchange in the mid to high single digits with a somewhat higher forecast for nutrition offset by somewhat lower expectations for vascular.
Based on current exchange rates we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1% on our full year reported sales.
Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 55% consistent with guidance previously provided.
We also continue to forecast ongoing R&amp;D of 6% to 7% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A expense somewhat above 30% of sales for the full year of 2013.
Overall we continue to project expansion of our full year adjusted operating margin by around 100 basis points in 2013 consistent with previous guidance.
We continue to forecast net interest expense of around $110 million in 2013 non-operating income of approximately $20 million and around $50 million of expense in the exchange gain loss line of P&amp;L.
Finally we continue to expect an ongoing tax rate of around 21% for the full year 2013 consistent with guidance previously provided.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter of 2013.
We’re forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.45.
Our operational sales growth in the second quarter is expected to be in the mid-single digits.
At current exchange rates we would expect roughly 1% negative impact from exchange and sales in the second quarter.
So that at these exchange rates we forecast reported sales growth approaching mid-single digits.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio at around 54.5% of sales in the second quarter which includes a negative impact from exchange of nearly 1%.
We also forecast ongoing R&amp;D at around 6.5% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A expense of somewhat under 32% of sales for the second quarter.
So in summary we are off to a good start in 2013 delivering at the upper end of our ongoing EPS expectations and confirming our 2013 ongoing earnings per share guidance.
This outlook again reflects strong performance as we continue to build Abbott to deliver reliable top tier performance in the years ahead.
With that let's turn to Brian for the operating highlights by business.
Thanks Tom.
This morning I will provide an overview of the first quarter 2013 performance for each of our business and we will also review our second quarter 2013 sales outlook by business.
My comments will focus primarily on operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
Let's start with our nutrition business where global sales increased 9% in the first quarter on an operational basis driven by 15% growth internationally.
International pediatric sales grew 21% operationally driven by uptake of new innovations in Similac formula continued strong double-digit growth of PediaSure and above market growth in the emerging markets as we continue our geographic expansion.
Adult nutrition sales increased 6% led by continued strong growth of Ensure and Glucerna.
As the global leader in adult nutrition we continue to shape this market as the world's population ages.
In the U.S.
first quarter nutrition sales increased 2.1% in line with our expectations.
U.S.
pediatric sales were driven by continued strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand partially offset by a slight decline of infant formula sales.
While we continue to have a leading share position in the U.S.
we experienced some unfavorable year-over-year impact due to lower (inaudible) volume.
First quarter U.S.
adult sales were driven by share and category growth of our market leading Ensure brand somewhat offset by lower than expected retail category growth.
As we look ahead to the second quarter we expect our global nutrition business to growth high single digits on an operational basis.
Again led by strong international sales growth as we continue with our portfolio of innovations and geographic expansion to drive share gains in emerging markets.
Moving on to diagnostics.
In core laboratory diagnostics operational sales increased nearly 6% in the first quarter.
About 80% of our core laboratory diagnostics sales are generated outside the U.S.
where we saw nearly 9% operational growth in the quarter.
As Miles mentioned we also saw a strong emerging market sales growth led by China and Russia which grew 40% and 35% respectively.
We delivered on several new product approvals in the quarter expanding our ARCHITECT platform menu by launching six new tests and launching our next generation automation solution designed to help laboratories improve efficiencies and workflow.
We will continue to broaden our menu throughout this year and continue to invest in the development of our next generation platforms.
In molecular diagnostics worldwide sales increased nearly 2% on an operational basis in the first quarter in line with our expectations.
Led by strong growth in emerging markets partially offset by market conditions in Europe.
In point of care diagnostics worldwide sales increased more than 17% on an operational basis as we continue to expand our leadership positions in the United States.
For the second quarter we are forecasting our global diagnostics business segment to generate mid to high single-digit operational sales growth with continued strong growth from core lab and point of care diagnostics and accelerated growth in molecular diagnostics.
I will now review our established pharmaceuticals business or EPD.
Sales in the quarter increased just over 1% on an operational basis consistent with our previous guidance.
In EPD we are focused on 14 key emerging markets which include India Russia China Brazil and ten additional key markets.
These markets comprise nearly 50% of EPDs sales and grew approximately 9% in the quarter.
As previously discussed we expect the emerging markets to comprise an even larger portion of EPDs sales over time.
As expected growth in other markets which includes developed markets such as Western Europe and Japan and other emerging markets was negatively impacted by European austerity measures and the Japan NHI pricing actions taken in 2012.
We expect to accelerate operational sales growth in EPD over the course of the year as the impact of austerity and pricing actions subside and as we execute on a number of product and geographic expansion initiatives.
With respect to the second quarter we expect low single digit operational sales growth from our established pharmaceuticals business.
And finally Medical Devices which includes our vascular diabetes care and vision care businesses.
In our vascular business worldwide sales decreased 6% on an operational basis including the expected non-commercial revenue decline related to the Promus agreement as well as the negative impact of Japan 2012 NHI pricing actions.
Excluding Promus sales declined 2.5% on an operational basis.
International sales which comprise more than 60% of total vascular sales increased 4% operationally.
Sales in the emerging markets represent 25% of vascular sales and grew 20% in the quarter.
Recent international launches of our XIENCE Xpedition drug eluting stent and bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB coupled with contributions from MitraClip and strong growth in the emerging markets are the key drivers of our international performance.
Last month at the American College of Cardiology meeting we announced positive long-term results from the ABSORB trial indicating that our bioresorbable vascular scaffold provided unique benefits not possible with metallic stents.
These benefits include increases in vessel over time reduction in plaque and improved vessel function.
U.S vascular sales in the quarter declined 19% driven by the expected decline of certain royalty revenues and soft market conditions including price.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2013 we expect our global vascular business to be relatively flat on an operational basis.
We expect to improve our performance over the course of this year with the continued uptake of XIENCE Xpedition in the U.S the expected launch of XIENCE Xpedition in Japan continued emerging markets execution and continued penetration of our new products MitraClip and ABSORB.
In diabetes care global sales in the first quarter were relatively flat on an operational basis in line with our expectations.
Outside the U.S growth of 3% was driven by share gains in key emerging markets which grew double digits in the quarter as well as the continuing uptake of our freestyle InsuLinx meter.
In the U.S we saw continued share gains in the hospital and retail segments offset by marketing pricing pressures and lower Medicare mail order purchases.
Moving to the second quarter in our diabetes care business we project sales to be relatively flat on an operational basis.
As we have previously discussed while we are forecasting strong growth in key emerging markets the 2013 implementation of CMS or the competitive bidding for Medicare patients will impact our U.S sales this year.
In vision care global operational sales increased approximately 2% in the first quarter.
Cataract sales which represent about 60% of our global vision care sales continued to outpace the market in the quarter led by above market growth of our TECNIS brand of intraocular lenses.
We expect continued strong growth in our cataract business with several important launches this year.
This include our recent launch of TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan which provides Abbott access to the largest segment of the Japan market and the expected upcoming U.S launch of our TECNIS Toric IOL.
We also saw continued strong performance of cataract business in emerging markets with more than 30% growth in the quarter.
For the second quarter in our global vision care business we expect low single digit operational sales growth.
So in summary our results were in line with our expectations and we remain on track to meet our full year forecast.
We delivered strong performance in both nutrition and diagnostics this quarter while also executing on a number of new product launches and geographic expansion.
And we expect accelerated growth as the year progresses.
We will now open the call for questions.
(Operator instructions).
Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan.
Good morning.
Can you hear me okay? If I think about the company I thought by the way you guys I thought did an excellent job in laying it out in the press release which is -- you had a lot different details than you have had before.
You have got 40% of the company in emerging markets it's growing 15% this quarter.
You (inaudible) in developed markets that was down like 3% this quarter.
If we think about the acceleration in this whole company over the balance of this year is the developed market piece gets better if you think about it in aggregate or is it the emerging market piece? I think I know the answer but I just want you to flush that out a little bit.
Well it's a little bit of both.
I would tell you that a little bit of improvement in developed market goes a long way but the emerging markets for us are showing pretty strong growth and I would say even a bad day in an emerging market looks a lot better than a developed market right now.
So when we look at some of these emerging markets and even at the very strong growth rates we see there they are a little slower than what we may have historically seen in last couple of years.
So I think it kind of depends.
Unfortunately they are not all binary and separated they are linked.
They are somewhat interdependent.
And I would say we are seeing the roll through right now in the developed markets of the actions austerity actions that have been taken obviously in the last year to 15 months.
And I think that’s going to be with us for a while.
I know the senior management at Johnson &amp; Johnson commented a little bit on that yesterday and I though their comments were quite eloquent about that and quite correct that it's going to take a while for this to roll through and for businesses or companies to lap the actions we have seen in the developed markets.
But a little bit of improvement there as I said goes a long way.
At the same time the emerging markets are still very robust and strong comparatively speaking and frankly even in the absolute.
So you know I think all of us we look at our various businesses it's really as you point out a two-part story.
Developed markets emerging markets and they are pretty different.
And so the tactics or the things that we put in place in any of those markets are different.
We are expanding as rapidly as we can where the growth is.
And we are finding better ways to be efficient and compete more effectively and frankly compete for share in the developed markets.
So at the end of the day while we have given guidance that we expect to be mid to high-single digits depending on how long sort of the economic conditions persist will be towards the mid.
And if it begins to improve we will start to move the other way.
Okay.
Let's take EPD because I think that’s the probably the business where there is probably the biggest range of these on the growth profile of that business.
And if you would look at it this quarter and then what you are expecting over the balance of the year you have got your emerging markets piece which is posting good growth.
Not double-digits but pretty close.
And then you have got your rest of Europe which has been declining it has been a drag.
So if EPD gets better over the balance of the year is that because you are sure to lap some of those cuts that occurred in Europe last year or is it because the emerging markets accelerate? Again it's a little bit of both.
We definitely get better as we lap some of last year.
The developed market part of EPD in some ways has been more strongly hit than any other businesses or that business in developed markets more strongly impacted because of just the direct impact of price cuts in Japan or Europe.
And then of course you have got the Yen on top of it and we have got a pretty significant business in Japan there.
So we have got a disproportionate index on the developed markets in EPD.
So I think as we lap that it gets better.
But at the same time as you pointed out the growth rate of the EPD in the emerging markets is about 9% and frankly I expect that to improve in the latter half of the year.
Okay.
And then one last follow up for Tom.
The gross margin commentary for the second quarter you are expecting a step down from 1Q to 2Q despite having probably $200 million in incremental revenues.
Is that just because of the first quarter was just higher than it normally would be because of FX hedges? Yeah we just had the timing of the flow-through of the exchange really just kind of -- it helped the first quarter a little bit and it will be a little bit of an offset in the second or the last three quarters of the year.
I think the big -- the key message on gross margin is as we look at the full year we are right on track with what we thought we would have as we talked about back in January.
So it’s really just a timing thing Mike.
Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
Just wondering if you’d comment a little bit about maybe what’s going on beneath the surface of SG&amp;A.
there’s a lot of probably activity in emerging markets and maybe talk about some of the investments you’re making there versus what you’re doing in the developed markets to just facilitate the longer term growth verse.
Rajeev this is Miles.
I think that’s a pretty good summary right there.
We’re definitely expanding in growth markets around the world both in headcount and promotional spending and so forth to support that growth and we’re doing that at a prudent rate.
We’re also tightly managing the sales and marketing expenses in markets where we’re not going to get the return or aren’t getting the return.
I would also say a little bit of what’s going on there and you’ll probably see this play out over the remaining quarters of the year.
We’re putting an awful lot of emphasis on our G&amp;A.
it’s not that we want spend less or invest less in our sales and marketing support of our businesses or investment businesses but I do want to run the company at a very efficient level from a G&amp;A standpoint.
And so we’ve put a lot of emphasis on how we are performing in all of our call it overhead or support functions around the world.
It doesn’t matter what country you’re in for that one or what business and we’re looking at any duplication between our businesses and corporate and so on.
Now that we’ve got a little different configuration of the company without the proprietary pharma business it gives us an opportunity to look pretty closely at a lot of our support spending in G&amp;A.
that’s not something we can do in just a quarter but over the coming quarters we’ll definitely be putting some emphasis on that.
And is it enough that you could see that play out in the SG&amp;A? Yes.
The question is driven more towards gee are you too tight on SG&amp;A? I’d say no we don’t feel like we’re starving SG&amp;A.
I think not at all actually.
If we have the opportunity to invest more where we know we can get the return and grow we’re definitely doing that.
There’s a certain pace at which you can do that and a certain quality at which you can do that and we’re mindful of that but we want to make sure we put that investment into the growth of the businesses.
And I say the same with R&amp;D.
you look at the profile of R&amp;D this quarter and it looks like it might be slightly down.
That’s really a timing issue.
We don’t like to shift or reduce any kind of R&amp;D spending at all provided it’s productive.
So we like the notion of investing more in R&amp;D and we like investing it well and we don’t want to make our bottom line based on what we do with discretionary spending in SG&amp;A or R&amp;D.
that bottom line needs to be driven by core performance at the gross margin level and that’s why we’re putting so much emphasis on the gross margin improvement in the businesses which is going quite well.
That not only is good for the investor at the bottom line but affords us more investment capability in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A.
that’s a long winded answer but there you go.
That was very helpful.
And I guess one quick follow up on the product side.
Just wondering if you could talk about the ABSORB product in Europe and what your -- maybe a little bit more granular on what you’re seeing there in terms of uptake and how you expect that to broaden out over the coming quarters.
Thanks.
Well I’d say the uptake is taking a little longer to ramp than we might like but it is coming along pretty nicely.
We’re confident that this is going to be a workhorse stent for us over time and I think the initial trial and positioning of the stent has people trying it and you might even say in its initial launch it looks like it’s going to a very high niche.
On the other hand that’s the starting point to get some experience with physicians and doctors.
It’s our intent to drive it into what I would call very common workhorse use.
And the pace of that is steady.
I think we’re always going to be impatient and wanting to drive it faster.
For a little while it was about having the range of sizes.
We solved that in a number of our markets.
So I expect that to continue to perform pretty well.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Miles I’d thought I’d come back to one of the bigger growth drivers in nutrition and two specific points and maybe a follow up.
There’s been a lot of talk intra quarter about the Hong Kong ban.
It’s pressured some of the peers in the space.
What is Abbott’s positioning on the impact the Hong Kong ban would have if any on the business.
And I guess the second follow would be Ensure I think a business that people are not focusing as much on obviously a launch in late last year.
How you are thinking about ensuring the opportunity in China? Okay.
You know what I am going to let Brian or Tom answer your Hong Kong question because I think frankly the answer is we are not having an impact.
But we will give you more granularity on the impact we are not having.
Yeah David I think -- this is Brian.
We had a great quarter as you could see in nutrition that was driven by strong growth in China.
That dynamic is not our dynamic and I know you and I discussed this a little bit.
We are not as over-indexed in Hong Kong as our competition.
If you look across Hong Kong and China our shares are relatively the same.
So we don’t see this dynamic impacting us but clearly there is an impact on the industry if they make restrictions of products that can cross the border there.
I would say our growth rate in China is pretty robust and we are not seeing that impact.
Frankly our growth rate in Hong Kong is pretty good too.
And your second question was? On Ensure Miles.
Is it too early to start thinking about how big the Ensure opportunity could be in China? Well we are thinking about how big it might be.
I am not sure I can quantify it for you but we think it's a fairly significant opportunity and we are investing to frankly drive and create that market.
And I think there is -- how would I put it -- I think it should be a terrific opportunity for us.
It's a market that I think demographically and from a culture and a usage standpoint is perfect for Ensure.
We are currently as you know investing in capacity for our liquids in the United States.
We will probably -- we will enter that market first with our powder versions of Ensure and then we will transition to liquid then we will add on to our plants or one of our plants in Asia to give us the capacity to manufacture in or near market for Ensure.
That’s one where we are very confident of the opportunity.
I think almost any projection we put together will be wrong but I know it will all be good.
So that’s when we look forward to running out as fast as we can I would tell you.
I think it's a big opportunity.
Okay it's very clear.
Just really a quick follow up for Tom.
Tom if you think about the road map you laid out on the road show for nutrition margin expansion.
Now that we are sort of three-four months post that where do we sit now in terms of where we stand? Are we on plan slightly ahead of plan potentially behind? And then what are kind of the key guide posts in terms of either manufacturing capacity or cost reduction issues over the next several quarters we should be focused on? Well we are ahead of plan.
When you look at the first quarter when you see the Q come out we got to see a really good operating margin for this business.
I think you have to be a little careful with that and we really need to look at this on a full year basis because in the last three quarters we are planning some investments in the business and we are starting up the plants that Miles talked about.
And so I wouldn’t straight line the margin you see in the first quarter out for the full year but as Miles indicated in his remarks year-over-year for the full year we expect 300 basis points of improvement in the operating margin in this year alone.
Which gets us very well on the track towards the target he talked about.
So we are ahead of plan and that business is really clicking on all cylinders when it comes to the margin expansion.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
Just a follow-up I guess on MitraClip.
Given that you guys have had the panel what are your expectations just in terms of whether you are optimistic that the FDA will ultimately approve the product or whether we should just expect to see perhaps some of the other studies before granting full approval.
And then if you could also update just on the performance and sales level in Europe too that would be great? Okay.
I guess Kristen the first thing I would say is we are pleased we got a favorable indication from the panel that we recently held with the FDA.
But I have found over time it's never good to speculate about what the FDA may or may not do or may or may not think.
You know we are hopeful and we are working as constructively as we can with the agency regarding U.S.
But I don’t find it useful at all for us to speculate of put the FDA in a spot or whatever.
You know we want them to work constructively with us and I think the best I can say is we can't predict it and we are not in a position to really comment much further than that.
And then I guess with regard to Europe and the 30 countries that it’s available in today we’re pretty pleased with the performance.
It’s been planted in 8 000 patients and we’ve had good performance with it.
It’s growing quite nicely in the markets where we’re marketing it and growing at a very nice healthy double digit rate.
We’d certainly like to bring it to the U.S for patients who are in the high risk and have no other option and we’ll just see how that plays out.
And then any high-level thoughts just on capital allocation M&amp;A strategy here now that the spinoff is complete? Tom loves it when you ask about capital allocations.
I’ll let him take that.
Kristen as we entered the year it’s similar really to the way we view this even prior to separation.
It’s a balanced approach.
We pay a healthy dividend.
We believe in a growing dividend.
We execute on share repurchase each year and we did some of that in the first quarter and plan to do that this year.
There is some degree of cash buildup and some potential of moderating on the debt level.
So it’s a balanced approach and the cash flow of the company is good.
We’ve projected $4 billion this year.
That gives us a lot of options and it’s more the same as we progress through 2013.
Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
Let me start with the US.
The international performance was very strong but some of the US businesses came in a little weaker than we expected.
Maybe if you could talk about whether there were fewer selling days in the quarter that might have had an impact.
And the three businesses that would be helpful to get some color from you on are Vascular Adult Nutritionals and Core Labs.
And then I just had one follow-up.
Thanks.
Larry this is Brian.
There were some impacts on the selling days.
That’s something we’ve not stressed in the past calls but it definitely impacted our nutritional business to where those sales would have been a little bit higher as well as the vascular side even to a little bit to an extent.
You saw clearly the U.S I’d probably start with where the pressures are on the vascular side that you’re seeing.
With there we have seen some market pressures.
We’ve seen like nearly a 10% decline in this market primarily pricing related and we are down a little bit on a share year over year basis.
However we are gaining share sequentially if you look through the fourth quarter to the first quarter where our share has picked up about a couple of points.
And again Xpedition I would say is early in its launch in the U.S.
and so as we discussed before we expect some continued share gain in the U.S and for that business to pick up as we move throughout the year on vascular.
Larry I would add to that for you I think if you compare just on share in that business versus a year ago I think we’re down about 2 points best as we can tell.
On the other hand we’re on an uptick because we launched Xpedition just after the first of the year.
So I would expect that to pick up.
Pressure in vascular very heavily a market pressure and part of it is competitive and pricing in the market and part of it is just utilization.
I would say one of the benefits we have here looking across all these businesses because we have the diverse portfolio we do and we’re in so many countries we get the benefit of comparing the performances of different businesses across those different geographies.
And I would tell you that as we look at the U.S Japan the European Union Canada et cetera the developed markets and look across the various businesses whether it’s vascular or diagnostics or any of these businesses it’s pretty uniform the growth rates and the market growth rates and frankly the business growth rates and pressures that we see.
You can see the pressure or the economic conditions in the retail markets for our nutrition business.
You can see it in the hospital market.
You can see it in frankly any segment of market the pharma markets and so forth.
They’re all pretty similar and what we take from that obviously we know how we’re doing and we know how some of our competitors are doing and so forth.
What we take from that there is an underlying call it economic malaise or weakens that’s pretty consistent across the developed markets and it’s not unique to the U.S.
It’s not unique to Europe.
It manifests itself in some different ways depending on how the products are paid for or by whom.
Whether it's patient payer or government payer or third party insurer payer or so forth.
But overall they are pretty similar.
And the conditions are such that you have got that headwind in literally all of the developed markets.
And one way or another we are seeing it in each of these businesses.
Conversely in the emerging markets it's just the opposite.
And they are almost uniformly all pretty robust.
They are a little more volatile little less predictable you have got some currency swings here and there and so forth which is why it's great to be in a pretty broad portfolio of emerging markets and not over-indexed in any one.
But the fact is consistently across the board there are pretty healthy growth rates in those markets.
And I would say that the unique distinctions among them pretty much blend out across them whereas there is a lot more consistency across the weakness of the developed markets.
Tom? Just to answer your question on core lab Larry.
We outlined this in the earnings release but there was kind of a comp issue in the blood banking business and we had a really strong unusual order last year that was really non-recurring.
So I would not trend out that first quarter and you should see better performance in the U.S.
on core lab.
Did we answer everything you asked there Larry? You did.
Thank you.
Let me just ask one follow-up of Tom.
Thanks for providing the 2012 quarterly numbers.
It's the first time to get to hear your perspective on those numbers.
And just two things stood out to me.
One is the gross margin came in at about 55% that’s what you are guiding to this year.
And the tax rate was about 25% last year and you are guiding to 21% this year.
So just curious on the gross margin.
Why no improvement in 2013? And second just wanted to understand the tax rate obviously a great improvement from 25% to 21% but just a little bit of color on how you could then achieve 400 basis point improvement and maybe where it can go from here.
Thanks.
Sure.
Thanks Larry.
The gross margin is actually on an underlying basis improving across this business.
We have about a 1% exchange headwind because of lag effect and hedges and the like comparing '12 versus '13.
And we said we talked about this on the fourth quarter call that we would be flattish in gross margin but underlying is improving and it's just kind of tough year from an exchange comp perspective.
So I think that’s pretty consistent with what we have said before.
Regarding the tax rate there are a couple of things.
When you look at the tax rate in this base line clearly it's a carve-out or residual of a carve-out.
You know we ran the whole company the way we ran it and we repatriated for the whole company and this is what shook out relative to the Abbott that we are now running.
So it's just -- that’s one thing to keep in mind.
And really the two things that are causing the improvement over that carve-out if you will is the tax law changes that were enacted and as you know at the beginning of the year for the whole of 2012 we were unable to recognize any benefits associated with that.
And there were certain provisions of that that went beyond the R&amp;D tax credit that were helpful to the company.
And we are seeing a shift of income to a better lower tax jurisdiction shall we say.
Which is kind of a mix effect on income which is helping us to run at the 21% rate this year.
So those are the reasons.
And I guess the other thing I would just note is when you compare year-over-year progress in our growth you know tax is helping it for sure but if you just call that aside and look at operating growth we are still growing at that double-digit level which is again the way we have built and what we hope to sustain the growth profile of this business.
So that’s the explanation on the tax rate.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
I was hoping you could spend a little bit more time on the U.S.
medical devices.
Certainly we can appreciate some of the challenges in the coronary stent market as it relates to pricing and overall utilization.
But I was hoping you could just expand upon it.
Where do you think we are with respect to volumes? The PCI volumes have been down now for several years.
I think was some perception that that was sort of cyclical it's turning out to seem a little bit more secular.
But how should we think about your vascular business going forward? Yeah David this is Brian.
I will start it off here and perhaps turn it over to Miles or Tom for more perspective.
But we have seen on a year-over-year basis the PCIs to your point volume being down approximately 5%.
And we are still continuing to see pricing pressures on a year-over-year basis almost as much as 7%.
You write these things out with the other dynamics of the market.
That was the 10% that I was talking about being down year over year.
I’d say sequentially we still are seeing some modest decline even sequentially in this price and PCI as well.
If you look at some of the news that was out there and Miles mentioned it there’s a lot out there in terms of the healthcare space with some of the health management associations then reporting that there’s certain utilizations that have just flattened off and we still continue to see that pressure.
So for us in the U.S it really is going to be about the share momentum and gaining back as Miles mentioned with respect to the Xpedition launch.
But obviously it’s very similar to what we’ve been talking about throughout this call.
It’s really a tale of two markets.
Developed world we’re more challenged but the emerging markets grew 20% in the quarter in this and we’re seeing double digit PCI in a number of the Asian markets.
So between this MitraClip ABSORB progress Xpedition launch and the like there’s a portfolio of growth drivers that we believe are going to help level off this business and start it back on the growth path globally.
David I think the other thing I’d point out and I think Brian sort of covered it first of all there are two dynamics going on here.
One is BTI volume and one is the price.
The quarter compares to a quarter a year ago.
We also look at the most immediate past quarter the fourth quarter in this case of 2012.
So if you look at the current strength and current sequential trend the difference you see versus a year ago has slowed considerably.
So it’s PCI growth down 5%.
Now on a sequential basis quarter to quarter barely a percent down.
So the rate at which it’s declined would appear to be slowing moderating whatever but it isn’t recovering.
That part is true.
It’s not recovering and the same I could say for price.
Price hasn’t taken a lot of pressure over the last three four five months but it certainly did versus a year ago.
So we look at it both ways.
What’s the case versus year going and how they’re trending right now.
And I’d say both of those factors at least its impact has flattened modestly slightly down maybe but pretty much flattened but it isn’t recovering.
So it’s a pretty as you said it wasn’t temporary.
It seems to be hanging in there.
I think for a lot of the hospital segments frankly and I think hospitals today are even more aware of fixed budgets if not declining budgets and they’re putting a lot of pressure on utilization and or price procedures et cetera as they try to deal with hey we’ve only got so much to spend and we’re trying to allocate it as best we can.
That's helpful.
And then maybe on the emerging markets piece obviously another very strong quarter and you called out some of the highlights in key segments.
What I was hoping you could just spend a couple seconds on is how you view the competitive dynamics stacking up across your biggest businesses and where -- is most of your growth coming from building new categories that didn't really previously exist in markets? Are you taking share? How do locals stack up? I know in China for example there are a decent cadre of local stent manufacturers but your numbers continue to show quite a bit of strength.
Maybe just help us frame out the competitive impact versus the new market development impact in those regions.
I think first of all it’s very heavily new market new growth and that’s why those markets are growing.
As their healthcare system expand as the medical practices expand as incomes expand and so forth you actually see the evolution of two or three sometimes four pricing tiers and segments.
There’s often a call it a high end niche.
There’s a midmarket.
There’s a lower tier and sometimes a very low tier.
All of them are growing and you see a migration of that mid-tier to the upper tiers in some cases.
In a lot of case the multinationals and or exporters that are not local manufacturers in those markets are in those upper tiers and trying to move down and the local manufacturers in the lower to mid-tier is trying to move up.
We see that in almost every business we’re in.
but I would tell you in spite of the fact there’s multiple competitors whether local or multinational and pretty healthy competition amongst us all we’re all being driven by a heavy tailwind of growth in expansion and utilization in those markets as their healthcare system expands.
So you can track in a lot of cases and we were careful to look at this internally not to get too excited about our growth if we are not taking share.
You know we want to be paying attention to whether or not we are winning in these markets and in the competition.
It's wonderful to have the growth but at the same time we are mindful that your competitiveness is measured in your share as well.
So I would tell you that the emerging markets are very very much a tailwind of growth but at the same time we are all mindful of the competition.
Okay.
And then maybe lastly on EPD.
I think one of the things that you had communicated on the fourth quarter conference call was some expectation for moderation of pressure in Europe throughout the course of the year given some of the austerity measures that were in place last year perhaps sort of stabilizing.
Any visibility on that at this point or is that something that we'd sort of have to wait and see how that plays out over the course of the year? Yeah I am afraid it falls into the wait and see category.
No I am not seeing it yet.
It's something we expect in the second half of the year.
But no we are not seeing it yet.
I think what we are seeing right now is the flow-through of the measures in the past as I said 12 months or 2012 there were a lot of pricing actions taken by governments and we are seeing that flow through the business now in the comps.
And I would expect to see us lap some of that and see it moderate in the second half of the year but we haven’t seen it yet.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Rick Weiss from Stifel.
I will start off on the diabetes side.
You are clearly doing well in emerging markets you have softer outlook I assume in part due to the new U.S.
reimbursement lower reimbursement CMS reimbursement for diabetes test strips.
Just if you could give us your perspective on some of the next drivers in diabetes.
Is this sharp reduction in test strip reimbursement reflected in the numbers and maybe remind us of the Medicare and non-Medicare mix in the business in the U.S.
business? Well in the U.S.
first of all I would say it's one of those rare circumstances where you are glad your share is not real high in a particular segment.
I really don’t know if it sounds like some rationalization but we are not -- we don’t have a real high Medicare share.
And we have one of the lowest shares in mail order.
So the CMS competitive bidding that has been put in place in the United States is going to have an impact on all manufacturers.
But it's frankly relatively speaking less on us because we are not highly indexed there.
The business itself has segmented and focused on the high testing or frequenting testing insulin dependent user for quite some time.
And that’s a more robust segment where we have been steadily incrementally gaining some share we have targeted our R&amp;D efforts on next generation sensors and testing on those users that are looking for more than just a test strip and a test.
So looking for a lot more information management lot more user testing and so forth.
So I would tell you that the product lines that we have in development in that business today which I think are very innovative and will have tremendous value for those patients are steadily moving along.
I was just recently out in California meeting with the group for a day and I am very pleased with what I see there.
I think that we have targeted a segment of the market that is a lot less say cost sensitive and much more performance sensitive around what they are testing and information gives them.
And I am thinking that the business is certainly positioned in the right place going forward here over the coming years today and it's a very tough competitive commodity like market for the type 2s and the less frequent testers and in the U.S.
Tom? Rick I would just say that when we went through our planning process last fall I mean it was very clear what was coming in competitive bidding in the business and our plan totally factored in pretty much what had played out in the bidding process.
So we are well covered in our guidance for the evolution of the U.S.
market here.
Good.
And on the EPD side.
You have talked about launching new and different formulations of existing drugs and (inaudible) drugs in the portfolio in new additional geographies.
Can you update us there and your progress there? What we should be looking for on those front? Yeah as I mentioned in my remarks there were 45 of them that came through in the first quarter.
There have been hundreds of submissions made to the various regulatory bodies around the world and one of the things we’re finding is that those regulatory bodies are capacity constrained in their ability to process registrations in a number of countries.
So it’s slower going than we might hope but we’re making progress and it’s something that each of our local regulatory people is working through with the various regulatory bodies in each country.
But we’re making progress with it and as we do it’s gradually expanding the product lines.
One of the things we’re trying to do is prioritize into those registrations that are higher volume higher likely usage and so forth ahead of those that are less so to fill out our product launch.
Trying to get the priority straight.
That’s not always easy to do with the regulatory body because their interests aren’t necessarily the same as our interests.
But we’re making progress there.
And just last Miles I hate to always ask you about acquisition plans.
It's hard to resist since I'm asked -- it's almost the first question I get asked every time I speak about Abbott.
And just I guess your latest thoughts on strategy and focus.
I get asked about your priorities U.S or OUS one business or another.
And maybe talk about the pressure you feel or don't feel to move forward on that front.
Thanks.
I guess I’d answer it a couple of different ways.
I don’t feel any particular pressure because I think there’s a balance between the things you might like to do strategically or look at versus the pricing or the values in the market or whatever the case may be.
We like to think I’m sure every business and competitor out there likes to think that we are prudent stewards of shareholder values and that we make prudent deals and so forth when we do.
Our track record has been pretty good that way.
But we’re mindful of that and I think it depends.
There have been some areas of the business that we’ve wanted to expand obviously and I think I’ve commented in the past.
We’re looking at quite a wide variety of potential things in the device businesses to expand our device footprint and platforms and so on.
But it depends where and when they’re ready and or we like what we see at the value we see et cetera.
So I’d say we’re always active there.
We were not so active last year because first of all I think a lot of things weren’t ready and secondly we were pretty focused on all of the activity with regard to the separation.
But having the separation activity behind us we’re able to turn our attention now to what some of those things may be but it doesn’t mean we’re out on a buying spree either.
I think we tend to be pretty selective.
We always balance it versus the value of the business and what we can do with the business and the capacity of our businesses to absorb additional new things to do because whether it’s big or small it takes a lot of effort to put it into your portfolio and drive it appropriately.
So I’d say we’re actively looking there.
We’re not trying to -- I’d say in the device businesses and so forth we’re not U.S versus not U.S or overseas or whatever.
I think as everyone in this market can tell it’s often faster to be in the markets in Europe than it is in the U.S these days and I think that’s fairly apparent.
But that doesn’t mean you only buy ex-U.S businesses or look at licensing products ex-U.S.
the U.S is still a very important market to us and it’s one in which we have ambitions to keep growing in our device businesses.
So there’s no distinction geographically there at all.
In our EPD business that business is not in the U.S and it has no intention to be.
So any interest we have in properties there that might expand our geographic footprints would all be ex-U.S.
and again we follow that pretty regularly but I have to say the valuations and things that we’ve seen in a lot of cases haven’t made sense to us.
So we’re careful about that.
And then in nutrition I’d say our nutrition business has some interest in some things.
I would characterize them as relatively small and given the growth rate of the business I don’t think there’s any need there.
It would have to be a particular opportunity we thought had robust potential because with the way the business is performing you don’t want to over distract it with an acquisition or integration when it’s hitting on all cylinders like it is.
So I’m sure that kind of describes the waterfront there.
I am intentionally not going to be specific with you about what we may be looking at.
When we were doing our road shows last fall I did get a lot of questions on it from investors and analysts.
And I always get specific questions about specific businesses or specific segments that I realize our investors have other investments in and they are trying to triangulate on interest.
But there is nothing I have been asked about that we haven’t been following or looking at closely or studying or looking at in some fashion.
I think one of the things that makes any company successful in the M&amp;A or licensing area is that you have done your homework and you have been doing it overtime so that when you finally decide to make a move with something you know you have had a lot of diligence and you know why you want to do it and so forth and you are ready.
And I would tell you that that’s always been our practice to kind of be on top of whatever portfolio of opportunities there might be for us.
Okay.
Elan we have time for one more question.
Thank you.
Our final question today is from Glenn Novarro from RBC.
I just had a follow up on the use of cash.
Tom you highlighted the dividend as well as some debt pay down.
But what about share buyback? Is that something of focus and how should we think about shares outstanding? And then I had one more follow-up on the use of cash.
Well I did mention them when I gave my recap there.
Share buyback has always been part of our mix of use of cash.
We have bought a fair amount of shares in the first quarter and it's something we continue to look at as we progress through the year.
So absolutely it's an important part of the mix for us it's a good way to return cash to shareholders and obviously with the view we have about the long term of this company it's a good investment for our shareholders.
So absolutely it's part of the mix and we did execute on a fair amount of that in the first quarter.
Is there a target for shares outstanding by the end of the year? I wouldn’t say that.
I mean sometimes that fluctuates with the stock price fluctuations and the impact on diluted shares.
But what we have is the target for deploying cash into share buyback and we executed on a fair amount of that in the first part of the year here.
Okay.
And then just as a follow up.
I would assume that most of your cash is now sitting outside the U.S.
So if that’s correct how does that impact this is specifically for Miles how does this impact your M&amp;A thoughts.
I would think more target would therefore be outside the U.S.
Well I don’t necessarily target the businesses by -- or the interest strategically by where the cash is.
You know we first look at the strategic fit of any given business of interest to us with the businesses we are in or what we can do with it.
And obviously we look at returns and all the obvious and important metrics that we ought to look at.
And then depending on our access to cash or where that business maybe we have that as a consideration.
But I would tell you we don’t start with that as a constraint we don’t start with it as necessarily the determining factor of where we ought to be hunting or looking.
And our interest outside the U.S.
is because frankly that’s where the growth is and it's an awful lot of growth and we want to feed that growth.
So to the extent that we can invest in that growth we do.
And therefore in some ways it's very convenient to have significant portions of cash outside the U.S.
to support that growth.
Now having said that there are things that we also are interested in that are in the U.S.
and device businesses in particular tend to be U.S.
centric at least as a point of resonance.
And we don’t feel like we are particularly constrained or unable to react to ones that we are interested in to acquire.
We have found it possible to manage our cash and our returns appropriately.
So while I would say it would be nice if the U.S.
government continued its efforts with tax reform at some point which would find a path to allow companies economic repatriation that would certainly be in everybody's interest.
But right now it's not determining where we focus our M&amp;A activity.
Well thank you Elan and thanks to everyone for your questions.
And that concludes Abbott's conference call.
A replay of this call will be available after 11.00 AM Central Time today on Abbott’s Investor Relations website at www.abbottinvestor.com and after 11.00 AM Central Time via telephone at 402-998-0462; pass code 4638.

Thank you for joining us today.
Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call.
All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call.
(Operator Instructions).
This call is being recorded by Abbott.
With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr.
Brian Yoor Vice President Investor Relations.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
Joining me today on the call will be Miles White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Freyman Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail.
Following our comments Miles Tom and I will take your questions.
Before we get started some statements made today maybe forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the expected financial results for 2013.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are disclosed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2012.
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.
In today's conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Thanks Brian.
Good morning.
This morning we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.46 exceeding our previous guidance range and we are confirming our full year 2013 EPS outlook for double digit growth.
Sales increased more than 4% operationally led by continued strong performance in emerging markets as well as Diagnostics and Nutrition.
Abbott continues to deliver on its expectations despite the recent depreciation of several foreign currencies and a mixed global economy.
Before I comment on our results let me address at a high level some of these dynamics.
Our earnings performance was strong despite a more negative impact from foreign currency than we had forecasted in April.
As you know the yen depreciated further over the last few months and was the primary driver of unfavorable exchange.
Several emerging market currencies also weakened late in the second quarter.
This resulted in an unfavorable exchange impact on sales of 1.7% more than our forecast of 1%.
The underlying fundamentals are good however especially around gross margin improvement and expense management which all are progressing ahead of schedule.
As we look at total company's sales our results were strong in our growth markets and in line with our expectations in developed markets.
Sales in developed markets declined about 1% in foreign exchange which was less of a decline than we saw in the first quarter.
Our businesses in these markets are generally more subject to reimbursement and austerity pressures.
However in Diagnostics one of our most durable growth businesses sales in developed markets increased 3% for exchange.
While these markets continue to be challenging we do expect better performance in the second half.
Emerging market sales were $2.3 billion this quarter increasing 13% before exchange similar to our first quarter growth rate.
We built a broad emerging market base that helps to offset volatility that can occur in any one market.
With more than 40% of our business in emerging markets we are well positioned to benefit from the long-term demographic and economic trends that are taking place.
While we can't perfectly predict the macro environment we can manage our business to deliver durable and reliable results for shareholders.
We've done that consistently for years and we are able to do that because we have flexibility.
We plan for contingencies and we often times drive outperformance in other areas of our business.
This quarter we exceeded our gross margin forecast of 54.5% delivering gross margin of 55% as a result of continued progress on our margin improvement initiatives.
We now expect our full year gross margin to exceed our original guidance.
This was the result of continued momentum from margin improvement in Nutrition and Diagnostics where we are ahead of our initial targets.
With that as context I'll provide a high level high-level review of our four business segments before Tom and Brian comment on the details of the quarter.
The Medical Devices second quarter performance was in line with our expectations driven by mid-single digit international growth across vascular diabetes care and vision care and as expected global vascular results improved sequentially compared to first quarter.
We've seen good momentum for many of our recent medical product launches including OptiBlue cataract IOL in Japan as well as ABSORB MitraClip and XIENCE Xpedition expedition which received approval in Japan last week.
On Monday we also announced two acquisitions IDEV which expands our endovascular product portfolio and OptiMedica which gives us an immediate entry point into the laser cataract surgery market.
While organic growth remains our top priority these acquisitions bring Abbott leading technologies to capitalize on growth opportunities.
IDEV's SUPERA stent is on the market in Europe and under FDA review to address the challenges of treating the superficial femoral artery or SFA.
Treatment of the SFA is the largest and fastest-growing segment of the peripheral market driven by the rising rates of diabetes and obesity.
This acquisition rounds out our endovascular portfolio with the best-in-class technology to further penetrate this market segment.
Our endovascular business is approaching $500 million in annual sales and increased 4% operationally this quarter.
OptiMedica's state-of-the-art laser system provides Abbott access to the rapidly developing laser cataract surgery market.
Most cataract procedures are performed manually today but a growing portion of the cataract market is moving to a laser-assisted surgery especially as the market shifts to premium IOLs.
The acquisition of OptiMedica will allow Abbott to have broader reach in the growing cataract segment cataract sales represent more than 60% of our vision care sales and this quarter increased in the high-single digits as we build momentum with several new products that launched in the first half of this year.
We expect to complete both of these acquisitions before year end.
In Nutrition worldwide sales increased 8.5% with equally strong performance in both pediatric and adult nutrition.
International sales increased 18.5% driven by strong double-digit growth in emerging markets.
We have broad reach around the world and have prioritized a group of markets where we are expanding our footprint.
This includes localizing R&amp;D and building out local manufacturing.
Our three new facilities in China India and U.S.
remain on track to come online later this year or early next year.
Abbott's scientific heritage and new product development is critical to our success and leadership in the Nutrition market.
As I mentioned last quarter we are on track for approximately 70 new product launches this year and have completed more than 40 through the first half.
It's not only new products but the world of clinical data that allow us to grow to shape and further penetrate these markets.
For example in our Adult Nutrition business results from a health economic study announced last month demonstrates that supplementing with Oral Nutrition such as Ensure can decrease hospital length of stay reduce hospitalization costs and readmission rates.
With healthcare systems facing unprecedented budget pressures and challenges these results are encouraging and represent an opportunity in both developed and emerging markets.
Nutrition operating margin also increased significantly again this quarter and we are on track to exceed 300 basis points of expansion for the full year.
Our initial target of 20% is well within our reach and we intend to continue to look at ways to exceed that goal.
In our established pharmaceuticals division sales were below our expectations.
Global economic growth forecasts are lower than when we began the year.
Last week the IMF reduced its growth outlook driven by lower growth expectations in Europe and emerging markets and while we are seeing some impact from these market developments we also need to improve our commercial execution.
To that point we recently created two new commercial leadership positions that have separate responsibility for emerging and developed markets.
This will sharpen our focus on the very different market specific needs in this business and enable us to achieve the growth targets that we have set.
We have some work to do to improve how we promote the Abbott brand through various channels whether at hospitals pharmacies or the consumer.
We are continuing to build our product portfolios through registrations targeted for specific markets and geographically we will see a shift in sales to more high growth emerging markets from 60% today to 75% over the next several years which will also accelerate growth.
While we continue to expect EPD sales growth to pick up in the second half we now have more modest expectations for the pace of that acceleration.
We are positive about the growth prospects for EPD and its strategy as we move forward.
We obviously have some things to do here.
Diagnostics continues to deliver on its expectations with worldwide sales up 7.5%.
Sales in emerging markets which represent 35% of total diagnostics sales were up more than 15% in the quarter.
This was led by Core Laboratory Diagnostics where we continue to outpace market growth in our priority markets; China Brazil and Russia.
In Molecular Diagnostics we returned to double-digit growth in the second quarter with sales up 13%.
In June we also launched the first FDA-approved Hepatitis C genotype test which allows physicians to match patients to the best treatment option based on their genotype.
This is especially important as patients will benefit from many new pharmaceutical treatments over the next few years.
The Diagnostics operating margin also came in ahead of our expectations as we continue to execute on our gross margin improvement plan.
Despite the R&amp;D investment we have been making for six new system platforms across our three diagnostics businesses we are well ahead of schedule to reach our initial operating margin target of 20%.
In summary despite currency headwinds our performance exceeded expectations.
We are executing on our strategic priorities and confirmed our double-digit EPS growth target for the full year.
I will now turn the call over to Tom to review our second quarter results and the 2013 outlook in more detail.
Tom? Thanks Miles.
Today we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.46 exceeding our previous guidance range.
Sales for the quarter increased more than 4% on an operational basis that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 1.7% from foreign exchange.
The impact of foreign exchange on sales was 70 basis points more unfavorable in the quarter than the estimate we provided in April reflecting further depreciation of the Japanese Yen and weakening of several emerging market currencies late in the quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses including growth of more than 13% in emerging markets.
Reported sales which include the impact of exchange increased 2.5% in the quarter.
The second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55% ahead of our previous guidance due to the impact of margin improvement initiatives in our Nutrition and Diagnostics businesses as well as a lower headwind from exchange relative to previous expectations.
In the quarter ongoing R&amp;D investment was 6.5% of sales in line with previous expectations and ongoing SG&amp;A was around 31% of sales somewhat lower than previous expectations.
Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2013.
Today we are confirming our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.98 to $2.04 which reflects double-digit growth over 2012 at the mid-point of the range.
We're forecasting operational sales growth that is excluding the impact of foreign exchange in the mid-to-high single digits for the second half of the year.
Based on current exchange rates we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full-year reported sales which was 1.5% more negative than previous expectations.
At current rates we would expect a 3% negative impact on sales in the third quarter and 4% in the fourth.
Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 55.5% which is favorable to our previous guidance primarily due to strong performance in Nutrition and Diagnostics as these businesses continue to execute well on margin improvement initiatives.
We also continue to forecast ongoing R&amp;D of 6% to 7% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A expense somewhat above 30% of sales for the full-year 2013.
Overall we project our full year adjusted operating margin to expand by more than 100 basis points in 2013 somewhat above our previous guidance.
We continue to forecast net interest expense of around $110 million in 2013 non-operating income of approximately $20 million and around $50 million of expense on the exchange gain-loss line of the P&amp;L.
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2013 which we are providing for the first time we are forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.51 to $0.53 which would represent strong double-digit growth at the mid-point of the range.
We forecast specified items of $0.20 in the third quarter primarily associated with intangible amortization expense and cost reduction initiatives resulting in GAAP EPS guidance of $0.31 to $0.33.
Our operational sales growth in the third quarter is expected to be in the mid-to-high single digits.
And as previously indicated at current exchange rates we expect roughly 3% negative impact from exchange on sales in the fourth quarter.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low-to-mid single digits.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55.5% of sales in the third quarter which includes a negative impact from exchange of somewhat more than 1%.
We also forecast ongoing R&amp;D for the third quarter somewhat about 6.5% of sales ongoing SG&amp;A expense of around 30% of sales and non-operating income of around $50 million.
With that I will turn it over to Brian for the operating highlights by business.
Thanks Tom.
This morning I'll provide an overview of second quarter performance and our outlook for the third quarter.
My comments will focus on operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
I'll first discuss Medical Devices which includes our vascular diabetes care vision care businesses.
In our Vascular business worldwide sales were flat on an operational basis a step up than first quarter performance and consistent with previous guidance.
International sales which comprised more than 60% of total Vascular sales increased 4% operationally.
Growth was driven by new product including our XIENCE PRIME small vessels stent in Japan XIENCE Xpedition ABSORB and MitraClip.
Last week we announced the approval of XIENCE Xpedition in Japan which we expect to drive further share gains.
This approval follow the initiation of our ABSORB randomized clinical trial in Japan reaffirming Abbott's commitment to developing truly innovative treatment options for coronary artery disease.
U.S.
vascular sales in the second quarter were down nearly 7% impacted by market declines partially offset by year-over-year share gains as a result of the XIENCE Xpedition launch.
For the third quarter of 2013 we expect our global vascular business to increase in the low-single digits on an operational basis.
We expect to improve our performance in the second half of the year with the uptake of XIENCE Xpedition in the U.S.
and Japan and continue penetration of our new products MitraClip and ABSORB.
In Diabetes Care global sales in the second quarter were relatively flat in line with our expectations.
International sales growth of 4% was driven by double-digit growth in the emerging markets as well as the continued uptake of our FreeStyle InsuLinx Meter.
Abbott was recently selected as the exclusive supplier for the National Diabetes Awareness Program in Saudi Arabia a country where 40% of the population has diabetes today.
In the U.S.
we saw continued share gains in the hospital and retail segments where Abbott maintains its leadership position offset by market pricing and reimbursement pressures.
We continue to invest in the next-generation sensing technology which we expect to initially bring to market in Europe in the second half of 2014.
We project third quarter diabetes care sales growth to be relatively flat on an operational basis.
As we have previously discussed while we are forecasting strong growth in emerging markets the 2013 implementation of CMS competitive bidding for Medicare patients will impact our U.S.
sales this year.
In Vision Care global operational sales increased approximately 2% in the second quarter.
Cataract sales which represent about 60% of our global vision care sales continued to outpace the market in the quarter led by strong double-digit growth in emerging markets and our TECNIS brand of intraocular lenses.
We expect to see continued growth in our cataract business driven by several important new product launches this year.
This includes the recent launch of TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan which provides Abbott access to the largest segment of the Japan market and TECNIS Toric in the U.S.
which gives Abbott access to the faster growing premium segment of the IOL market.
The anticipated launch TECNIS Preloaded IOL in the U.S.
will also contribute to accelerated growth in the second half of the year.
For the third quarter in our global vision care business we expect mid-single-digit operational sales growth an improvement versus first half of the year as we continue to drive cataract growth with new launches and execute in emerging markets.
In Nutrition global sales increased 8.4% in the second quarter on an operational basis.
International nutrition sales grew 18.4% in the quarter including strong double-digit growth in emerging markets which now comprise more than 45% of total nutrition sales.
Global pediatric nutrition sales grew 9% operationally in the quarter.
International pediatric sales grew 19% as we continue to execute on a number of geographic expansion initiatives and launch new product innovations including the global rollout of our specialty tolerance formula products.
U.S.
pediatric sales were down modestly largely due to lower infant formula share in the WIC segment.
Abbott remains the market leader in non-WIC segment of the U.S.
infant formula market.
Global adult nutrition sales was comprised nearly 45% of total nutrition sales increased 7% operationally in the quarter.
International adult sales grew 17% driven by strong growth of Ensure and execution in market expansion initiatives.
U.S.
adult nutrition sales were negatively impacted this quarter by the exit from certain non-core business lines as part of our margin improvement initiative.
Excluding the impact of these exits U.S.
adult sales grew low single-digit.
As Miles mentioned earlier a recent health economic study published in The American Journal of Managed Care found that nutritional supplementation in the hospital setting decreased hospital length of stay and total episode cost by more than 20% and reduced the likelihood of being readmitted to hospital within 30 days by nearly 7%.
As the clear global leader in adult nutrition we are working to expand the market by raising awareness of the role that proper nutrition can play in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.
As we look ahead to the third quarter we expect our global nutrition business to grow double digits on an operational basis with strong international sales growth led by emerging markets and continued uptake of recently launched products.
In our established pharmaceutical business or EPD sales in the quarter were flat on an operational basis as growth in emerging markets was offset by decline in the developed markets.
We continue to expand our presence and build local portfolios in 14 key emerging markets.
Sales in these markets grew approximately 4.5% in the quarter and was somewhat negatively impacted by timing of product deliveries in certain markets as well as implementation of the drug price control order in India which caused some delays in customer purchase late in the quarter.
We expect growth in our 14 key emerging markets to improve in the second half of the year with strong growth in a number of emerging countries including Brazil and India.
As expected growth in other markets which includes Western Europe and Japan was negatively impacted by overall macroeconomic conditions in these countries including European austerity measures.
In the third quarter we expect low single-digit operational sales growth from our established pharmaceuticals' business as we see improving growth in emerging markets due to portfolio expansion and execution of recent tender wins.
Lastly in our Diagnostics businesses Core Lab diagnostics continued its durable growth with operational sales increasing 6% in the quarter.
About 80% of our core laboratory diagnostics sales are generated outside the U.S.
where we saw more than 8% operational growth in the quarter.
Sales in emerging markets increased double digits led by China and Russia both growing more than 30%.
In Molecular Diagnostics worldwide sales increased 13% on an operational basis in the second quarter in line with our expectations for accelerated growth versus the first quarter.
International sales increased nearly 18% on an operational basis led by strong infectious disease growth particularly in emerging markets driven by the impact of new tenders as well as the continued global expansion of our ALK gene test for non-small-cell lung cancer.
In June we received approval for the first FDA approved hepatitis C virus genotyping test in the U.S.
which will enable physicians to create a personalized targeted diagnosis and treatment path to improve clinical outcomes further expanding Abbott's diagnostic testing options in infectious disease area.
In Point of Care Diagnostics worldwide sales increased 15.5% on an operational basis driven by continued growth in the U.S.
Hospital segment further penetration in the U.S.
physician office labs and strong double-digit growth in emerging markets.
For the third quarter we are forecasting our global diagnostics business segment to generate high single-digit operational sales growth driven by continued strong double-digit growth in molecular and Point of Care Diagnostics and mid-to-high single-digit growth in core labs.
So in summary we are pleased with our financial performance through the first half of the year.
We delivered earnings per share in the second quarter that exceeded our previous guidance range.
And despite a challenging global economy and recent fluctuations in currencies we are confirming our 2013 ongoing EPS guidance.
We will now open the call for questions.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
Let me start with a couple of questions for Miles.
Can you hear me okay? I hear you fine.
So Miles how do you view the broader macroeconomic conditions and dynamics both in the developed world as well as the emerging markets including the impact of currency and maybe some color on how this impacts Abbott and your performance in the quarter and beyond? Well I will take the macro environment first.
I think whenever the economies of the world wherever they may be go into some recession or phase into some kind of adversity at least as businesses and investors look at it I think the natural tendency is to always forecast they are going to recover faster than they do.
They recover gradually and I think that's what we are going to see here.
I mean I think if you look back over the last few years and listen to all involve the pundits and analysts and everybody else talk about the macro environment and the pace of recovery and so forth I think optimism and hope and so forth have driven a lot of wishful thinking that it is going to happen faster than it does but frankly the problems of Europe or even the U.S.
have been more serious and deep.
They don't recover that fast so that rolls through to markets and it obviously rolls through to emerging markets too because they are so integral to now the global economy.
So I guess I would look at it and say I think it is all getting better.
I think it is going to get better but it's going to be at a measured pace and I don't think it's going to just suddenly be better and sometimes the trading in the market for the Dow everyday certainly doesn't reflect that.
We have great days of exuberance and others days that aren't so exuberant but.
overall I think it's pretty steady.
Now as I have said in the past there's a pretty big difference here and we can see it in our business between call it emerging markets and very developed economies.
You take the U.S.
Europe Japan Canada et cetera as the developed markets and call the rest of the world evolving or emerging growth markets.
There is a big difference here.
We can see it in our various businesses as we look down the list of our businesses and we look at developed market growth and emerging market growth it's dramatic.
It's consistent.
It's consistent for us except for one business and that one business is a pretty good measure of market health and market performance and that would be our branded generic drug business where it's frankly more our performance than anything else of our own execution.
So we look at those businesses and in almost every case the performance in emerging markets is either very high-single digit or frankly really healthy robust double-digit growth and if you look across the developed markets it's at best single-digit and in a lot of cases flat and declining.
I think we are in a phase where those developed markets are absorbing all the austerity measures and other things that they had to absorb.
So there is a pretty dramatic barbell here between the robustness of emerging markets and the sluggishness of developed markets and we happen to be indexed in both I think that’s a good thing and we are broadly represented in the emerging markets.
As I said a couple of times a bad day in emerging markets is a lot better than a good day in developed markets often.
While those developed markets are very important to us and we have a lot of share a lot of customers and frankly make a lot of profit there as far as growth goes the emerging markets are more robust.
They are volatile sometimes which is why it is good to be in a broad cross-section of them and not over indexed in a couple and we are.
We are very broadly represented across these markets and in a broad group of businesses.
So I would tell you every day there is something concerning some market some country somewhere but overall in the kind of the market basketball that is a pretty strong overall economic picture and performance that I think has great long-term longevity.
Now having said that it translates this volatility in currency too.
As a lot of these countries become a bigger part of our sales or other multinational sales we are adjusting to less obsession about the Euro and a lot moresession about a whole basket of currencies that aren’t nearly as predictable and often aren’t as widely traded and so forth.
So this year the Yen has been a significant driver of negative currency as I think is understood by all of our investors and shareholders and analysts and yourself and so on.
In addition some of the more or larger emerging markets like the BRICs have also contributed lately to that but I have to say this year it is pretty much dominated by the Yen.
So in any given year it’s a different currency that could impact our sales and because the company is 70% or more international that’s something that we have to expect to manage and navigate all the time.
I would tell you that our shareholders and investors don’t expect to ride that curve with us they expect us to manage that for them and manage the overall durable performance of the company and we do and as we are this year.
It's helpful.
Just one follow-up for you Miles.
So your performance in nutrition continues to be strong particularly in emerging markets.
How should we think about the dynamics taking place in China around the infant formula market? Secondly the sustainability of the extremely high growth this quarter for adult nutrition outside the U.S.? Thanks.
I would say it is there’s anomalies all the time in comparisons and so forth in any given segment of our business but I would tell you that the demographics and the underlying market factors around our adult nutrition business are all good and they are all positive.
While I would never even let myself think that some extremely robust growth rate is sustainable indefinitely I would tell you that the growth rate of our nutrition business internationally I think is pretty sustainable for a long time because all the underlying demographics whether the adult and pediatric business are all pretty good right now and I think for the foreseeable future.
With regard to the China I would say I think most investors and most observers understand what's going on here what's happening here.
The government is stepping in to say this market perhaps has become a little too robust in a number ways and one might even speculate to the disadvantage of Chinese companies and I think the government has been clear that it wants to improve it's dairy industry and improve the circumstances in that market.
As you know they had some issue several years ago with the quality of dairy product and so forth and you got to admire the fact that they make it a point to say "Hey we're going to pay attention to this." And at the same time they are paying attention to how these markets are developing.
I mean they are looking at not only Nutrition they are looking at pharmaceuticals they are looking at packaging companies.
They are looking at a number of things.
I think China is an unbelievably impressive country and I think it's an impressive government that's managed its economic development incredibly well.
I think this is a small piece of that.
In fact in almost any way you kind of look at it and say off all things you think that the government would pay attention to infant formula wouldn't make the top of most industries or businesses or list but in this case along with pharmaceuticals packaging and a number of other industry segments it did.
So I think we can manage this I guess is the way I would put it.
My sense of prospects for the Chinese market haven't changed opportunity remains strong opportunity remains robust.
I think all the companies that have been mentioned as part of this investigation have all responded very cooperatively to the Chinese government.
I don't know that from talking to anybody but I have read the press reports and so forth.
I know that we've cooperated with their investigation and this too shall pass and I think the market dynamics remain robust.
Fortunately for us China does not represent a disproportionately large portion of our Nutrition business or even our pediatric nutrition business.
It's a big business for us there and we are big there but we are so broad across so many countries that it does not disproportionately impact our performance so our prospects and forecasts haven't changed our EPS forecast haven't changed.
We've obviously modeled all that in great detail to the degree that we can.
And to the extent that there is any impact on us financially we believe it is manageable in other ways.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Good morning.
Miles just a quick question on (Inaudible).
It probably was the only business this morning that is performing that's not a point at or above expectations and I wondered if just give us a sense of whether that you think that is more developed market pressure.
Is that more just Abbott's delays with emerging market registrations and I think over the last three to four months a lot of your peers saying this is not a particularly interesting business and maybe you can just comment in terms of the quarter and your views have they changed at all about the ability to drive growth in this segment? I would tell you my over views haven't changed at all.
I am glad our peers don't think it's interesting because we don't need no peers.
There's plenty of competition in these markets today.
I think these markets are developing exactly as we forecasted and I think the opportunity is what we forecasted.
I think the biggest distinction here and I don't think it's very well understood by a lot of people is that the branded generic pharmaceutical businesses around the world are different than commodity pharmaceutical or generic pharmaceuticals and they are very different than proprietary research based pharmaceuticals.
And I think one of the execution issues we've had is more of a cultural or philosophical business approach issue because we have been so dominated by our research-based pharmaceutical business in the past.
You have a business mindset around how you execute against that business and I think it's one of the reasons why few companies have succeeded at having proprietary pharmaceutical businesses and generic pharmaceutical businesses in the same company and I have said in the past I admired them to sell off or be one of the first pioneers of that at Novartis but we separated them into Novartis and Sandoz and I think rightly so because the way you operate those businesses the whole marketing approach is just very different.
If I had to say there is one particular thing that has been a shortcoming for us I think we or our management team have approached this too much like proprietary pharmaceutical and not enough like the different kind of business that it is.
This is a business that's very consumer-facing in a lot of countries very brand-dependent very product line-dependent meaning breadth of product line and so forth.
It's very different game.
And I don't think we have made that transition yet as well as we should happen and I think that's where we would diagnose ourselves as not having executed as well as we should have.
Part of that's registration timing part of it's the mix of product therapeutic areas and so forth available part of it's just our own knowledge and expertise in those areas.
So we have separated the markets into two big segments but the fact of the matter is that the countries are all quite different.
In any case the developed markets have common characteristics emerging markets have common characteristics and we have got to do a much better job of making the adjustment to a branded generic pharmaceutical business.
I would say that while a lot of our peers don’t view this as attractive there are some of our peers who do and I think we know who our longer term competitors are and who they will be.
We think the opportunity is robust.
We think we are underperforming and by any measure whether we look at competitor performance our performance market performance share et cetera we are underperforming.
It pains me to say it but we are.
The good news in that is I think we can change that and we are taking the steps to change that.
So I think our development of this business is going slower than I might like and it sticks out like a sore thumb relative to everything else but nevertheless expectations of the business and what I think it could do for us remains the same.
It’s a very profitable business.
Gross margins in the close to 60% range.
So it’s a very attractive business I think executed like.
There hasn’t been a long historic track record in these markets in this kind of a business as we have developed.
So there is a lot of pioneering going on here and pioneering by us and Santa Fe and some other great companies that I think understand these markets and are all trying to position themselves properly for the growth of these healthcare systems.
So I remain pretty enthusiastic about it.
You asked me about developed markets and I would tell you that part of this business is declining and it is experiencing all the same pressures that all the businesses in Europe are.
Europe in particular is tougher with generic products whether branded or commodity or otherwise and so we are certainly experiencing that too.
If there is any part this I am most disappointed about it's our performance in the emerging side.
I expect what's happening in the developed side to keep being that way for a while.
I think we can mitigate that to some degree too.
But the bigger issues here for us is how we are doing in the emerging markets.
Miles that’s very very helpful.
Then just maybe a quick follow-up.
Either persistent investor a question (inaudible) in order for Abbott to transform their growth there seems to be the view that you need transformational acquisitions and I guess in your guidance the mid to upper single-digit growth in the back half of the year which is ahead of your peers you could choose small incremental deals.
So can you talk to us about the deals that you have done in the last June in recent days is that more indicative of the kind of deals that we should see and does Abbott need frankly a larger multibillion-dollar transaction to transform the growth rate? I love the question.
If you watch me or us over the last 10 to 15 years one thing I think you can consistently say is I have never forecasted to anybody what we are doing or what we are looking at or whether you can expect us to be interested in M&amp;A activity.
So I am going to waffle here and not give you a clue.
I wouldn’t want to indicate that there is a trend here of what we are interested in any way shape or form.
I would tell you that I always remain vigilant and watchful about what opportunities may exist for us from a lot of perspectives both conventional and unconventional and you have seen that over 10 to 12 years.
There are times when smaller what you call bolt-on or whatever supplemental acquisitions fit and they enhance the given business then there is other times you make a bigger move.
Whatever it is the timing of those moves tend to be driven by opportunity valuation circumstances in the markets and so forth.
One of the things that I think has been a hallmark of our success at least on the M&amp;A side it has been that we have done a lot of study we followed businesses we follow the market and follow various things that we are interested in the target for a long time done a lot of due diligence and so forth and by the time the opportunity drifts into the radar screen in the right way with the right stars aligned and circumstances we generally are pretty ready with a fairly well-developed point of view on valuation and so on and will act on the opportunity.
The problem is you can't always predict when that’s going to be.
We can't predict it any better than you can so we can certainly can't forecast it to you but if you ask me is there a set of opportunities that we are always watching or always looking for that might be enhancing the business the answer is yes.
As I have said many times in the past I am mindful that investors are not looking for things that dilute the current performance of the company and it's also a hurdle for us that we have to know we are going to do with the business and do better with it if we own it and earn and incremental positive return for the investor over and above what it might do standalone.
I will tell you there is a number of things we've looked at out there where I think valuations are just out of this world stratospheric and unrealistic and that we've walked away from a lot of things because we thought valuations were unrealistically high or expectations were unrealistically high and I don't think there's a particularly robust shall we say opportunity set out there in a number of fields today.
There might be a lot of things for sale but they may not be for sale at a reasonable valuation and I think investors who are interested in that sort of part of us should know we are careful buyers.
We buy when it make sense and when it adds to our business and when we can meet our criteria and when we can do it right for you.
And if valuations are too high or we can't make a strategic argument to you of why it's worth whatever it may be then we don't make the move and that doesn't mean we are only going to do the review as you just saw the fact that they both had announce the same day was pure coincidence.
And we respond optimistically when the opportunity presents itself but it's not reacting reviews have been pretty well prepared so I don't know if that gives you some context but we always remain vigilant in looking.
And for those who think we need something transformative my e-mail is public.
You can send me those ideas.
Thank you.
Our next question is Mike Weinstein from JPMC.
Good morning Miles.
Thanks for taking the questions.
So Miles if I just kind of step back and talk about the first half of the year your accounts were a little bit difficult but I think you would agree that 3.8% of constant currency is kind of not your target for overall Abbott so other than better execution in the EPD is there anything else that you think is kind of key to getting you to kind of what you originally were hoping which was more mid-to-high single digit? Well you know there's two businesses that have been a drag on us.
One is our performance in EPD and one has been the entire vascular market which you know because you watch pretty carefully and know better than anybody but I would say those two things have been a bit of a sluggish drag.
No question.
And I think we are improving both of those.
The evidence of that remains to be seen in EPD and I understand the skepticism of investors or analysts on that one but I am reasonably confident of EPD.
I am just frustrated with the pace here.
On vascular the sequential improvement here is pretty good and our share positions in our core markets is pretty good.
I mean we've got leadership share positions in core stent businesses and so forth.
I think as it's been pointed out a number of times our ambitions here are frankly to expand product lines in areas and geographies and so forth and drive a little better growth profile of that business in what is clearly and austere market.
However that still isn't going to be some high double-digit rate or something as you know.
So I am pleased with the progress there but it's not going to look like it did five six year ago.
So we look at expanding and growing in new segments there and you saw a little bit of that earlier in the week with the acquisitions admittedly modest in size.
The comment you make about the comparisons in the first half of the year first half of the year comparisons they were tougher.
Not even modestly tougher we had difficult comparisons in the first part of the year and just as difficult as those were I would tell you the comps in the second half of the year are equally sort of robust and the opposite direction.
I mean we've got really comps in the second half so the growth rates that we are going to see here on the bottom line I look at and they pretty heady and pretty high and we'll hit them but I certainly wouldn't want you to [trend] line them for the long-term in some respects.
They are not one-time but they more accurately reflect I think the underlying performance of the business.
The underlying performance that grow perform of the business is better than we saw in the first half.
And for the long-term probably not quite as robust as the mid-20% range you are going to see in the second half here.
I am talking on the bottom line.
Because if you look at the guidance and so forth we know we modeled.
We understand what things we've lapped in the comparisons that get better or disappear and so forth and so EPS growth rate in the second half mid-20s.
So that's pretty heady and I fear that you will say okay then we will just take that and straight line it through 2014 and you will just keep delivering at that level.
Somewhere in there is the reality and I think the reality is quite healthy.
We always target double-digit earnings growth and in fact if you look over a lot of the last 10 years whatever it has been we set our guidance in that range practically every year.
We set a high hurdle.
We set a robust hurdle.
We set a hurdle of being reliable double-digit EPS growth and then we do our best to beat it and generally speaking I would say we have done about 90% on the time that beat part.
So I think those kind of dynamics still exist.
At the beginning of the year I told you we did not rely on the markets improving for this to better and we have not.
We have the same questions a lot of other people how much to rely on market improvement to factor into our business.
I think if these markets improve a little bit we improve a lot but I think right now what we are looking at is pretty good growth rates that are a lot more reflective of the identity of the company its growth the mix of its businesses and so forth going forward as we communicated last year and early this year.
And we knew the first two quarters will be tough at least tough from a comparison standpoint and they have been.
Unfortunately they don’t reflect what we think the company is going to look like on an ongoing basis.
Now that said all of us look at the top line too the measure of sustainability overtime of the businesses and I think Nutrition Diagnostics even EPD and the improvements they will have in some of these businesses are going to drive a lot of that growth and then the extent that we have any supplemental opportunities in M&amp;A we will look at that.
But we don’t factor that in because unless you have got it in your hand you cannot count on it.
I just want to follow-up on the vascular piece if I could.
So there is really two questions here.
So one is could you just talk about the evolution of the absorb strategy relative to that product and where it fits in the marketplace.
If we really went back a year plus ago the thought was with prices had a super premium and trying to make it become 10% of the market on a volume basis the 10% volume might mean 30% from revenue.
Now last year obviously that has changed a lot.
It is still priced at a premium but nowhere near what we were talking a year ago.
Is the goal for that to be a workhorse product? If so where are you on tracking towards that goal? Then the second question is on this week's acquisition which really would be just from a strategy standpoint why does Abbott and developer of XIENCE and IDEV Technologies need to go outside to buy a stent platform? Thanks.
Okay let me talk about the drug first.
Your characterization is exactly right.
I think initial entry or strategy of that product was priced as a very new technology which I think niched it in to selective use.
There was a very intentional decision on our part to drive it toward workhorse use just as you characterized.
To do that I will take Europe as an example most governments frankly the U.S.
is the same longer-term but if most health institutions hospitals governments payers et cetera are operating pretty much on fixed or pressured budgets making room for technology that cost more than what it replaces is not high on their list.
So I think that what we have to acknowledge is if we want that product in broader workhorse use then not only do we cannibalize ourselves but we take share from the competition.
But the only way we do that is not to be an incremental burden to the budgets that have to pay for those products as a philosophy.
So quite frankly intentionally the price of that product has come down and its share and its penetration and its use is broadening.
It is our intent to move it into workhorse status.
I would say we are seeing that in increased volume increased usage increased pickup increased account pickup and so forth and that we are seeing it in the sequential sales performance of the product and its position in our portfolio.
So that’s exactly what we intend and we were moving that as fast as all the circumstances will allow without artificially distorting the markets.
So I think you characterized it quite right.
Remind me again what was the second question? IDEV the position of that in the business.
Why would you go out and spend? Quite frankly we like their product.
We like their product a lot.
We wanted to enhance our own offering and surely.
You know can you do it yourself? Yes.
You could but clearly thought we had the activity going in that area but this is quicker and we think better and we like the product so it made sense to us to enhance our product line and accelerate the business and fill it out because the endovascular businesses is core standalone business and needs a strong position in this place so we think that what IDEV gives us so we think that not only helps us in that little space we think it helps the endovascular business strategically as a package.
Okay.
Thanks Miles.
Did I get all your questions there mike? Yes.
You did.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
Just wondering if you could help out on the EPD business and I think you mentioned that the market growth rate is still relatively healthy and I was wondering if you could provide what the rest end of the market growth rate is and help us understand what price volume is that's driving that.
Thanks.
I can't give you a specific market growth rate because it's different for every country and every market.
And one of the difficult for this business Rajeev is we think of a given geography as sort of three different segments.
There is a proprietary pharma segment in our market there is a commodity generic segment in the market and there is a branded generic segment in the market.
And those different segments exist in practically every country.
The question is dominance or prominence in given economics strata in those markets.
I mean India is just a great example to point at because you've got all three there.
It's very much a branded generic market even a branded market at a lower price points in rural settings.
For that reason we've got two brands in India.
We've got True Care and we've got Abbott and True Care is a world brand and at different price points different product and different mix of product and the Abbott brands tend to be in the major urban areas and so forth.
So it depends.
And generally speaking around the world there aren't many data sources for us to get breakouts that way of those markets.
So we know we know we know for being in the market we know from the way we can segment.
So we don't even quote percentages of share because quite often it's contaminated with patented product or other so I can't really give you that but by country or overall I think the segments are easily mid-to-high single-digit market growth and our growth over that considerably higher where we get the strategy right and we have the breadth of the product line and brand position right and so forth and our history and experience here has been we grow much faster than the underlying market when we got those conditions in place and then the price trade off is such that it stratifies like a lot of markets there's low priced product there's mid-priced product.
I can't say high priced.
There's nothing high priced about it.
We are pretty good value in every market but the consumer does make a distinction or the pharmacist makes a distinction between the brands he believes in and the quality the breadth of offering or the configuration of the offering or whatever the case may be.
So we tend to get a premium for the quality the breadth of the brand and the offering that we have.
So it's very much as I have said in the past like our Nutrition business from the standpoint of the mix of consumer-facing and medically recommended or prescribed and a branded product that comes from quality or international source or multinational source tends a get a pretty good share of the market at a pretty good price point.
Thanks.
And just a follow-up I think Abbott has been pretty good operators of those in the markets that participate this one as you mentioned probably not where you wanted to be at this point in time but what's the reasonable expectation for folks to have or this business to get to more of a market rate of growth.
Well I am little gun shy about forecasting one because I have been wrong thus far but I think this is going to get to a mid-to-upper single digits sort of performance rate.
The question is how fast and then I have got my own ambitions which I am already late on.
So you always think as soon as you change management you put new strategies in place that somehow next quarter it is going to look better and I think this is going to take a few quarters before we start to see the green shoots come up and the new growth come.
I am impatient about that but I think we are not going to see what I would like to see in terms of the sequential momentum hopefully until sometime next year.
Thank you our next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair.
I wanted to follow-up Miles on the comment about the two new heads that you hired in EPD and maybe talk a little about where they are located what they are charged with and when you think they may be able to have an impact on the businesses? Well I think they are having an impact already.
One of the people we hired was from outside the company with a strong background frankly in generic and branded generic product marketing and he has got a broad experience absolutely fabulous experience and pedigree and track record.
He is going to be responsible for the emerging market part of the business and we are changing out call it the marketing team and branding team that will support him in that business.
So he is already in place already pretty much up to speed.
He is already familiar with us.
He knows the markets well.
Te knows the channels well.
He knows the brands well and so forth and I think that is going well.
The other position we elevated from internally and one of our experienced and frankly I would say excellent performing managers who has a developed side and I would say given the background of his experience has the right balance of what I would say the characteristics of European and developed markets in the pharma and generic spaces but also the background and experience to understand how to transition where we can to branded generic consumer facing type marketing.
We have taken some of our experienced people from that background like we have seen in emerging markets and supplemented his team with that.
Because I think we have got a transition going on in some of these emerging markets to much broader branded generic marketing more consumer related.
So we are supplementing their teams that way.
All of them are located in Europe together at the company or division headquarters which is (inaudible) and they are all working there together so that they are with each other every day and whether it is emerging markets or developed markets they share quite a bit from the standpoint of the marketing branding and commercial teams but the commercial teams and the support are all dedicated to each of their specific segments so that they are able to customize what we are doing either strategic or from a marketing standpoint for each of those segments.
You firmly have to go down paths whether it is acquisition path or build internally to enter new emerging markets.
But does this strengthen the ability to maybe use the latter if the pricing on the former is too high? Well I think first of all we have to get our house in order which we are doing and getting our strategy straight and the right people in place and so forth which we have done.
I would say okay so far so good.
Let's get our strategy working internally here the way we want to before we complicate life with an acquisition or something else.
If an acquisition or an opportunity presented itself that fit and fit well with what we wanted to in a given geography well we would certainly look at it.
I would tell you and I think all us know this but I would tell you that today the valuation expectations for most of those are just out of sight.
The acquisition we made of Piramal in India was a pricey acquisition but it give us the number one position in the market by far in a profitable growing key large market.
That was worth something and when we look at that long-term that’s worth a lot.
But a multiple valuation like that in markets where all you can be is fit or safe or something isn’t that kind of multiple.
I think today what you see out there is valuation expectations that are frankly just unrealistic.
If that doesn’t change we will be doing this organically.
I think you have to be balanced or disciplined about the returns you expect and the hurdles you expect.
The old adage that anything is for sale as long as it is an overwhelming compelling price and I think if its an overwhelming price it better have a good returns for our shareholders or they are not think we did a good thing for them.
So it's not like you can just go out and create M&amp;A activity.
It's got to have the right intersection of valuable for both side and today I would tell you in this particular space you don't see and that is why you do not see very many deals getting done by anybody buying anything to expand their footprint.
I mean our peers may say gee it's an unattractive market.
I don't think the markets are attractive all.
I think some of the M&amp;A's are unattractive but that just means you got to go at it more organically over time.
And frankly if that's how it is we'll go at it organically.
Okay.
Then one quick topic change but going back to China.
This is second time in two three years that we've seen a pricing disruption whether it's market based or government based.
How do you think about that in terms of investment.
How do I think about that? I think about that but we're probably going to see it again in a couple of years.
I think you are going to see it over and over again like I don't know I have a lot of things I could say about I suppose but I think you see this stuff all the time.
I think if you are over obsessed about China you would over obsess about China.
If you are over obsessed about Brazil or India or Russia or somewhere else you get over obsessed about any one of them.
Is there a headache every day? Yes.
Somewhere.
Overall we're in a lot more than China so I look at this and I think I suppose we should learn to deal with these sorts of things and rolling ongoing basis because I don't think they stop but I think what it does say is you don't necessarily want to be disproportionately indexed in a given geography if you can't take the volatility of ride.
And so for us we're in a lot of geographies purposely and we know that the balance of that mix of geographies is what stabilizes that volatility because it offsets to some degree and that overall we can deliver much higher growth more reliably on a sustainable basis.
But in the backroom here we are managing volatility every day.
So the way I think about it is we are going to be managing volatility every day and I stress to the management team we got to be always kind of preparing plan B and what are you going to do and contingencies and so forth and that is a fundamental part of our whole planning and budgeting process all the time.
And if you look this year six months seven months end of the year has the year gone like you would expected? The answer is no.
Have we delivered the earnings we committed? Yes.
We've exceeded them.
So I think you got to kind of plan that way every year.
Sure.
The only question Miles is really what's the risk that other countries start to follow the model? We saw in Japan historically every couple of year big reimbursement cut China is now taking up the mantel and canister and other countries as their healthcare cost rise they say worked over there why not here? So how do you think about that exposure maybe over the five-year window? Then (Inaudible) incremental given kind of that risk of the broadening.
Possibility I guess exists but the circumstance has tend to be pretty unique in given country.
There is regimentation in Japan around price management from the government or price control from the government that every year or every two years depending what are devices pharma or what are the segment and it tends to be a fairly predictable regimen.
And what it tells you is you want to be very close to your markets you want to have your medical affairs government affairs regulatory affairs people in country in markets.
You can't have those relationships from Europe or U.S.
or something and expect to be into markets every day.
So I think it's possible that similar philosophies could exist other places but what it basically boils down to is kind of that age old.
They want to buy it for less and we want to sell for more.
And life's a negotiation and it just keeps going that way whether it's Europe or China or Japan or India or anywhere else the ability to earn a return is always subject to certain negotiation of what a payer can pay or will pay for the service of product you provide.
I think that's just part of the business.
We have time for one more question.
Thank you.
Our final question today is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Hi Miles.
Good morning and thanks for taking all these questions and give us some really useful color.
I do have a couple of questions.
I think one could ask Tom or Brian one or two it would be okay.
No chance this morning.
I have got a couple of questions but I would like to just lead off on margins because I think it's the most important thing that hasn't been talked about yet on the call.
I mean it's a very nice quarter evidencing that the two lines of [Abbott] one is great broad top line growth.
And the second point we've got some great underlying margin expansion to look forward and that's what seem to really help out this quarter.
I was very encouraged by the commentary around nutrition and the margins there.
I wondered if you could just give us a bit better view here is the cadence of delivering I know there is margin improvement or can you give us a bit more color if it is going to run longer or shorter in terms of timeline and how much further beyond the 20% of sales do you think right now we can get to given that you seem to be overdelivering there? I would say first of all that the performance in nutrition is the result of fairly detailed comprehensive plan with literally over 100 different initiatives and so forth.
Some of those are quick and easy and some take more time.
Some of it's mix of products.
Some of it is manufacturing process.
Some of it whether we make our own product or source it from a third party manufacturer.
There is literally hundreds of things.
We have made great progress and I think there is frankly a lot more to be made.
We have commented in the past that we are fortunate to have some early public comparisons to some of our competitors for some of our segments that give us some benchmarks to sort of judge how we are doing in given places.
But I think there is more here.
This is what I would say.
As much as you would like to get even greater forecast out of me I am always trying to get it out of the business too because there is that caution of let's not fully commit all of it to Miles and Tom and the corporation.
So we leave ourselves a little cushion because as I just explained to this question everybody is thinking about contingencies too.
But the fact is the organization has got a cultural mindset around cost management investment management expense management.
We do make a distinction internally between that which will drive improved gross margin before discretionary spending and the management or proficiency of discretionary spending.
A lot a lot of times you can go out and just cut SG&amp;A but to make a quarter but frankly I think that is kind of quite shortsighted.
In our case on the discretionary side if we look there for efficiency or cost management we are looking at primarily G&amp;A or we are looking at where spending is valuable versus where it is not so valuable.
Bang for the buck hit rate et cetera.
So Tom and I over the course of this year and partly as the exercise out of split and the transition service agreements and the back office stuff with AbbVie we are looking at the manner in which we support all of our businesses and the cost of that support and how we do it and so forth to make ourselves more efficient and I think when you go through an exercise like the split it’s the time to do that.
It certainly allows you the ability to do that to look at whether you can spend your general and administrative expenses better and more efficiently and so on and we are.
Because I wouldn’t want investors to misthink that somehow we are shortchanging the businesses or starting the businesses from the standpoint of R&amp;D investment or sales and marketing because we are not and we don’t have to.
So we do make a distinction about moderating spending and where and how so that we don’t harm the longer term prospects of the businesses but the longer-term sustainable improvement in profits frankly tend to be above that gross margin line and the real cost or pricing the mix of your products how you manufacture all those sorts of things.
But that’s where this is coming from in nutrition.
This is not because they are raising price.
This is all fundamental cost and structure management about the way they conduct that business.
This is very durable and long sustainable profit improvement.
And there is a lot more here I think.
And we think and we know the plan to get and I am going to let Tom add to that if you will for a minute.
I would just say that (inaudible) to your original question I think things are ahead of schedule and you are seeing it in the gross margin.
We are delivering above expectation and it really is a function of executing programs I have more quickly more efficiently and getting more savings sooner than what we might have expected a while back.
So that’s primarily what's happening and obviously the closer we get to the 20% initial target that we have for each division then the focus is going to be on what s more and how much better we can get beyond that and we are making very good progress getting towards those initial targets and we are going to keep working on improving beyond that.
I will just try one extra last quick question if I can.
I know the time is short but in terms of the M&amp;A you said you don't want to be very specific.
You did mention in EPD product breadth as being one of the issues now.
A lot of the large cap pharma companies are looking to separate or breakout many of their established pharma businesses.
Do you see opportunities in some of those reorganizations to potentially and augment what you have in your EPD business? I can't comment on what any of the other companies may have or what they intend to do with their assets but I can tell you this.
It would be of interest if it stood geographically.
It's not that we lack products or lack breadth.
We have breadth.
We've got tremendous breadth in our EPD business that the value primarily to any kind of M&amp;A addition to EPD is geographic footprint or share footprint in a market.
You know how larger share position or brand position may be in that market.
So for us it will more likely be a consideration of geographic enhancement or geographic fit that it will be breadth of product line because we are not challenged from a breadth standpoint.
The opportunity is really in bigger geographic footprints so that would be kind of how we look at it.
And to the extent that those assets out there that may sit back we'll have a look but today I cannot I should say I don't really have a point of view because I haven't seen those assets yet.
So thank you Elan and thank you all for your questions.

Okay thanks Brian.
Good morning.
This morning we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.55 ahead of our previous guidance range strong performance across our businesses as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion expense controls and lower tax rates enabled us to deliver strong double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth despite the impact of a supplier recall in International Nutrition.
We also announced this morning a 57% increase in Abbott's dividend demonstrating our confidence in the long-term growth of the company and our commitment to increasing shareholder returns.
This declaration increases our quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share from $0.14 a share effective with the dividend to be paid in February 2014.
Reviewing the results for the quarter in more detail total company sales increased 4.3% operationally but excluding the sales disruption in International Nutrition sales would have increased approximately 6%.
Sales growth in International Nutrition was affected by the supplier recall initiated in early August in China and two other markets for certain pediatric nutritional products.
While there were no health issues associated with the recalled products and the supplier subsequently determined the products had been safe for consumption the recall created significant disruption in these markets.
As a result International Pediatric Nutrition sales were significantly lower than our previous expectations in the quarter.
We anticipate that it will take time to work through the impact of this supplier recall and expect lower sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first half of 2014.
We initiated additional marketing investments in the third quarter in these markets as part of our recovery plans.
The long-term fundamentals of this business have not changed.
Demand for both adult and pediatric nutrition is strong and we remain optimistic about our growth prospects.
Excluding the impact of this disruption International Pediatric Nutrition sales would have increased in the strong double digits.
Reviewing the results of our other businesses in the quarter Performance was in line with or ahead of expectations.
Diagnostics delivered double-digit growth and Medical Devices delivered nearly 4% growth with double-digit growth in Medical Optics.
We again saw a strong growth in emerging markets and also began to see better performance in developed markets.
Total company sales in developed markets increased in the low-single digits which was ahead of our expectations and a sequential improvement over the second quarter.
Abbott's leading market share position and the introduction of new technologies are driving profitable growth in these markets.
Diagnostics one of our most durable growth businesses increased more than 6% in developed markets with double-digit growth in point-of-care and strong growth in U.S.
Core Laboratory Diagnostics driven by several large customer account wins.
Medical Optics also contributed to our improvement in developed markets.
Growth of our Cataract business has accelerated over the last three quarters driven by new product launches including the TECNIS Toric in the US and TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan.
Total company emerging market sales in the quarter increased 8% operationally driven by double-digit growth in each of our three Diagnostics businesses as well as high single-digit growth in Medical Devices.
Excluding the sales disruption in International Nutrition emerging market sales in our Nutrition business would have increased in the high teens.
In Established Pharmaceuticals this quarter sales increased modestly.
While recent macroeconomic and market pressures in certain emerging markets resulted in somewhat slower sales growth this quarter growth rates in emerging markets have been and are expected to continue to be higher than the growth rates of the developed world and the overall global economy.
Established Pharmaceuticals remains well aligned with the fundamentals driving long-term growth in emerging markets a rising middle-class improving access to healthcare and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for high-quality brands.
Emerging markets are projected to drive 70% of the global pharmaceutical growth over the next several years and the majority of that growth will be from branded generics.
In addition to sales outperformance in several businesses we delivered strong gross margins and operating margins.
Adjusted gross margin was nearly 56% in the quarter ahead of our expectations with strong execution in both Diagnostics and Nutrition.
Adjusted operating margin was 19.3% a 210-basis point improvement over the third quarter of last year.
We have sequentially improved adjusted operating margin each quarter of this year as we remain focused on improving gross margins and reducing G&amp;A expense.
In the third quarter we increased marketing investment in our Nutrition business to support recovery from the supplier recall while we reduced G&amp;A expenses in other areas.
As I mentioned earlier this morning we announced the 57% increase in Abbott's quarterly dividend as we have indicated since early in the year.
Over the course of our first year post-separation we’ve continued to assess capital allocation for the company.
We have now completed that assessment and this announcement reflects Abbott's commitment to providing immediate and significant returns to shareholders in the form of dividend.
A strong and increasing dividend has always been important to Abbott.
We are recognized as an S&amp;P dividend aristocrat having consistently increased the dividend for each of the last 41 years.
We have built the company to continue to deliver sustainable earnings growth and our investment identity continues to be one of growth with now an increased commitment of returning cash to shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss third quarter results in more detail.
Tom? Thanks Miles.
Before I go through our results for the quarter I would like to summarize at a high level the major changes from the expectations we had when we provided guidance back in July.
As Miles indicated in his remarks the disruption in our International Nutrition business that occurred in the third quarter had a meaningful impact on that business in the quarter.
As a result of this event sales in our International Nutrition business were around $90 million lower than our previous expectations.
In addition we decided to make additional marketing investments in the quarter to accelerate recovery.
Combination of lower sales and higher spending related to this event negatively impacted our ongoing earnings per share by around $0.05.
This was offset in the quarter by better than expected gross margin performance reductions in G&amp;A expenses and a lower tax rate.
This resulted in ongoing EPS of $0.55 which represents a 31% growth over 2012 and exceeded the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.03 per share.
Turning to the details for the third quarter sales increased 4.3% on an operational basis.
That is excluding an unfavorable 2.3% impact from foreign exchange.
The sales disruption in our International Nutrition business is estimated to have reduced Abbott's worldwide sales growth by nearly 2% the sales would have increased around 6% without this event.
Emerging market sales were up more than 8% in the quarter on an operational basis and it would have increased more than 12% on an operational basis without the disruption.
Sales growth was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses including operational sales growth of more than 10% in Diagnostics and nearly 12% in Medical Optics along with an improvement in total company sales growth in developed markets.
Reported sales which include the impact of exchange increased 2% in the quarter.
The third quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales ahead of our previous guidance and up 70 basis points over the prior year despite the impact of exchange reflecting strong underlying performance.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted the gross margin ratio by almost 150 basis points in the quarter somewhat lower than our previous expectations.
In the quarter ongoing R&amp;D investment was approximately 6.5% of sales in line with previous expectations.
Ongoing SG&amp;A expense was also in line with previous expectations reflecting additional marketing investments in our International Nutrition business offset by G&amp;A expense reductions.
Overall our adjusted operating margin ratio improved 210 basis points in the quarter over the prior year.
Our year-to-date ongoing tax rate through the third quarter was 19% lower than the forecast we provided on the second quarter call.
This 19% rate also reflects our expectations for the full year 2013.
The revision to this lower tax rate for the full year resulted in a tax rate of 15.7% for the third quarter.
Turning to the outlook for the full year 2013.
Today we are confirming our ongoing full-year earnings per share guidance range of $1.98 to $2.04 reflecting double-digit growth.
We are forecasting operational sales growth that is excluding the impact foreign exchange in the low-to-mid single digits for the full year 2013.
Based on current exchange rates we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2% on full-year reported sales.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low-single digits.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 55.5% of sales ongoing R&amp;D at around 6.5% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A expense of somewhat more than 30% of sales.
We also forecast the full-year net interest expense of approximately $100 million non-operating income of around $50 million and around $40 million of expense on the exchange gain/loss line of the P&amp;L.
Finally as previously indicated we forecast the full year ongoing tax rate of 19%.
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2013.
Operational sales growth is expected to be in the low-to-mid single digits which includes the impact of the Nutrition disruption.
At current exchange rates we would expect roughly 3% negative impact from exchange.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio in the fourth quarter of approximately 55.5% of sales.
We also forecast an ongoing tax rate of 19% for the fourth quarter in line with the year-to-date rate.
Lastly similar to the third quarter we expect the recent sales disruption in our International Nutrition business to impact our ongoing earnings per share by approximately $0.05 in the fourth quarter which is factored into our forecast.
With that I will turn it over to Brian for the operating highlights and growth outlooks by business.
Thanks Tom.
This morning I will provide an overview of third quarter performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter.
My comments will focus on operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
I will first discuss Nutrition where global sales increased more than 3% in the third quarter.
The sales disruption in International Nutrition is estimated to have reduced global nutritional operational sales growth by approximately $90 million.
Global Pediatric Nutrition sales grew 2.7% in the quarter including International Pediatric sales growth of 3%.
Excluding the sales disruption International Pediatric Nutrition continues to drive strong growth as it launches new product innovations and executes on geographic expansion initiatives.
U.S.
Pediatric sales were up 2%.
Abbott remains the market leader in the non-WIC segment of the U.S.
infant formula market and continues to drive uptake of recent innovation launches including Similac Total Comfort our first switch formula that addresses a broad range of mild-tolerance symptoms.
Global Adult Nutrition sales increased 4.4% operationally in the quarter.
International adult sales grew 7.5% overall and double digits in the emerging markets driven by product innovations in our Ensure product line and execution of market expansion initiatives.
U.S.
Adult Nutrition sales were up 1% negatively impacted by the exit from certain non-core business lines as part of our margin improvement initiative.
Excluding the impact of these exits U.S.
Adult sales would have grown mid-single digits.
As previously discussed we will continue to see the impact of the sales disruption on International Nutrition growth in the fourth quarter and in first half of 2014 as we continue to work towards recovery so for the fourth quarter we expect our Global Nutrition business to grow low-single digits on an operational basis.
Moving onto Diagnostics which delivered another quarter of strong growth with sales increased 10.5%.
Core Laboratory Diagnostics operational sales increased 9% in the third quarter driven by strong growth in the U.S.
and internationally.
International sales grew 7.7% driven by continued strong double-digit growth in emerging markets.
U.S.
sales increased 15% driven mainly by a number of key account wins as large health systems continue to choose Abbott's integrated and flexible solutions to management the testing volumes and to increase operational efficiencies.
We also continue to broaden and differentiate our industry-leading assay menu and expect to launch new tests in the area of diabetes cancer and cardiac care.
Most recently preliminary clinical trial results suggest that Abbott's high sensitive component test on ARCHITECT may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of patients presenting with heart attack symptoms.
In Molecular Diagnostics worldwide sales increased 16% in the third quarter.
International sales growth of 24% was led by continued strong infectious disease growth and geographic expansion in emerging markets including the benefit of tender wins in Brazil Russia and Africa as well as continued growth of companion diagnostics.
In Point of Care Diagnostics worldwide sales increased 17% driven by continued growth in the U.S.
hospital and Physician Office Lab segments as well as strong double-digit growth in emerging markets.
For the fourth quarter we are forecasting our Global Diagnostics business segment to generate high single-digit operational sales growth.
In our Established Pharmaceuticals business sales in the quarter increased modestly.
Sales growth in key emerging markets was 2.3%.
We continue to focus on implementing tailored strategies to accelerate growth in emerging markets that are projected to remain attractive for branded generic pharmaceuticals over the long-term.
In the fourth quarter we continue to expect low single-digit operational sales growth from our established pharmaceuticals business.
Lastly medical devices which includes our vascular diabetes care and vision care businesses.
Sales growth in medical devices increased 4% in the quarter.
In our vascular business worldwide sales increased 2.5%.
Sales growth continued to improve sequentially over the second quarter inline with our expectations.
International sales increased nearly 3% driven by continued momentum in key geographies of our next generation drug-eluting stent XIENCE Xpedition and our bioresorbable vascular scaffold Absorb.
This includes continued share gains in Europe as well as Japan where we launched XIENCE Xpedition in August following the successful launch of the XIENCE PRIME small vessel drug-eluting stent earlier in the year.
MitraClip our first-in-class device for treating mitral regurgitation also contributed to international growth in the quarter.
U.S.
sales increased nearly 2%.
While the drug-eluting stent market declined in the quarter we have continued to gain share over the course of the year with the U.S.
launch of XIENCE Xpedition.
Mid single-digit growth in our global endovascular business also contributed to vascular performance in the quarter.
In August Abbott completed its acquisition of IDEV Technologies which expands our endovascular portfolio by adding the SUPERA stent.
SUPERA is available in Europe and is under review by the U.S.
FDA for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery or the SFA.
This unique technology provides Abbott an opportunity to further penetrate the largest and the fastest growing SFA segment of the global peripheral market.
For the fourth quarter of 2013 we expect our global vascular business to increase in the low-single-digits on an operational basis.
In diabetes care global sales in the third quarter increased 1%.
International sales which comprise 60% of total diabetes sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter driven by continued strong double-digit growth in emerging markets.
As expected U.S.
sales were impacted by the implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program for Medicare patients.
We project fourth quarter diabetes care sales growth to be down low single-digits on an operational basis reflecting the impact of CMS competitive bidding in the U.S.
partially offset by strong growth internationally.
In Vision care we exceeded our previous expectations by delivering nearly 12% growth in the third quarter.
Cataract sales which represent more than 60% of our global vision care sales increased double-digits well outpacing the market.
Strong cataract growth was driven by the uptake of new products including TECNIS OPTIBLUE in Japan and TECNIS Toric in the U.S.
Both products provide Abbott with access to large and growing segments of the cataract market where Abbott wasn't previously competing with Toric lenses representing the fastest growing category in the premium segment.
Strong double-digit growth in key emerging markets also contributed to performance this quarter.
In August Abbot completed its acquisition of OptiMedica which provides Abbott with a state-of-the-art laser system and immediate access to the rapidly developing laser cataract surgery market.
This allows Abbott to have broader reach in the growing cataract market.
For the fourth quarter in our global vision care business we expect another quarter of double-digit operational sales growth driven by a continued strong performance of our cataract business.
In summary while sales and earnings were affected by a disruption in our international nutrition business we delivered strong performance across our businesses and improved operating and gross margins.
Excluding the impact of the supplier recall of nutrition total company's sales growth was balanced across both developed and emerging markets with continued sequential sales growth improvement in developed markets and continued double-digit growth in emerging markets.
We improved gross margin by 70 basis points and expanded operating margin by 210 basis points in the third quarter.
Finally we announced a 57% increase in our quarterly dividend demonstrating our confidence in the long-term growth of the company and our commitment to increasing shareholder returns.
We will now open the call for questions.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions).
Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
First off I thought you did a good job of covering all the issues in the Nutritionals business and the impact of Fonterra.
I think that's pretty straightforward.
Let me start with the dividend because obviously it's a very significant increase.
You have meaningfully changed the profile of Abbott's payout and the ongoing payout ratio for the company.
My question Tom is the mix of the company's cash flows because as everybody knows Abbott of course has been generating 70% of its sales outside the U.S.
Can you talk about the ability to fund the dividend long term given your mix of sales and cash flows as you look out and do you need to repatriate profits in order to sustain that longer term? Thanks.
Yes.
I think we are in really good shape for that Mike.
As you know we have very strong cash flow as a company on a normalized basis this year probably approaching the $4 billion range and we have been in a very good position today to cover our cash needs between the various geographies.
As we go forward I think we are in a good position to do that with this dividend payout and obviously that is part of the plan.
I think over time as the company grows and we fund growth wherever it is debt levels might gradually increase over time but we are in very good shape to fund this dividend increase.
Okay.
When the Board I guess contemplated what the right mix was going forward of dividend and buybacks and acquisitions maybe Miles can give us little insight into how you came up with this payout ratio and what's the thought process on the right mix with the company on capital allocation? Yes.
If I take you back to the fourth quarter last year when we split the companies and we split we aligned cash flows and debt and so forth with dividend payout everything kind of aligned in a proportional way with the cash flow generating capability of the two companies.
You will recall at the time AbbVie announced a disproportionately higher dividend we had a disproportionately lower dividend and payout ratio than we had as a combined company historically.
We thought that was appropriate for a pharma business like AbbVie's and the question we had at that time because we were actually not trying to be dividend neutral between the two companies.
The combined dividend as you will recall went up a little bit not a lot but a little bit and we wanted to kind of stabilize and see what cash flow is going forward because as we looked at the investment identity of remaining or new Abbott it was unclear to us exactly where to kind of put the dividend not only from the strength of our performance but just in general what the peer group and/or investors would expect.
Over the course of the year we got a fair amount of feedback and we had a chance to look at that and we concluded that it was so essential to the overall identity of the company that the combination of growth and income was important to our investment base and that income piece was actually probably a little more important than we had placed it at that time which I acknowledged to investors over the course of the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year.
So in terms of looking at the expectation of it I acknowledged to investors during the year we’d look at look at it.
We’d look at capital allocation.
As Tom already indicated it's not a strain on cash flows or a strain on capital allocation.
We are a healthy cash generator and frankly I think we are going to continue to be a healthy cash generator going forward because we are seeing great progress in the margin initiatives we have both on the gross margin line and on the G&amp;A line and I think there is still lot of opportunity there for us to improve margins and improve cash flows as we grow.
So as we looked at that we said making sure we live to that historic identity of a combination of growth and income was important and we came to the conclusion that at the payout ratio we began the year we were not quite where we needed to be or wanted to be on the income side so we chose to take it to where we believe that was at least relative to a peer group and there were probably several different peer groups investors would compare us to but relative to the peer groups we would be compared to we put ourselves in a position where we think we are pretty competitive if not attractive combination of growth and income and then from a cash flow standpoint it's completely achievable.
With regard to share buybacks or M&amp;A activity or other things longer term or frankly even debt pay down we think that the cash flows just as they have been historically are strong enough to accommodate all of that.
So we made the move and I think rather than tickle our way into it a little bit at a time we just sort of concluded let's just go where we think it needs to be or would like to be and we will just set it there and not do this incremental creep up over time.
Our investors ought to know what our identity is and what our payouts are going to look like.
That's why we just chose to announce it now and get it over with.
Okay and maybe just a follow-up one fundamental question if I can and then I will jump.
If we look at the quarter outside of the whole issue with Nutritionals there are really kind of two things that stood out to me and one was the strength of the Diagnostics business.
I don't think people would have expected your U.S.
core immunoassay business to be up as much as it was.
Then on the downside the EPD business which continues to struggle.
I think people were hoping that as you anniversaried some of the price cuts from last year that that business would start to pick up in the second half and obviously it didn't.
So can you talk about what gets EPD going and is the answer a quarter a year from now two years from now is that maybe that just isn't as good as a business as we hoped does that business remain part of the portfolio? Thanks.
Okay that's an easy one.
It absolutely remains part of the portfolio.
Couple of things.
Earlier in the year I acknowledged I think couple of times on these phone calls that what I saw as the bigger issue in EPD for us was our own execution.
While we had bumped up against some of the volatility of emerging markets from time to time whether it was price pressure or whatever it might be.
The fundamentals underlying that business in those markets over time were strongly in our favor.
So the part that was more in our control that I was not as satisfied with was our own execution.
We have made a number of changes in the last few quarters here on that in terms of the structure of our organization some of the management leading the organization.
Frankly the commercial strategies and a linkage between the breadth of our product lines in the therapeutic categories of products in markets that we are marketing and promoting.
It takes some time for that execution to sink in and show some results.
So I would tell you as much as I was self critical of us early in the year about our own execution I would tell you today what I see coming out of the business is all in line with what I would want to see there.
I like what we are doing.
I think we are doing the right things but I think it's going to take probably several quarters here before we see the impact on the top and bottom line.
So from an anecdotal standpoint what I see is all good.
And I think the team is doing exactly what it ought to be doing on the execution line for every one of its geographies but it's going to take some time to see it roll through.
So I haven't lost any confidence at all.
And I would say it's going to play out here.
Has it been delayed relative to our initial expectations either because of market conditions or our own execution? Yes.
Do I expect it to be further delayed in terms of what the performance would be going forward? No I don't.
I expect it will take a few quarters for us to start to emerge and show up on the top and bottom-line but I haven't lost any confidence at all in the business and its prospects for us going forward.
As an example I would tell you in the early part of the year we also saw depressed performance in our Device businesses and we took a number of actions beginning late last year in those businesses and what we have seen this year is every quarter in particular the Vascular business and the Medical Optics businesses sequentially improving on the top and bottom line and sequentially improving share.
And we track share in these markets geographically as a real measure of whether we are succeeding or not and we have seen great evidence across the board here that we are increasing share in these businesses improving our positions and that the actions take place.
So I am pretty confident that everything in these businesses is headed in the right direction.
It's just going to take us a couple of quarters to see it.
I wouldn't have said that quite as strongly about EPD probably three quarters ago but what I see now I like and I think you are going to see that top in bottom-line coming forward.
Now back on diagnostics.
There is another story that's taken time to play out.
I mean that business keeps getting better every quarter and I don't think anybody expected double-digit sales growth on the top-line and yet its growth keeps improving.
It's margins keep improving.
It's ahead of its own plans and schedule in terms of operating and gross margin improvement.
It's ahead of anything that we have communicated to investors and you on the Street and I think that they have got great pipeline of systems in development all of which are on schedule to sequentially roll out in the next few years.
So I think that sometimes because we got this quarterly orientation as public companies we are impatient about how quickly we want to see the impact and it does take some quarters to see the impact.
Since I have seen it in Diagnostics I have seen it in Vascular I have seen it in Medical Optics I have seen it in Nutrition I have seen it in the performance of our gross margin initiatives I am confident that EPD will be just fine and then it will play out in the commitments that we made to you and forecast that that we think that business will do.
I think it's fortunate and that I think this quarter is a good example that we had so much success with the margin initiatives because had it not been for this supplier recall in Asia we would be spewing profit and sales growth this quarter and I think you would be ridiculing our guidance but the fact is the issue with Fonterra and our Asian markets did set us back and yet we still were able to exceed expectations this quarter.
We think it's prudent to maintain our current guidance for the fourth quarter because I think the recall is going to continue to impact us there for a while.
It was about a $90 million hit this quarter we are currently forecasting it to be about a $100 million in the fourth quarter and yet we are going to maintain our guidance and I think we would have been in a position here to be substantially raising our guidance but for that so the underlying fundamentals in all of these businesses and I think EPD too all look good to me.
You just can't see the visibility of the EPD performance yet but we will.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
Good morning.
Thanks for taking the question.
Let me start with the margin question for Tom.
The gross margin I think I heard you say that there was a 150 basis negative impact from FX in the third quarter Tom.
Could you talk about when that goes away and what the implications are looking forward to 2014 and then I just had one product-related question.
Well we do expect Larry some of that to continue into the fourth quarter probably at somewhat lower level probably closer to 100 basis points since we are currently modeling it.
This is an item that does bounce around depending on the currency volatility.
Obviously you know revenues immediately impact margin and sometimes there is some timing differences on the cost side but this quarter did come in a little heavier than we thought and we overcame it quite nicely but we would expect about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter.
If rates would stabilize hopefully next year will be a better year relative to exchange on the margin and it will be share performance but we will have to see what volatility brings.
Thanks for that.
Then on the product side it would be great to get an update on the progress of ABSORB in Europe and also the next steps for MitraClip in the U.S.
Thanks.
Hi Larry.
This is Brian.
Yes.
With ABSORB we are still continuing to see some sequential improvement there.
We had another nice quarter it started to become a more meaningful portion of the portfolio.
I think we will continue to see further increases from it in the fourth quarter particularly as procedures pick up and more adoption takes place.
Also in Europe just as we come out of the summer months we tend to see procedures pick up so ABSORB is on track with our plans and continuing to make progress.
Go ahead Miles.
Larry let me just insert one comment there before Brian moves on.
We are representing a whole portfolio of our stent products now across the board including ABSORB particularly in Europe.
We are seeing sequential share pick up both versus last year and versus last quarter.
I think that as we forecasted in the past what we have done to bring pricing into a tighter band across the products and allow physicians and hospitals let's say easier substitution of which product they wish to use and we have got ABSORB I think priced in a better place now.
We are seeing a pretty good share pickup.
Actually we are seeing it in Western Europe we are picking up share in Japan although that's with expedition same in the U.S.
so we are seeing good share pickup now across the board in all these markets.
Europe gets the extra benefit of having ABSORB and we are definitely seeing the impact of it there.
And then with respect to MitraClip Larry I mean again a meaningful contributor to our international sales growth.
That is with respect to the U.S.
as we just still remain in conversations with the FDA and we want to see where that lands.
But we know they talked to us about decision by the end of the year and nothing has really changed from acquisition with respect to MitraClip.
It's not factored into our guidance at all at this point Thanks for taking the question Thank you.
Our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the question.
I was hoping if you could come back to the diagnostics business a little bit.
And I think specifically in your prepared remarks you talked about a number of big or a few big contracts wins.
When I was down at AACC over the summer one of the things that seemed to be clear among lab managers with whom I spoke was that a propensity for labs looking to do sort of one-stop shopping or looking to buy across the portfolio where you and Roche consistently sort of came up.
Can you maybe just talk about the dynamics in the lab market both in the U.S.
and outside the U.S.? And whether you are seeing the benefit of scale play out at all? Yes hi David.
This is Brian.
With respect to diagnostics it is one where it is more about the total solution that you bring.
And as I mentioned in my remarks we have had a lot adoption from people who like the flexibility and the scalability and the offering that we bring from end-to-end with respect to our cash with respect to our equipment.
We have had to your point some nice key account wins in the U.S.
with takeaways from multiple competitors in the core lab with respect to our core laboratory business.
Recall we put in place this enterprise approach to selling.
We started with the European markets.
As we moved into the U.S.
markets we are definitely seeing that pay dividends in terms of the approach there in terms of selling the complete solutions that we are talking about.
So in the U.S.
you saw the results in the quarter.
That's largely attributed to these account wins.
There was like five or so major account wins that we had taken which helps to build momentum.
It tends to be sticky over time as well when you are talking about these contracts because they tend to be longer term in nature.
So If you are looking at molecular we have again strong growth there.
Again internationally infected disease has been our strength.
We continue to penetrate there.
We had strong double-digit growth in emerging markets having some key tender wins in some key countries Brazil Russia Africa.
Most of our sales again 60% of molecular outside the U.S.
and that's where we are really growing nicely.
And the U.S.
is more of that durable growth that we continue to expect to see.
And then maybe just a follow up on the overall top line outlook both for this year and also how you think about the business going forward.
There has obviously been an evolution of your thinking throughout the course of 2013.
I think we started mid to high-single-digit growth for the year and then mid to high single digit growth in the back half and now it sort of looks like where you are year-to-date is kind of where you are saying things are going to be for the balance of the year and understandably there have been some new factors like the Fonterra situation that have emerged.
So maybe if you could just talk about the top line growth profile both on a near and longer term basis.
Is 4% the right base line? And then how do you get back to that 5% 6% 7% type level? That's an easy one David.
We are right where we expected to be but for the issue with nutrition in Asia in this quarter.
Had that not happened we would be at 6% on the top line and there is lot of ins and outs there.
I mean I guess first we should probably talk operationally which would be the case.
I mean clearly exchange this year I think for everybody has been a significant issue but in any case exchange comes and goes.
The underlying operating strength of the business has ramped just as we had expected it would.
It hasn't done it in every single business the way we thought it would.
EPD has been slower.
Diagnostics and devices have been faster but what it boils down to is we would be right where in fact we are.
I mean we are where we said we would be on the bottom line where we said we would be on the top line but for the issue with nutrition in Asia.
And I would tell you that our plans haven't changed at all nor have our expectations.
I wouldn't be setting a 4% top-line target I would be doing higher than that and we haven't changed our expectations because we don't see the underlying factors any differently than we have before and we don't our strategies any differently.
We are not changing our investment profile.
We are not changing our geographic profile other than beyond what we have told you.
So for us it's all systems straight ahead and it's so far playing out exactly as we had hoped and expected.
We are getting very good gross margin improvement very good G&amp;A improvement.
We get lot of room to go there our pipelines are evolving very nicely in R&amp;D.
Our execution in EPD is progressing just as I have wanted it to our growth in Nutrition is progressing as we have said and remains strong.
Diagnostics particularly strong the Device business is all improving and Medical Optics dramatically so so I would say it all looks to me very strong.
The one exception and it was a significant exception in this quarter was the Asian issue with Nutrition and that's one we will just recover our way out of and we are not going to change our intentions with China or any of the other countries.
We are not changing anything about our strategies.
It happened it wasn't of our making we are dealing with it and we will continue to deal with it but our prospects and our expectations haven't changed one bit.
Okay.
Then maybe just a last thing I know there has been discussion earlier around use of capital and the decision to raise a dividend.
Maybe you sort of frame up how you are thinking about M&amp;A that the deals that you have been doing as of late is a good reflection of the type of acquisitions we should expect on a go forward basis.
Well I would say a couple of things and I go back to the bigger picture.
The overall intent of the company as we have described now for the better part of the year as great combination of growth and income hasn't changed and we are in emerging markets for a reason for the growth that they represent.
We are broadly spread in those emerging markets so we are not over indexed in one.
We are focused on our margin initiatives et cetera which is going to be an absolutely great improvement over time here to lever the bottom line with that growth.
It's going to generate increasing cash flow so we have the cash to do the things we want to do so I think all the working pieces are progressing as we would wish.
One of the things we saw in the quarter that I think is important for investors to note is that when the company hits adversity like any company you expect your management to navigate that adversity and protect your investment.
Either protect that investment or improve upon it in some fashion.
I think that what we saw here was even in the absence of the pharma business we spun-off.
The company and its management are capable of managing through adversity and protecting the investors' investment in the company and still delivering the expectations on the bottom line and it hasn't knocked us off of our trajectory or intent.
Now to go more specifically to your question about cash allocation or capital allocation on the M&amp;A front it remains an opportunistic world.
I would tell you that there is a lot of things that we have looked at and turn down or decided that they weren't economic to pursue.
I would describe the deal market in terms of attractive opportunities right now is limited and where there are businesses that might be available I think some of that price expectations or value expectations are frankly out of line with reason and we are not poor buyers as you might know and I think also one of the things that's affected that M&amp;A market if you are a dollar-based company and you are looking overseas exchanges definitely affecting the valuations of companies.
I think when exchange is volatile and/or moving as much as it did this year it's prudent to wait.
It's prudent to wait to see values align so in some cases we have looked at lot of things.
We are always vigilant we are always paying attention.
I can't say we are aggressively hunting but we are mindful of opportunities as they might fit our businesses or intentions should we want to add to the business so I would say we are opportunistically ready if it happens.
We are not constrained from a financing standpoint nor would anything we might look affect our capital allocation as it might relate to dividends or share buybacks so we try to maintain a pretty healthy balance for our shareholders over time obviously very steady dividend and share buyback to return cash to our investors on a meaningful basis and if we can enhance the growth prospects of the company with something in M&amp;A that fits what we are doing and fits our businesses or fits our overall governing strategy then we take a good hard look at it but if the value is not there we don't move.
I would say that in the past year here there is only a couple of times when we have found that the value and the strategic intent of the company have lined up in those occasions both with IDEV and OptiMedica we have moved on it.
But other than that I would say we are cautiously surveying and not overly jumpy.
Okay that's very helpful perspective.
Thanks Miles.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from with Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
Thanks good morning guys.
I had a quick question.
A follow up on the gross margin.
You had 55.9% in the third quarter.
So great gross margin and you are calling for about 55% in the fourth quarter.
And I know nutritionals are going to - Glenn actually that's 55.5% I think.
55.5% sorry.
And I know nutritionals are going to weigh a little bit more.
But are there fewer offsets in the fourth quarter? So Tom I am wondering if you can just give us the put and takes? And then as a follow up is 55.5% a good number for the first half of next year given the nutritional issues and then strength thereafter? Thanks.
Glenn we are not in a position to talk about '14 right now.
So as we get through this year and then obviously we will talk about our guidance at the appropriate time.
What Tom really means is we are not going to talk about '14 even if we are able to.
Yes.
It is probably just some mix things between the divisions I mean every division is showing nice progress.
I wouldn't read too much into that slight change in outlook and then hopefully if we continue to execute the way we did in the third quarter maybe we will do a little bit better than that forecast.
So I wouldn't read too much into it and as Miles had indicated and we have said in our remarks many times it's a driving gross margin improvement over time.
It's a major focus of the company.
It has been for a number of year now and as we go into '14 obviously we are going to be pushing to drive that off.
So I think we will be in good shape when we report in the fourth quarter and nothing significant in terms of what that guidance means.
Okay.
Can I just sneak in a quick one then.
Absorb.
I am assuming Absorb is being priced at a premium in Europe.
You talked about certain ranges.
Can you give us a sense of what the premium ranges are in Europe? Thanks.
Glenn we are trying to decide which one of us is going to answer this question.
Let me go ahead and we talked about this before.
It really depends by market.
I mean certain markets are going to demonstrate different premiums versus others just where the baseline is but I think it's really a market-by-market segmentation in terms of how we compete with our portfolio of products.
But its not again as we know to be a workhorse type stent and as Miles mentioned it's part of the portfolio solution along with Xpedition and the other things that we have out there which is contributing to me for share gains but we by market it would be hard to just quote an overall number.
But I don't know.
Miles Tom? Yes I will just say a couple of things.
As Miles talked about on the second quarter call I mean our goal on this pricing is that the price is not a barrier to use and now that's kind of what supports the use of the product as a workhorse stent.
So I would say as we look at it in any one market it's a relatively modest premium and certainly not a barrier to the use of the product.
Is the only barrier right now reimbursement in certain countries? No I just think it's a matter of not all lesions lend themselves to Absorb right now.
And it's a matter of physician training.
Physicians need to become comfortable with it.
Those that have used it quite a bit find that they can apply it to a relatively high percentage of the lesion.
So those are really the two things that the commercial team continues work on in terms of increasing the uptake for the product.
Okay great.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Thank you Thank you.
Our next question come from Rick Wise with Stifel Nicolaus Good morning Miles.
Can you talk a little bit more about how the new EPD management team is settling and you touched on it a little bit? Maybe you used some language like we are taking tailored steps to drive better growth.
Can you give us any more color on new team strategies or focus? Are they focused more on execution or something else? We would be very grateful for any perspective? Thank you.
Yes.
Well first of all let me address the team.
We have brought a number of new people to the company from other places that have been a terrific addition in terms of their knowledge and experience.
The branded generic markets around the world are all a little different country-by-country.
That said they have got a lot in common from a similarity standpoint.
They are not like proprietary pharma.
Among the things that we have found at least in our own management and our own team as we separated the company we have a lot of people in positions that are very experienced with the proprietary pharma businesses but not so experienced with branded generic marketing which is marketing a brand marketing broad product lines marketing broad therapeutic categories where a lot of your attention isn't to a given molecule.
It's to a channel to a pharmacy to a hospital to a consumer in a lot of cases and often so but it's about the breadth of offering the brands and so forth and less about a patentable advantage so the marketing skills and the channel skills commercial skills around that are different.
We have made some changes in our marketing teams at the top we have separated the developed markets from the emerging markets because frankly their business structures and characteristics are quite different.
The channels in the markets are quite different the way the markets behave are different our emerging markets don't reimburse the developed markets do so there is very different points of call and points that drive the business and I would say now we have got our management team much more aligned with the differences of the various markets and we have got our marketing teams better aligned with it.
Frankly then it's a question of tailoring the particular elements of our therapeutic category.
There might be 10 or 12 different therapies in a category like gastrointestinal and we want to make sure we got the right mix for each given market.
It could be different from country to country and that align alignment is taking us a little bit of time but I would say we are in much stronger position now knowing exactly what the mix of products is we want by country by therapeutic category by channel et cetera and all of the working in concert is just taking time.
In terms of the margins again you clearly indicate you are seeing continued improvements in Diagnostics and Nutritional margin.
I think am I understanding correctly that you are ahead of plan in Diagnostics and when I think maybe Tom when you talk about the 20% margin goal for Diagnostics and Nutrition by 2015 is that now looking possibly conservative from a timing and/or magnitude perspective? Maybe you could talk about the ramp up of manufacturing distribution facilities and where we are in all that process Tom? Yes.
I mean the division already had quarters in that range and they are not halting their progress and their activity and I think it's fair.
You characterized it pretty fairly Rick that we certainly think we are going to do better than that and I think if you follow the results over the next couple of quarters you are going to see really good progress relative to that goal so yes it's the situation in Diagnostics.
In Nutrition obviously with the event we are going to get a very temporary setback here until we recover.
We still did expand the margin in the quarter but a little bit short obviously of what we were targeting before the event because we need to invest to recover so we get a little bit of a bump in the road there but I think within the matter of few months we will be rapidly back and continue to target that same high level of improvement in Nutrition that we have been talking about for some time so Diagnostics I would say ahead as you characterized it properly and Nutrition we should be right back on track in relatively short order.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
Good morning.
Tom or for Miles just a quick question on this particular recall in the Dynamics.
In other - larger recalls you have seen and this is different and that it's not an Abbott quality issue and the severity of the impact is actually a little bit less but you are actually assuming the recovery period is going to be quite similar so can you help us understand the dynamics and whether this guidance kind as it heads into early next year reflects any conservatives and I wonder just given the dynamics of this recall with other larger players in China it does actually presents a long-term share opportunity of the company.
Well I would say this.
I wish I had a crystal ball that would tell us that exactly because our experience in the past.
We have had experiences in the past with whether it's been a recall or some other event that's impacted share but what happens in the market is mothers in China are acutely aware and acutely informed and same with Vietnam same with frankly I suppose any market in the world.
Mothers are acutely aware of what they feed their babies and they follow infant formula and so forth closely and with social media and other things.
They are just an often informed consumer base.
So when something happens that creates any kind of concern whether it is rumor or otherwise around infant formula it impact mother's confidence in the product or the brand.
And in this particular case the fear that was created was around botulism and as it turned out not to be valid and not to be true.
It didn't turn out that there was a result that way till weeks later.
We can take exception to why it took weeks and so forth and we have had those conversations but in the meantime the mother switches to another brand.
When she switches to another brand she doesn't have a lot of incentive to switch back real fast.
It is like a lot of things.
The media around the negative meaning that the fear of contamination of some sort is far greater and more intense than the media around gee it was a mistake.
So consequently we and other companies that were affected by this find it more difficult to switch the mothers back than it is for them to have switched themselves in the first place.
So we try to model what the behavior of the consumer is going to be and how we might affect that behavior to get her back but it's frankly just more difficult.
So we model it and the end result is the same whether it was quality issue from our company or quality issue from another company or simply a rumor that wasn't the quality issue at all.
At the end of the day if the mother is in any way lacking in confidence about a brand or a product she switches to something else and it take some time to get her back.
So we have invested considerably in a number of things in marketing to rebuild consumer confidence in us our product our brand and to attempt to switch mothers back to us who were our consumers in the first place.
You follow that model and what eventually happens is the baby moves off of infant formula to baby food and other things and you are starting with a new set of moms coming along who are at a stage where they are going to feed their infant formula and in effect you end up replacing the consumer who was affected by the adversity with new consumers and it's about rebuilding and the brand and the brand confidence.
So it takes time.
It's not an instantaneous recovery.
And the damage tends to last a while as you cycle out the consumer who has switched away and new consumers cycle in.
And that's what keeps the pace of recovery more measured than we otherwise might like it.
The more immediate recovery depends on our ability to get that mother back.
That depends very heavily on our customer relation management systems and so forth.
So we know who that consumer is so we can reach her through social media and other mechanisms.
Unfortunately we have had this experience a few times.
So we are getting better and better at it.
I don't know that we are at a point where we can very reliably forecast what that recovery looks like.
I would tell you that in the first week here after the event became known to the public the initial drop off was significant and then there was a steady ramp of recovery.
There was a major week long holiday in China and consumers loaded up prior to the holiday because stores would be closed.
That created a blip.
Then of course it drops off during the holiday.
So you have got a bump in the recovery rates.
So you look at the trends of the sales and it's choppy because of buying patterns affected by holidays and other things.
I would say the underlying trend in performance is encouraging but it's still going to be at a measured pace and I think we are going to need some weeks if not a couple of months here of experience to see how our recovery is going because frankly in some markets we can only measure data monthly.
Otherwise it's anecdotal.
In China we can measure data weekly but its only segments of the market so we are getting partial data and a lot of anecdotal evidence about what the magnitude of loss was and what the recapture rate or recovery rate is.
I would say we have seen some encouraging things but we need more data and time here to trend it out so it is hard to forecast it out very far.
Okay Miles.
Very helpful.
Maybe just a follow-up question.
If I think about your statements about this Nutritional business in the beginning of the year obviously during the year we have had this recall issue that's well understood we have also had statements by the NDRC in China as well.
If you think about structurally your Nutritional business over the next several years do you still feel as confident in your ability to take share in China and as confident in your ability to drive margins higher? Thank you.
Well let me deal with the last first.
I am not like in any confidence at all about the margins.
I think that first of all it's a very good business and it's a very good business in China and other markets as well so I am not concerned about that.
The issue that occurred this summer for all manufacturers around pricing I would say small bump in the road dealt with but the bigger issue here was this recall.
Now has that changed our prospects or anything in the way we view China? China is a choppy market sometimes.
I think it's big it's very attractive.
It's clear.
The Chinese government has its own policies about Chinese companies and what it would like to see as.
It's the evolution of its own economy and its own companies and I think you see that across a lot of businesses a lot of different industries and so forth.
Not just in for Nutrition or Medical Products and so forth.
That said China is an attractive market and it's attractive for us from a growth standpoint and from a share standpoint.
It's a very very competitive market.
It's competitive among multi-nationals and it's competitive with Chinese-based companies or China-based companies with whom we compete so I would say it's an intensely competitive market share can move share can change.
It tends to change the most when there is some adverse event otherwise you are in a battle everyday for share much as we would be in any consumer-like market around the world.
Our prospects and our expectations of China haven't changed.
Our investment profile hasn't changed.
We have built a large plant in China we intend to build more and we will build more.
I suppose it's rather convenient but we have been looking at our entire global sourcing and supply chain with regard to our Nutrition business and owing to what we believe are the growth prospects globally China is part of that.
This doesn't change it.
In fact if anything it's pretty convenient timing that we are considering our total global sourcing strategy at this time and I would say if anything that helps us focus on what the answers to that might be so while China will from time-to-time as any emerging market maybe from time-to-time be choppy I would say collectively the emerging markets overall are pretty attractive opportunity.
As we have said before you have got to be in more than few of them so that you can balance and mitigate the adversity in any one of them at any given point in time.
I can't recall a year when we didn't have some developing market have a problem whether it was a devaluation or supply problem or something.
Foreign exchange issue whatever the case maybe there has always been a problem somewhere and there has been over performance somewhere else.
I think collectively the emerging markets represent an awful lot of growth and an awful lot of development.
To the extent that you can balance a portfolio of businesses and geographies across them there is a tremendous growth opportunity there for companies to participate in.
If you over index in any give place like at China then your trip is going to be a little rockier.
In our case China is big opportunity but all of our businesses have somewhere between 8 and 14 markets that they have targeted as primary growth opportunities to balance that potential choppiness from time-to-time.
Unfortunately the investor will read the media about given one of them and I think that looks volatile to investors and if you are only in that country it might be but we are pretty well diversified across them.
This is a really good example.
This was a fairly significant hit but we have been able to absorb it.
I wouldn't want to have to absorb this very often but the point is with the diversity we have in product line geographies et cetera we were able to absorb this navigate it and keep right ongoing.
So I would say that's a plus.
If you are going to participate in these kinds of growth markets and access the growth that's there then you have got to have enough breadth to manage that volatility from time-to-time and we do.
Okay thank you very much Thank you.
Our next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
Hi thanks for taking my question.
So just firstly on nutrition.
What kind of confidence do you have in some of those outer year revenue guidance ranges that you talked about in the $9 billion to $10 billion range for 2015.
Does the recent impact of the recall in China impact that aspiration at all? Secondly do you think there could be any positive structural tax benefits for you going in to 2014? Which is the closer rate to think about is it more like 21% more like 19%.? Then just on the buyback.
You made some helpful commentary but could you just be a bit clearer.
Would your intention to be to actually reduce the net share count for the company or just a more or less offset employee stock options? Then just lastly.
Consensus margins call for flat margins basically between 2014 to 2016.
Obviously that's calling for maturation of the margins and a topping out of the underlying efficiency gains.
Would you be disappointed with flat margins the EBIT level between 2014 and 2016? Do you think you can do better? Thank you.
Well you got all that done in one breath.
Let me see if I can run back through all that.
Margins for starters.
I haven't looked at what the consensus is across the analyst community.
But I would tell you that it depends an awful lot on what happens with exchange for starters and what happens in general in the economies of the world.
So I would say as a company we expect to improve our margins and I have great confidence in that.
That said actions taken from time to time either by governments on pricing or exchange or other things do affect margins one way or the other and that is less predictable for us of course but had we not had the progress we have had in our own operational margin improvements and G&amp;A margin improvements we wouldn't have been able to absorb those for our investors and we have and still improved margin in spite of that.
So I would tell you that as a baseline in terms of margin improvement I would expect us to continue to improve margin.
What I can't predict for you is the external factors that might impact it.
Tax rate.
In 2014 Tom? Just like all of the guidance type questions we will cover that at the appropriate time in the future.
Obviously as I indicated in my remarks we expect this rate to continue through the fourth quarter and to be our rate for the full year '13 and we will see how it trends as we go into 2014? You better to be clear which rate you are talking about.
This quarter's rate is not a fourth quarter rate.
Right.
The 19% rate that we have in the year-to-date third quarter and the 19% we predict for the fourth quarter 19% for the full year is how we are going to finish '13 we believe and we will see how we trend into '14 as we finalize all our planning activities on '14.
Yes we are careful Jeff not to give guidance in pieces.
I know that a lot of you want a build models for 2014 but we don't talk in terms of payout ratio and dividends we don't talk about some of these elements because everybody will be backing into some earnings estimate for next year which we are not prepared to talk about yet.
I want to see how some of this trending is going to come in the fourth quarter.
Our goal is always double-digit.
So that part is fairly straight forward.
You could start there every year but how the elements will come together is still to be seen.
Now I have got to back up and remember the other early parts of your question.
Growth in the nutrition over the long-term here.
The goals in terms of revenue growth in nutrition haven't changed.
What I can tell you is what the recall in Southeast Asia will do at least in the near term.
I think I know what's it going to do and I think I know how we are going to recover from it and I think I can project that to some degree but frankly it was a setback.
So it has probably cost us some time but I wouldn't say it is going to cost us longer term.
The revenue we aspire to or the share we aspire to et cetera it's a just a question of time and the pace at which we can recover it so I think there is kind of a finite magnitude of its impact on us and we then grow beyond it.
I would say our revenue aspirations haven't changed whether we got the timing just right or not unclear.
What I want to be careful about doing is giving you a specific number for 2015 because I don't know what that number ought to be exactly so full transitory that way but in terms of general growth rate here and general trending I would say our aspirations for the Nutrition business haven't changed.
Then finally you asked about buybacks.
Tom? Yes.
I mean we have continued to be a company that buys back shares most years virtually every year.
We have been pretty active this year continuing to buyback probably in the $1.
5 billion range.
Question was specifically though around what we were just trying to offsets options and stock comps versus share count and frankly at a minimum we do.
The employee grants and so forth and generally share count has gone down.
Right.
Obviously the baseline would be the dilution impacts so we have been pretty opportunistic to increase beyond that.
Like the other questions we will see how we do in 2014 but have a substantial authorization in place I think over 2.6 billion remaining on that authorization so we have plenty of room to continue to buy back shares as we see appropriate.
We don't like share count to go up actually we like it to go down.
We have got one more call in the queue please? One more question? Yes.
Okay.
Our final question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
Thanks for taking the question.
Miles I was just wondering if you could give us an update on your thinking within kind of the medical product side specifically within devices.
A lot of companies within the space have been talking more and more about the increased importance of being really deep and broad across product line so I am just wondering how you are feeling with the Vascular business and to what extent going forward do you think you need to be more broadly in cardiovascular to really be successful there.
Then also kind of your thoughts on how to position the Diabetes business whether that might be another opportunity for you to expand as well? Okay.
First let me take the Cardiovascular Device business.
We have a desire to be broader I suppose like everybody else does.
I think the timing in the categories you are broader in depends on your strategy and it depends on how you want to get there so I would say our acquisition of IDEV was in a category where we wanted to be broader.
No question about it.
That was an attractive opportunity for us.
We always have a pipeline of opportunities that we are tracking some of which we have equity investments in and participate either passively or indirectly in and others more directly so I think it's kind of question of when those opportunities ripen and when the right time is to bring them into the portfolio if we do that.
I would say we are always looking to broaden the device businesses and we are always looking for innovation beyond our own.
That said I think it depends on the timing.
There's a lot times in the Device business that companies will go out and invest in a lot of things early and it will take four five six years for something to develop.
We have made equity investments early but we tend to wait until we can see the whites of its eyes before we are ready to move more substantially on an investment.
We can tell it's coming to commercial fruition so I would say we definitely continue to have aspirations for breadth that way.
That would be true of our Medical Optics business as well.
Turning to Diabetes Care lot of change going on in that market right now and I would say that in particular in the U.S.
with the competitive bidding and so forth.
If you track the few competitors in this space and their responses to that and compare our various performances you will see that there has definitely been an impact on the Diabetes Care business dramatically for some relative to others less impactful on us.
Our strategy has been different there than some of our competitors.
And I think we have held share and revenues very well.
Longer term.
The strategy at least for us is a focus on very innovative family of products coming in our R&amp;D pipeline that we have alluded to in the past and are beginning to emerge now I think are beginning to get some visibility now in terms of continuous testing and so forth that I think will be game changing and very well received by the market.
That's very different than the base core business today.
But we have actually great expectations and aspirations about that.
And we think we are in a position here that others are not in at least in this particular category.
So we have got great hopes for what our R&amp;D people are coming with.
As I said it's beginning to show and as the next 12 months or so progress you will start to see more of that.
With the continuous testing is that just expanding or I guess some sort of Navigator iteration? Well I would say it captures some of the intent of Navigator but in a very different way.
So I think it's meant to address the frequent tester the insulin dependent tester and the person who clearly wants easy but a frequent continuous monitoring instantaneously and in a different way somewhat different way than Navigator but it's clearly met to address those who were Navigator users and others and frankly on top of that.
Just last question I guess.
Would you also be looking to expand beyond the existing kind of businesses that you are in within devices or just deepening across more adjacencies? Well you know I just never kind of forecast that.
It's always possible because we look for businesses that have characteristics or criteria that are consistent with the characteristics in our portfolio and it depends to some degree on whether those businesses have an advantage being part of Abbott or we can do better with it than what we see it doing standalone or as part of somebody else.
So I would say first priority is always related strategic fit with our existing businesses but in some cases it might be a new category.
Although today I could tell you I am not focused on something that's not part of Abbott now.
Okay.
Thanks very much.
Okay thank you.
All right.
Thank you Lisa.

In today’s conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott’s ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which exclude the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Okay thanks Brian.
Good morning.
This morning I will review our 2013 results as well as our outlook for 2014.
For the full year 2013 we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.01 representing double-digit growth over 2012.
At the same time we returned nearly $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and announced a substantial increase in our dividend beginning this year.
Strong performance across many of our businesses and operating margin expansion enabled us to deliver on our 2013 expectations despite a few challenges.
Similar to other multinationals we were impacted by a slowdown in several emerging economies as well as by foreign currency.
Abbott was also impacted by a supplier recall in the International Nutrition.
As I have discussed on our previous earnings calls we were able to offset these impacts in 2013 in part through selective cost management.
At the same time we executed on our key priorities.
We achieved high single-digit sales growth in Diagnostics vision care and Nutrition excluding the impact of the supplier recall as well as sequential improvements in our vascular business each quarter of last year.
We increased total company emerging market sales by 11%.
This was driven by double-digit growth in our Diagnostics Medical Devices and Nutrition businesses.
We completed two acquisitions in medical devices that brought us important best in class technologies to expand our presence in our endovascular and Vision Care businesses.
We launched numerous new products including our MitraClip Structural Heart device in the U.S.
Muliple innovations in our cataract lens business.
They are driving share gains and nearly 70 product launches in nutrition and we expanded our margin significantly in nutrition and diagnostics.
As we move into 2014 we will continue to appropriately invest in our businesses to execute on our strategic priorities to drive long term growth.
Our ongoing earnings per share of $2.16 to $2.26 calls for double digit growth at the mid-point.
However in the first half of the year we will see some carry over effects from foreign exchange and the nutrition supplier recall where we’re making good progress to recover our share.
The long term fundamentals of our business are strong and we remain committed to increasing returns to shareholders.
In addition to our dividend increase we’re projecting an increase in share repurchase activity.
Overall we expect to return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2014 which Tom will discuss in a few minutes.
Moving on to our 2013 results and outlook for the business in 2014.
In nutrition as expected fourth quarter sales growth increased low single digits affected by the supplier recall that was initiated in August.
The additional marketing investments we made in the third and fourth quarters are supporting our recovery and we’re on track with our expectations to recapture our share in the effected geographies.
As we look to 2014 we remain optimistic about our growth prospects in nutrition and we’re well positioned to achieve our strategic priorities.
We will further expand global capacity with three new manufacturing facilities that will come online in the U.S.
China and India this year.
Demand is strong for both adult and pedantic nutrition.
We will continue to see productivity from our R&amp;D organization and expect to launch several important innovations in 2014 that will help us gain share and in adult nutrition continue to shape and grow that market.
With the combined launch of new products we expect to return to high single digit operational sales growth in nutrition this year as we lap the impact from the supplier recall in the second half of 2014.
This will continue to be driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets which we expect to comprise nearly half of nutrition’s total sales by the end of this year.
And finally margin improvement which remains a key priority for this business.
We expanded operating margin in our nutrition business by nearly 300 basis points in 2013 ending the year at 18.7% of sales.
We expect meaningful margin expansion again this year and the business is well on track to reach it's 2015 operating margin target of more than 20% of sales.
In established pharmaceuticals fully year sales increased modestly.
As we have discussed macroeconomic and market pressures in certain emerging markets impacted EPD more significantly than we had anticipated at the start of last year.
At the same time new commercial leadership is working to improve how we execute our branded generic strategy in both emerging markets and developed countries.
As I’ve said this will take time and we will be looking for improved momentum in this business heading into next year.
Over the next several years we expect continued improvement in EPDs growth as sales in emerging markets become a larger component of this business.
Growth rates in emerging markets have been and are expected to continue to be higher from the growth rates of the developed countries and the overall global economy and established pharmaceuticals remains well aligned with the fundamentals driving long term growth for health care and emerging markets.
In our Medical Device business which includes our vascular diabetes care and vision care businesses sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter.
In vascular in 2014 we expect continued improvement over full year 2013 driven by growth in emerging markets and the launch of multiple new products to expand our leading share positions.
This includes the U.S.
launch of MitraClip our first in class product for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation which is the most common heart valve condition in the world.
Combined with continued growth outside the U.S.
we expect strong double digit growth of MitraClip sales in 2014.
And we have the expected launch of the new peripheral stents in our endovascular portfolio and we will continue to expand share with our leading drug eluting product portfolio.
We launched the XIENCE Xpedition in August in Japan and we will launch it in China this month.
We will also continue to expand share of our bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB outside of the U.S.
at the same time we move it through the development process in several key geographies including the U.S.
Japan and China.
In Vision Care sales increased 15% in the quarter driven by accelerating growth in our cataract lens business.
This business now represents more than 65% of our vision care sales and has been growing well in excess of market growth rates.
We expect double-digit sales growth for this business in 2014 with continued positive momentum from new products.
And this includes our TECNIS Toric lens in the U.S.
our TECNIS OptiBlue lens in Japan and our new Catalys laser cataract system as well as new product launches we expect early this year.
Diagnostics remains one of our most durable growth businesses consistently delivering mid to high single-digit operational sales growth for the past three years.
Full year 2013 sales growth of 8% was balanced geographically with double-digit growth in emerging markets and mid-single-digit growth in developed markets.
Margin expansion once again exceeded expectations for the full year increasing 300 basis points versus 2012.
In 2014 we expect strong performance in Diagnostics as we continue to build momentum in core laboratory diagnostics increased the penetration of our molecular and point-of-care businesses and expand our presence in emerging markets across all three diagnostics businesses.
In our R&amp;D pipeline we will continue to invest in the development of several new instrument platforms across the diagnostics portfolio that we expect to launch over the next several years.
These new systems add new features that are important to our customers such as speed scalability productivity and shorter turnaround time.
So in summary as we look to 2014 we again expect double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth.
We are on track with our recovery efforts in Nutrition.
We are projecting an increase in share repurchases in 2014 following a 57% increase in our dividend announced last October.
And as we move into the second half of this year we expect stronger sales in earnings growth highlighted by a reacceleration in our Nutrition business continued durable performance in Diagnostics strong vision care growth and another year of double-digit sales growth in emerging markets.
I will now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss 2013 results and the 2014 outlook in more detail.
Tom?  Thanks Miles.
Today we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $0.58 in line with our previous guidance range and up more than 20% over the prior year.
Sales for the quarter increased 3.3% on an operational basis that is excluding an unfavorable impact of nearly 3% from foreign exchange.
As anticipated fourth quarter sales growth was affected by the supplier recall in our International Nutrition business which reduced operational sales growth by an estimated 1.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by high single-digit growth in Diagnostics and double-digit growth in vision care.
Sales in emerging markets were up at 9% in the quarter on an operational basis.
Reported sales which include the impact of exchange were up slightly in the quarter.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% in line with expectations and up 60 basis points versus the prior year despite a negative impact from exchange of 60 basis points.
Ongoing SG&amp;A expense was 28.5% of sales lower than expectations reflecting in part G&amp;A expense reductions.
Finally our adjusted gross margin ratio improved by 160 basis points over the prior year in the quarter.
Overall as we look at 2013 we delivered strong ongoing earnings per share growth in line with our initial guidance and up double-digits despite some challenges.
We also achieved a number of financial objectives we set out a year ago.
Our Diagnostics business expanded its operating margin by 300 basis points and continued to deliver strong top line growth.
Our Nutrition business expanded its operating margin by nearly 300 basis points.
And overall we expanded adjusted gross operating – adjusted operating margin by more than 100 basis points.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014 today we issued full year ongoing earnings per share guidance of $2.16 to $2.26 reflecting double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range.
Before I review our forecasts for sales and P&amp;L line items I would like to discuss certain factors that are impacting our forecast for 2014 and comparisons for 2013.
We achieved our ongoing EPS expectation in 2013 in the face of a negative foreign exchange impacts on sales of approximately 2%.
Additionally the supplier recall in our International Nutrition business impacted EPS by an estimated $0.10 per share in the second half of the year.
The effects of these two items on growth would carry into the first half of 2014.
In terms of exchange the yen began a steady decline in the first quarter of 2014 and a number of emerging market currencies similarly weakened beginning late in the second quarter.
Both of these events are expected to affect reported results in the first half of 2014 but if current rates were to hold exchange impacts would normalize by the second of 2014.
Over the past 12 months we have been assessing how to better align our resources and infrastructure to meet the needs of our business owing to the separation from AbbVie.
As I mentioned previously we took some selected G&amp;A expenses out in 2013 and reduced our ongoing SG&amp;A expense ratio from 31.3% of sales in 2012 to 30.6% in 2013.
In 2014 as part of our efforts to get our support structure to appropriately levels we will take further actions to reduce our expenses.
We expect SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of sales to decline by around 70 basis points in 2014.
We continue to update you on these initiatives as appropriate.
We project share repurchases in 2014 to exceed $2 billion above the 2013 level.
Combined with the 57% increase from the dividend announced last October we plan to again return substantial cash to shareholders in 2014.
In 2014 we intend on a onetime basis to repatriate about $2 billion in 2014 earnings generated outside the United States.
We expect that the cash taxes due in the U.S.
on this one time repatriation will be low as we plan to accelerate utilization of various long term deferred tax assets.
This repatriation would result in specified charges to tax and be around $0.40 per share in 2014 of which $0.30 will be non-cash with $0.10 in cash taxes.
Turning to our 2014 outlook we’re forecasting operational sales growth in the mid-single digits to the full year 2014.
Based on current exchange rates we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 1% on our full year reported sales that the most significant impact in the first half of the year.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits to the full year 2014.
Operational sales growth is expected to be driven by continued strong growth in diagnostics nutrition and vision care along with an improvement in the growth rate in vascular.
We’re also forecasting continued strong growth across our businesses in emerging markets.
We expect a high single digit operational sales decline in our diabetes care business driven by reimbursement reductions and competitive dynamics in the U.S.
Brian will go into more detail on the 2014 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We forecast on adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% for the full year 2014 which reflect a negative impact of around 90 basis points and the combination of foreign exchange and the effect of the U.S.
market conditions and our U.S.
Diabetes Care business partially offset by underlying improvements in nutrition diagnostics and Vision Care.
We forecast ongoing R&amp;D somewhat about 6% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A of approximately 30% of sales for the full year 2014.
Overall we expect to expand our full year adjusted operating margin by approximately 60 basis points in 2014.
Forecast net interest expense of around $90 million non-operating income around $10 million.
Approximately $50 million of expense on the exchange gain/loss line of the P&amp;L and ongoing tax rate of 19% for the full year of 2014.
Finally I would like to review the quarterly outlook for 2014.
For the first quarter we’re forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.36.
As I discussed earlier certain amount of lease will effect sales and earnings comparisons in the first and second quarters of 2014 including the carry over effects of 2013 foreign exchange movements and the 2013 supplier recall on nutrition.
We forecast modest operational sales growth in the first quarter and a current exchange rate we would expect a negative impact from exchange of approximately 3% resulting in reported sales down low single digits.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 54% which reflect impact in foreign exchange.
The 2013 supplier recall in nutrition and competitive dynamics and diabetes care.
We also forecast ongoing SG&amp;A expense around 33.5% of sales and R&amp;D expense approaching 7% of sales in the first quarter.
For the second quarter we are forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.51.
We forecast operational sales growth in the low to mid-single-digits in the second quarter.
And at current exchange rates we would expect a negative impact on foreign exchange of approximately 1.5 percentage points.
For the first and second quarter we project specified items at $0.27 and $0.22 especially reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release.
As previously indicated we expect the pace of both sales and ongoing EPS growth to accelerate in the second half as comparisons become more favorable with operational sales growth in the mid to upper single-digits and steady operating margin expansion.
So in summary we delivered double-digit EPS growth in 2013 and our 2014 outlook reflects double-digit earnings growth at the midpoint of our guidance range driven by improving sales growth in a number of our businesses and expanding operating margin.
And with that I will turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights.
Thanks Tom.
This morning I will provide a more detailed review of our fourth quarter performance and our 2014 sales outlook.
As mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I will first discuss our Nutrition business where global sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter and were impacted as expected by the supplier recall in International Nutrition.
The sales disruption is estimated to have reduced global nutritional operational sales growth by approximately $90 million or somewhat more than 5% in the quarter.
Global Pediatric Nutrition sales were down 2% in the quarter including a 3% decline in International Pediatric Nutrition.
Excluding the impact of the sales disruption International Pediatric Nutrition sales would have increased strong double-digits driven by market uptake of new product innovations.
While the U.S.
Pediatric sales were relatively flat in the quarter Abbott remains the market leader in the non-WIC segment of the U.S.
infant formula market and continues to drive uptake of recent innovation launches.
Global Adult Nutrition sales increased 5% in the quarter with international adult sales increasing 14% driven by strong growth of our Ensure and Glucerna brands along with execution of several market development initiatives.
U.S.
Adult Nutrition sales were down 5% impacted by the exit from certain non-core business lines as part of our margin improvement initiative as well as higher sales in 2012 from the timing of a new product launch.
We continue to focus on innovation in our global nutrition business.
In 2014 we anticipate several important programs to drive share gains in Pediatric Nutrition and category expansion in Adult Nutrition where Abbott holds the global leadership position.
This includes the recent launch of Similac’s Triple [ph] Pack in the online market segment in China which brings Abbott’s best-in-class packaging solution to this large and rapidly growing segment of the infant formula market.
At the same time we continued to expand our manufacturing and R&amp;D presence to be closer to our customers.
As Miles mentioned three new manufacturing facilities will come online this year including plants in China and India.
In addition we are investing in local R&amp;D and recently opened a R&amp;D center in China and broke ground on a new pilot plant in Singapore.
As a result of these efforts we expect our R&amp;D resources based in emerging markets to grow more than 30% over the next few years.
For the full year 2014 we are forecasting high single-digit sales growth on an operational basis for our Global Nutrition business.
We are on track with our recovery efforts in the geographies affected by the supplier recall and forecast low double-digit operational sales growth in the International Nutrition.
As Tom mentioned we will see a first half carryover effect of the supplier recall.
And for the first quarter we are forecasting a low single-digit sales decline on an operational basis for our Global Nutrition business.
In our Diagnostics business we achieved nearly 9% sales growth in the fourth quarter including mid-teens growth in emerging markets.
Core laboratory diagnostic sales increased more than 9% in the fourth quarter driven by continued above market performance in both developed and emerging markets.
This business continues to execute on its commercial strategy to deliver total solutions that are efficient flexible and cost effective to large healthcare customers.
In Molecular Diagnostics worldwide sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter with international sales up 10% led by strong growth in infectious disease platforms and geographic expansion in emerging markets.
In point of care diagnostics worldwide sales increased 14% driven by continued growth in the U.S.
hospital and physician office lab segments as well as a double digit growth in emerging markets.
In 2014 we expect to again deliver above market performance in global diagnostics.
In core laboratory diagnostics will continue to broaden our ARCHITECT assay menu and execute on our commercial strategies in both developed and emerging markets such as China Brazil and Russia.
We also expect continued double digit growth in our infectious disease business in molecular diagnostics and continue market penetration with our point of care platform with double digit growth in emerging markets across all three businesses.
At the same time we will continue development of several next generation platforms that are designed to positively impact point of [ph] care improve service to customers enhance laboratory productivity and reduce cost.
For the full year 2014 we expect our global diagnostics business to generate mid to high single digit operational sales growth.
With mid-to-high single digit growth in Core Laboratory and molecular diagnostics and double digit growth in point of care diagnostics.
For the first quarter we are forecasting low to mid-single digit operational sales growth in our global diagnostics business.
In our status pharmaceuticals business or EPD sales increased in the quarter modestly.
Sales growth in our key emerging market segment increased 10% in the quarter led by strong growth in Russia China and Brazil.
We continue to focus on broadening our core therapeutic area product portfolios strengthening our commercial capabilities and implementing tailored strategies to accelerate growth in emerging markets.
Sales growth in our developed and other market segment decreased 7% in the quarter and continues to be impacted by market conditions particularly in Western Europe.
As we look ahead to full year 2014 for EPD we expect low single digit operational sales growth as we build momentum over the course of the year.
Given that 100% of EPD sales are outside of the U.S.
this business is relatively more impacted by exchange movements.
But we would expect sales to be relatively flat on a reported basis.
In the first quarter of 2014 we’re forecasting sales to be relatively flat on an operational basis which includes the timing impact from a plant shutdown to expand capacity in order to meet increasing demand for one of our key products in the emerging markets.
Including the impact of foreign exchange we expect first quarter reported sales to be down mid-single digits.
And lastly Medical Devices which includes our vascular diabetes care and Vision Care businesses.
Sales growth in Medical Devices increased 4% in the fourth quarter.
Our vascular business achieved another quarter of sequential improvement in it's growth rates the worldwide sales up nearly 4%.
International sales increased more than 5% driven by continued momentum across key geographies of XIENCE Xpedition and ABSORB.
Double digit sales growth of MitraClip and strong performance of our endovascular portfolio.
The U.S.
sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter.
In 2014 we expect continued sales growth improvement in endovascular business driven by a number of new product launches including MitraClip.
The approval and launch of a new peripheral stent in our endovascular portfolio and a continued growth of ABSORB.
We continue to move ABSORB through the development process in several key geographies.
Most recently we completed an enrollment in our ABSORB trial in Japan and we’re on track to complete enrollment in China and the U.S.
in the first half of this year.
For the full year 2014 we expect sales in our global vascular business to increase in the low to mid-single digits on an operational basis with low to mid-single digit growth in the first quarter.
In Diabetes Care global sales in the fourth quarter decreased 3.5% impacted by implementation of the competitive bidding program for Medicare patients.
International sales which represent 60% of total diabetes care sales increased 4% in the quarter driven by strong performance in the emerging markets.
For the full year 2014 we forecast a high single digit decline in global diabetes care on an operational basis.
In our international diabetes care business we expect similar performance to 2013 driven by continued double digit growth in emerging markets.
This will be offset by an expected decline in the U.S.
impacted by reimbursement reductions and competitive dynamics resulting in a low double-digit operational sales decline for our global diabetes care business in the first half of 2014.
In vision care we achieved nearly 15% sales growth in the fourth quarter with balanced double-digit growth in both emerging and developed markets.
Sales of cataract products increased strong double-digits outpacing the global cataract markets driven by the continued uptake of recently launched products.
These new intraocular lenses or IOLs provide Abbott with access to large and growing segments of the cataract market where we weren’t previously competing.
We expect continued strong growth in our vision care business this year as we continued to introduce new products.
This includes the launch of new preloaded IOLs which improved the ease-of-use for the cataract surgeons as well as the further penetration of our new Catalys laser cataract system which is receiving very positive feedback.
For the full year 2014 we forecast double-digit operational sales growth in our global vision care business with mid to high single-digit growth in the first quarter.
In summary we achieved our expectations for 2013 including double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth a more than 100 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin and numerous new product launches.
In 2014 we are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth with accelerated growth in the second half of the year.
We will now open the call for questions.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.
Good morning.
Can you hear me okay?  Yes.
Okay perfect.
Okay.
Let me start with the combination repatriation and buyback.
Tom it looks like you are if I am reading the press release correctly you are repatriating $2 billion there is going to be with a cash and non-cash costs doing so? And then we are using that to buy back stock which are passing out the impact of repatriating from your earnings and your guidance for 2014? Is that right?  Just a few points I don’t think you can directly link the two items but certainly what this is about Mike is monetizing assets as early as we possibly can and providing strategic flexibility from a financing perspective across the company.
We are in a position here where we have these deferred tax assets that as you know typically get realized over a long period of time in future tax returns.
And this is an opportunity to immediately use them to help monetize and bring back only 2014 earnings.
This has nothing to do with anything in the past and provide that cash here in the U.S.
for strategic flexibility and the various things we would want to use it for.
So since it is one-time in nature it’s going to be done only on 2014 earnings and this is a one-time opportunity to monetize these deferred assets.
That’s why we are handling it as a specified item in 2014.
But you are repatriating $2 billion and you are using $2 billion to buy back stock but you are backing out the – at least the cash impact you would think should go through the income statement?  But again it’s one-time in nature Mike.
Our pattern in the past has been to reinvest our expectation as we go forward beyond 2014 is to reinvest these foreign earnings.
And this is a one-time opportunity where basically the focus is to monetize these assets as early as we possibly can and allow them to be redirected to whatever product of use whether its strategic initiatives share buyback or whatever.
And the other thing I had mentioned is in 2013 we bought back over $1.5 billion in shares though it’s not a – it’s difficult to directly link this planned action with share repurchase.
But I think it’s a matter of just productively using these assets in the best way possible for shareholders overall and we think this is an opportunity we want to capitalize on in 2014.
Okay.
It’s probably we are spending a few minutes on the first quarter guidance because obviously there is a disconnect between the guidance in the industry.
I’m kind of new industry [ph] this thing was aggressive but there is still even a wider disconnect than we were modeling.
So maybe spend a minute on some of the different elements here.
I think we’re aware that if that was the headwind but you talked about couple of other items an issue where you are breaking [ph] a plant down.
Maybe you can just walk through and maybe try and help us bridge (indiscernible) is that and where you’re guys heading for the first part of the year?  Really Mike there are two big things are effects [ph] but obviously the nutrition supplier recall was well I mean you saw the impact on the third and fourth quarters of our 2013 results.
As you know we managed through that quite well and delivered on expectations overall but that factor is tearing into the first half.
As Miles mentioned we’re making good progress recovering we’re right on the path we projected.
But as we said from the very beginning when this occurred this is going to cause a very top first half comparison in 2014 and that’s what you’re seeing.
You know there are at the business level other relatively smaller comparison issues but these really are the two big factors that are causing the first quarter to be tough.
The last thing I would add is while you know exchange is a challenge for us in 2014 and the first half.
The first quarter is particularly impacted in 2014 because as the exchange rates moved in 2013 some of those costs are an inventory as we close out 2013 and float through the P&amp;L in the early part of the year in 2014.
So the exchange impact is particularly acute in the first quarter and I think those two factors really are the main reasons for the forecast being a little bit different than what people are expecting.
Just on the early first quarter top line growth.
It sounded like you were guiding to a constant currency that would be low single digit since you were anticipating a low single digit decline in recorded revenues.
Just help us with from the fourth quarter to the first quarter what gets a little bit more difficult and then I will drop.
Thanks.
It really has to do with trends in the businesses.
Certainly as we talked about the growth rate in International Nutrition is being impacted by Fonterra by the recall.
There are phasing as you know our established pharmaceuticals business is a business that changes from quarter-to-quarter.
In the first quarter there is a plan to expand capacity for one of our key products as a result of that we’re we have to shut down the plant in the quarter and that will draw down some of the sales until we can start the plant up again in the second quarter and get the growth rate going back up in that business.
I would say those are the primary reasons.
There is some timing effects in diagnostics as well but those were the main reasons why the first quarter is in the range that you described.
And our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Tom you gave us some help on the first quarter gross margin number.
I wonder if you could help us sort of into the second quarter on gross margins or just maybe more qualitatively first half versus second half how GMs [ph] likely trend and what are the key headwinds and tailwinds there we should think about obviously FX being one of them.
Yeah I would say there are two things going on in gross margin as we look at 2014 are pretty much what I mentioned in my remarks.
We’re just slightly down year-over-year and that’s really currency again being challenging and the competitive dynamics we talked about in diabetes care.
I think as you look out into the second quarter the pattern or the expectation for the full year could be extrapolated into our expected gross margin progress in the second quarter of the year.
So those are really the two main factors it was not what I mentioned in my remarks and I think it does mask lot of good things happening underneath in the businesses particularly in nutrition and diagnostics but also on Vision Care in terms of expanding the gross margin before some of these exchange in fact hits the businesses.
Okay maybe just two more quick ones.
Just one for Tom and one maybe for Miles but in terms of the buyback you’re very clear on how you’re funding the buyback this year but Tom could you give us a sense of free cash in ’14 and how we should think about funding dividends or buybacks you know either through using debt or patronization going forward.
Yeah I mean as we look at free cash flow capital expenditures and dividends.
And as you know we are stepping up the dividend in 2014.
I would say in the $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion range was something we would expect.
And that leaves a lot of strategic flexibility for whatever might occur or opportunities that might pop up during the year.
So as you know we had some anomalies in our cash flow in 2013 relative to the carryover effect of separation but we should be back into that pretty strong operating cash flow level and strong free cash flow to support the strategic objectives of the business.
Okay.
And then Miles you made some commentary in your remarks about the going after costs and Tom talked about the leverage we are going to see in ‘14 I mean the company since the spin as talked about on a per segment basis achieve very strong margins obviously Nutritionals comes to light but do you see further opportunities for going after corporate costs post the spin and is it likely that those type of initiatives are more ratable or is there a possibility for more decisive action? Thank you.
Well I think the answer – the simple answer to your question is yes it is a focus for us not just related to the spin but in general related to the shape of the business.
A lot of our business is outside the U.S.
and so there is an opportunity to structure ourselves from a support standpoint little differently.
And we definitely were addressing that.
We are putting a fair amount yet.
As you know we put a lot of attention on gross margin above the line there but we are also putting a fair amount of attention on general and administrative costs across the corporation not only at the corporate level but in the divisions in support and overhead costs.
So I do think there is opportunity there.
By its very nature some of it can be more immediate but then some of it is more ratable because in some cases you got to replace old processes with new processes or old systems with newer ones etcetera.
So I think it’s a combination of both David.
Although I like to push hard for sooner rather than later I think this is one of those areas where chronic dissatisfaction or inpatients is a good thing.
And so we push on that.
You are always trying to balance disruption to the organization or to the business versus the ongoing operation but yes there is an opportunity.
We are on it.
We are paying attention to it.
And it is a combination of frankly both immediate and more ratable.
Okay thank you very much.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
Thank you and good morning.
I wanted to touch a couple of business specific dynamics and then one strategic question.
I guess maybe we can start with EPD and Miles I can certainly appreciate your comments that it may take time for a new management team to get in place and affect their impact on the business but maybe you could go into a little bit more specifics about what the path is for that franchise.
So I look at the non-key emerging market segment that has been a business that’s been deteriorating I think each of the past several quarters and it doesn’t – it’s sort of I think a little bit unclear given how this business works what exactly turns this around.
So maybe you could just provide a little bit more color on what steps the new management team is taking and then how we would see those flow through into reported numbers?  Well I think we got two very different stories here.
And as I have said in the past you’ve got very much an emerging market story and a developed market story and then within those some segmentation.
I would tell you that in the emerging markets there are many that are very attractive some that are less so because they may be more commodity oriented than brand oriented.
We tend to be focused on the ones where it’s advantageous for us to be very brand-oriented and the markets are very attractive and profitable.
As much as the growth rates may look modest or lacking the profit profile of this business is quite attractive.
Gross margins in this business are above 60%.
It’s a very well-run business.
It’s a very attractive profitable business.
If it was an unprofitable business it would be a whole different story but this is actually a very attractive business.
And the question is getting the segments right in terms of the attractive markets and those that are less attractive.
So we put our focus on emerging markets that are sizable where we have got critical mass and are attractive.
And our main focus there is two things.
One expanding the breadth of the therapeutic categories and the product lines that we are offering and frankly improving our branding and consumer skills as an adjunct to that business because in any given country how we reach the consumer whether through the physician on hospital or direct to the consumer and so forth does make a difference.
So in the emerging markets I think that’s the focus and it’s getting a lot of attention.
It’s a lot of blocking and tackling and smaller things but frankly it's working.
We saw in the fourth quarter a returned double digit growth in emerging markets for EPD which is what I frankly expect.
We know that some of those markets slowed last year as a function of the markets but the growth rates were still quite attractive to us relative to other geographies around the world.
On the developed market side I think the single biggest difficulty that we and a lot of our competitors face is Europe and I think that’s true across a lot of businesses.
Our diagnostics business has weathered the economy and the actions in Europe as well but a lot of other businesses are struggling with Europe and I think that’s true for us.
I think it's true for our competitors.
We have watched I can’t say growth rates it's more like decline rates price pressures and volume rates and so forth and I know that others have been you know hit harder than we have but nevertheless we’re down in these developed markets about 10% and you know so we can be up 10% and emerging markets down in the developed markets and it's sort of cancels out.
I like these emerging markets to keep growing and get to be a much bigger portion but we have got very close to a 50-50 split right now where what we’re struggling within in developed markets with price and utilization cuts and other things is being offset by growth in emerging markets which we intend but the way we deal with those developed markets in quite different.
There is fair amount of expense reduction focus restructuring et cetera.
And I know this has been one that you know we have been challenged on from time to time and previous question of Mike Weinstein you know (indiscernible) question I think on this one.
I have to say it's a fair question.
The emerging part of this is going quite well and the developed part it's uphill.
The legacy of the business is you know a combination of businesses we have acquired well Legacy Abbott and so forth.
I think if we were starting with a clean sheet of paper we target those markets that have the most attractive attributes but the fact is we have got a lot of legacy markets here in developed economies that we have been in for a long time and they continue to experience economic pressure the most fundamental of those being Europe.
So we continue to look at that particular geography and that particular segment of business and deal with it differently than we deal with what we deal with is a fairly attractive growth opportunity in lot of the emerging markets.
And maybe switching to diagnostics in the U.S.
specifically can you comment on the molecular business? I mean you’ve pretty strong trends in point of care as well as the Core Lab segment and I would have thought there will be some potential to sort of cross sell or leverage to different platforms but it was a pretty tough quarter in the U.S.
in the molecular segment.
Any further detail you can provide on market dynamics or company specific factors?  David this is Brian I will kick it off and if Miles can add more color.
In the U.S.
you know first of all when we say our underlying franchise of infectious disease is growing very strongly.
It's doing very well.
We did have some comparable’s with respect to how you realize kind of the companion diagnostics revenue.
We had some revenue in 2012 in the quarter that did not repeat this is kind of a little bit more choppy in that respect and also we just have a little bit of an impact from the timing of when we seize the distribution agreement but that doesn’t impact the underlying business.
The underlying business is poised to continue to do well with the focus on infectious disease.
I think to look at the full year it's probably more reflective of how to think about molecular in the U.S.
and we do expect a step-up from that as we move into 2014 with our continued success and focus on infectious disease.
I think it's really important to note in this business you know there are two that 60% of the sales are outside the U.S.
and you can see the double digit growth there we’re doing very well in the emerging markets in our platforms in infectious disease and so we like the growth rates that we see overall for molecular.
Okay and then maybe just last one strategic question.
As I look at the evolution of the “new Abbott” story over the past 12 months.
I think we started a year ago with sort of a growth company of mid to high single digit top line growth obviously it's a well-documented challenges that emerge over the course of 2013.
You had a pretty obviously significant increase in the dividend in the third quarter of this year and it seems like we’re shifting from a growth company to a capital return company.
How should we think about the strategic positioning of Abbott longer term and Miles where you’re taking the business growth first capital return M&amp;A versus shareholder buybacks and things like that from a capital deployment standpoint?  Well I think we think about the company much as we described.
It's definitely a growth platform with an intention of growth.
You know the things that I would say probably disappointed me or set us back last year largely foreign exchange which was a big deal.
I mean that hit the top line and the bottom line.
And we were able to offset that but that was one thing.
And I think the recall we had in the Nutrition business was couple of $100 million.
That’s a big hit.
And that particular business is one of our big growth drivers.
I would say strategically I am pretty pleased with how the base core businesses are all performing particularly relative to the nature of the geographies and economies and so forth out there.
I think that’s all trending pretty well.
The one business where it’s got a lot of my attention and focus as we just talked about is the branded generic pharmaceutical business where I would say strategically I would like this one to be improving faster.
And what I call your attention to is after we acquired AMO I’d say analysts and some shareholders had a fair amount of skepticism about the performance of that business for some time.
And admittedly it took a few years to pick up momentum there but today that business is churning at a fairly steady double-digit growth rate.
It’s gaining share.
It’s doing quite well.
My own impatience would have been that it do that much faster than it did and I am always pushing for faster progress or faster impact in the performance of the business I guess not just for your expectations but for my own.
And yet we got to where we wanted to be.
We have seen – we saw with the vascular business terrific performance.
We have seen steady quarter-to-quarter sequential improvements.
We have gained share in the vascular business across the board.
Every geography we are number one in the stent business around the world.
The AMO business is doing exceptionally well that way.
Diagnostics has had a very steady sequential track record of improving growth.
The frustration I had got is the pace of that improvement in EPD right now and it’s got the focus of our management team and my focus.
It’s the only place I am really – I guess strategically a little frustrated but a lot of that has to do with the nature of the developed economies.
And I think you are going to hear that from a lot of our competitors and a lot of other businesses.
So I would say first of all in no way do I think we are stepping away from an intention of growth or focus on growth or focus on share gain or a focus on geographies where the dynamics are frankly around growth.
I think that’s all still very valid very true.
At the same time we and other companies well run we accumulate a fair amount of cash.
And our investors are looking for a return.
And I think if we are not able to deploy some of that cash to strategic opportunities or we disproportionately accumulate cash relative to strategic opportunities we look at the shape of our balance sheet we look at the shape of all of that.
And I think if investors – we have got the attention between the long-term and of course the quarter.
And each quarter when we got to report to our investors how we are doing but I think also investors would like the constant feedback of a healthy return particularly in uncertain economies in uncertain time.
Our company has had a history for probably more than 30 years of very steady dividend growth and return to investors that’s got a certain identity and a certain appeal to a lot of investors.
And we have had a fairly steady track record of share repurchase.
We have had a steady track record of pretty significant profitability and cash accumulation and cash generation.
We have had a good track record with M&amp;A and other things.
And I think we try to keep all that in balance so that our investors are benefiting both from the growth profile over the long-term and a good healthy cash return when economies are more uncertain and on a steady reliable basis.
So I would tell you I don’t think it’s black and white you are not one or the other we happen to be both.
That’s been the hallmark of the company for decades that we have been a growth vehicle.
And we have had a nice healthy cash return of dividends and share buyback.
And I think if we are successful profitable generating that kind of cash that’s what we ought to do is find that balance.
Okay that’s helpful perspective.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities.
Good morning.
Thanks for taking the question.
Let me start on EPD Miles on the last call you expressed your commitment to the business.
I guess I am wondering within EPD I mean you are obviously more excited about the emerging market opportunity.
Do you need to have an EPD business in the developed market? That’s my first question.
Need? No.
It depends; I think it depends on the dynamics in any given market.
I don’t think any of us are pleased with the pressures or decline if you will of growth rates in say Europe but at the same time Larry it's extremely profitable business even with all the price pressure utilization pressure and volume pressure.
It's a very profitable business.
So I think our challenge is it's always how long will these circumstances last.
How long will these dynamics last? Is this a trend that doesn’t change? Is there a bottom? Is there a turn? Is there how long does this endure? And what’s the best matter for us to drive best value for our owners our investors our shareholders in that time.
You can get hung up on the optics of growth rate and say Geez it's hurting it's diluting my growth rate but at the same time I think the notion that it's making a fair amount of money and it's profitable and there is value in that.
So I think our job is to figure out best way to optimally derive that value for our investor and that’s a trade-off between what we can do here over some duration of time relative to how long we expect market conditions to exist or you know what’s the best deployment of the asset value you know in the event we can drive the right value forward but when it's profitable as it is that’s a tough trade-off.
It's helpful and then on adult nutrition can you talk about the impact of the divestures and any quantification when that lapse in the adult nutrition business in the U.S.? Thanks.
Larry this is Brian you’re seeing in the fourth quarter on the adult segment in the U.S.
around a 4 percentage point impact headwind and that also does spill into the first quarter as well.
As we’re talking about you know some of the things impacting first quarter that will be one item that spills into the first quarter of 2014 as well for the U.S.
adult segment and nutrition.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
Two questions first on the infant nutritional business you mentioned on the call that the recovery in emerging markets China et cetera was on track.
I was wondering if you could share with us some evidence that suggest that things are on track was December better than November is there a script data that you’re tracking? Any color that would be helpful to give us confidence that the business recovers other than just from easy comps and then as a follow-up…  Go ahead Glenn I’m chuckling a little bit because I’m thinking no we just made this stuff up.
Of course I will answer you in just a second go ahead.
And then just second just on operating margin goals it looks like you’re going to get to the nutritional operating margin goals sooner than expected and it looks like diagnostics we’re going to hit those goals quickly too.
So I’m wondering as we look at nutritionals is 25% a realistic new goal and with respect to diagnostics are we in the late innings or is there another opportunity for more expansion there? Just you know qualitatively if you can help us think about the longer term goals there.
Thanks.
All right let me go back to the beginning.
First of all evidence of recovery.
You know there is three major geographies that we’re paying a lot of attention to in the recovery this recall that we experienced in nutrition.
It's China Vietnam and Saudi Arabia all of which are fairly important markets to us.
We do get market share data; we get it from multiple sources in these countries.
We get off take data meaning what leaves the shelf we get a fair amount of actually measured data.
We get it from multiple sources and then we get a fair amount of anecdotal data as well.
And we do track it it is numerical it is measurable.
We’re seeing sequential month to month in fact we got a fairly I would say robust model that’s been pretty accurate for us that’s predictive that takes into account holidays buying patterns consumer patterns all that stuff.
Believe it or not in all these markets so we can do that.
And there is a bit of a lag maybe a month or month and a half in some cases but and it varies by geography but we’re able to measure our progress.
We’re ahead of our progress in China our model; we’re ahead of our expectation.
We’re ahead of our expectation.
We are ahead of our expectation in Vietnam and we are a little behind in Saudi Arabia.
And so we are able to measure that.
We are able to see sequential evidence.
We have got enough data points now that we can trust our forecasting trust our model trust our data trust our feedback.
Early mid and late fall we didn’t have enough data points yet to be confident of the kind of trends we were seeing because there is some not cyclicality but there is some up and down in the trends depending on holidays and other things.
And we have seen enough of that now.
We have had enough months of recovery that we can pretty reliably forecast for ourselves and for you how we will recover in the various countries.
So I would say yes there is definite evidence definite data.
We definitely can see it and I am pleased by what I see.
Frankly I think our teams in those countries are doing an excellent job.
It gives us not only data about us but data about segments data about competitors etcetera and what we – how we believe all of that’s going.
So I am pleased with what I see.
With regard to operating margin goals or even gross margin goals I’d say for diagnostics late innings I think there is a point where even if we could do better I am not sure I would want to.
I would always look for improvements in gross margin but then you have discretionary spending in R&amp;D or sales and marketing expenses etcetera that then get down to operating margin.
And I’d say in the diagnostics business I’d say late innings because I’d like to be putting more and more into R&amp;D there.
I think we have got a nice model from a sales and marketing standpoint but as you know in the diagnostics businesses we have got half a dozen systems major systems in developments and these are expensive programs all of which are tracking very well as we renew the system platforms that are in the markets.
Over the next five six years here there is going to be a steady drumbeat of new product coming that’s going to drive the growth of this business globally on top of the installed base we already have.
And I think that those are very important initiatives.
So I’d like to be putting money into R&amp;D and that’s not to say or more money into R&amp;D.
That’s not to say you should expect any kind of diminishment in bottom line you should not.
But I would like to be improving the gross margin in order to be able to invest more in what we would call discretionary spending in R&amp;D and maybe even SG&amp;A.
So I would say that one.
What we have managed profitability I think brilliantly and yes they are ahead of schedule.
I think it’s delivered for the investor the shareholder and the business.
And strategically it also needs to be reinvesting in itself as we go along which it’s doing and I think it’s found the nice balance.
On Nutritionals I think there is still a lot of opportunity.
And I would not go so far as to set a specific numerical target for you as ambitious as you might be but I would probably say the same thing we are always looking to improve our gross margin and to the extent that drops through to the bottom line that business is not as expense intensive in R&amp;D.
R&amp;D doesn’t cost as much as a percent of sales.
And so it’s a highly productive R&amp;D organization in terms of new product development new product innovation etcetera.
And it’s got a low percentage of sales spend on R&amp;D.
It’s much more SG&amp;A or marketing intensive.
If I were going to spend more money promoting that business I do it with sales and marketing lines.
And I think that as the gross margin continues to improve there which I expect it will substantially I think there will be a sharing between dropping it to the bottom line for the investor and reinvesting further in sales and marketing and expansion because there is so much opportunity particularly internationally for this business.
So I think that’s about how I would characterize that I do expect to continue to see margin expansion there.
And I would say that these businesses in particular all the businesses will put a fair amount of focus on margin expansion and they have gotten it.
And you have seen that in the gross margin line in our reporting.
You have also seen exchange foreign exchange erode some of that or in some businesses like the vascular business while they have had great improvement also in gross margin and yields and productivity.
We have also seen price pressures that they have had to absorb.
And I think that the fact that under some of the pricing and utilization pressures we have seen in Europe and other geographies and some of our businesses over the last several years and particularly last year the margin improvement initiatives that we have had had not only mitigated that but continued to improve margin anyway.
So I think there is more to come.
Alright great.
Thanks for the color Miles.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Rick Wise from Stifel.
Good morning everybody.
Tom if I could ask you again on gross margin.
So the 55% gross margin guidance you said included 90 basis points of negative FX the diabetes and other offsets.
Was that I assume that plant shut down is reflected in that as well.
Can you break that portion out just more specifically?  they are largely offset by those two factors.
Okay (indiscernible) it's part of the gross margin headwinds when I call temporary excess capacity from the three new nutritional facilities is that a big factor?  No there is a little bit of a startup there as well but again I don’t think that’s overall meaningful to the overall comparison year-over-year for the entire corporation.
Certainly there is some cost in there but they have a lot of other good things going on in terms of their margin improvement programs that overall are driving an improvement in the nutrition gross margin in 2014.
And one last quick one the buyback is that gets you to the middle of your guidance range or the high end? How do we think about that and maybe you can kind of whether you do an accelerated share repurchase.
Thanks so much.
The guidance is the guidance it's the range and obviously our baseline expectation is to be within the range and if the year goes well it will be in the high end and it's the challenges we’re going to work not to be the low the middle.
So that’s the way we think about the guidance and what I would say is what is a definite part of the plan is to buy back shares roughly in the range we talked about today and certainly that’s the baseline you can count on as you build your model for 2014 and there is no plan at this time to do an accelerated structure but that’s something we would look at and we will think about.
Thank you.
My next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen and Company.
Josh your line is open please check your mute feature.
And we’re sorry we’re getting no response we will move on to the next question.
Our next question today is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
Just focusing on the vascular business.
I know you had commented on strong growth in MitraClip I was wondering if you would be willing just to provide a baseline number of where it ended this year with European sales and then just thoughts around it as you’re rolling this out in the U.S.
just the strategy given the reimbursement environment.
MitraClip had strong growth in Europe.
I think it ended the year approximately around a $130 million.
We expect some additional approvals in certain countries there to continue our growth in Europe so we expect another year of strong growth with MitraClip in Europe region in 2014.
Now I will say with respect to the U.S.
we were very pleased with the decision that was made by the panel last year to receive the approval that we have for the degenerative mitral regurgitation patient in the U.S.
at high risk.
It's a pretty I will say modest way to think about but we’re going to take it the right way in terms of how we approach our centers and those large cardiac specialty centers that are capable and have the expertise to work with the MitraClip.
Again another year of strong growth I think we can think about probably approaching close to 200 million as we move into 2014 but clearly between the Europe side and the U.S.
side a nice contributor to our overall vascular growth.
We continue to work towards also the reimbursements and improving our reimbursements there I think we have discussed before that we ultimately foresee this coming more in line with the (indiscernible) line of reimbursement in the U.S.
and again I know that (indiscernible) have submitted for the national coverage as well we also submitted for what you know what would also be a special add on technology indication but we will have more color to provide for you on both of those in the later part of 2014.
And then I got just more broadly just in structural heart how do you just kind of see MitraClip fit again? Do you need to surround it with additional programs to really have that platform be competitive or do you think looking ahead just having a transcatheter mitral valve repair product alone will be successful within Abbott?  Kristen this is Miles.
I think it could standalone quite easily but I think we are always looking for more innovation the more opportunity to expand our position in a given treatment segment.
So I would put up more in the desire rather than need.
I think it’s given the lack of therapies out there to treat patients it clearly can standalone but to the extent that other therapies evolve over time here it’s certainly to the benefit of the patient and the business to expand the offering.
Right.
And then just on the stent business I was wondering if you could offer any additional commentary just on the Absorb product the one you are seeing in terms of market share positioning in the accounts in which you are in? And then just to remind on the timing to the U.S.
I think you had mentioned that you expected to complete enrollment in the U.S.
study this year.
Just wanted to confirm that?  Let me address share and then I will hand it to Brian to talk about U.S.
First of all I am very pleased with how the overall shares of the stent business have evolved.
We have grown share in all of our geographies.
We hold the number one position in stents across Europe the U.S.
Japan etcetera.
We have not only held share but gained share.
I think that’s been gratifying for the breadth and the strength and the quality of the product line.
I think it’s been a challenging environment to some degree from a competitive or pricing standpoint.
I think I expect that to mitigate some here going into this year and we are seeing that as we see sequential improvement in growth at least in our own business.
And as regards to Absorb I think the acceptance the use of Absorb continues to improve but share continues to improve and continues to grow in many accounts.
And then I would have to note that while the trend has been a fair amount of price degradation in this segment Absorb is selling at a premium to metal drug-eluting stents etcetera.
So it continues to gain share.
It continues to gain a share of procedures in accounts where it’s being used.
It continues to grow very nicely and do so at some premium to what are truly good quality stents out there in the metal drug-eluding stent category.
So with that let me give you to Brian to talk about the U.S.
Yes.
So Kristen obviously Absorb had a great contribution as Miles had mentioned to Europe and our share gains there year-over-year.
In the U.S.
as we are expecting to complete the enrollment in 2014 and that also goes for China as well.
We just completed enrollment for Japan.
I think the way to think about this too is we are only in half of the market the worldwide market today if you think about it in terms of being in Europe but we still have another half of the world to go here.
And so by completing the enrollments we set ourselves out there to be the only one in this kind of technology with the opportunity to continue to penetrate and achieve the workforce status we expected to.
We have left time for one more question.
Thank you.
Our final question today is from Jason Bedford from Raymond James.
Good morning.
Thanks for squeezing me in.
Just wanted to revisit an earlier question on EPD still unclear as to the source of the sluggishness in developed markets is it increased competition is it a demand issue is it price? And then just as a follow-up can you kind of give us the estimated market growth rates in EPD and if it’s easier you can split it between emerging markets and developed markets?  In the developed markets it’s a little bit of the items you discussed.
I mean price as we have talked about the couple of years it’s probably been running at a rate twice what it had been prior to maybe 2012 and it has been very low single-digits and has probably doubled for a period of time that seems to be mitigating a little bit as we go forward.
And I would say the balance is basically either austerity in some of the countries where scripts are actually down or in some cases in our portfolio a few of our products have were at the end of lives in Europe.
We did have a few of those.
We had a few patented products and some of those went off patent.
And each one is relatively minor but that’s been part of what’s going on in the developed world.
I would say in terms of market growth rates it depends on markets obviously you know India for us is a key market and while it's slowed probably into the mid-single digit range in 2013 IMS forecast it will be back into that double digit range in 2014 which is a positive for us.
I would say overall in the key emerging markets you know we’re seeing basic market growth probably in that mid-single range maybe even a little bit better in a country like Russia for example and I think most investors are familiar that Europe has been a pretty sluggish market overall from a volume perspective and that’s carried over into our business as well.
And then just lastly for me getting back to the discussion on cash repatriation.
Do you anticipate that you will be more active with M&amp;A in ’14 than you were in ’13?  I think it all depends on the opportunities out there.
I don’t feel cash constrained about any of that.
I feel more constrained by what I view as a not terribly robust set of opportunities or valuations.
I’m always vigilant for opportunities for the company but they got to be good fits strategically and they got to be good valuations.
Okay thanks Jason and thank you operator and thank you for all your questions.

Some statements made today maybe forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the expected financial results for 2014.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2013.
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.
In today’s conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott’s ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which exclude the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Okay.
Thanks Brian.
Good morning.
This morning we reported first quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.41 above our guidance range.
Operating margin exceeded our target and sales increased modestly in the quarter in line with our expectations as Tom will discuss in more detail in a moment.
We are confirming our full year 2014 ongoing earnings per share guidance which is for double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range.
Going forward we continue to expect accelerating sales growth as the year progresses and double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth starting in the second quarter.
We are recovering share in our international and Nutrition business.
We are continuing to drive above market sales growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics.
We are launching new products to capture share in our Medical Devices business and we are on track to expand full year operating margin.
I’ll summarize first quarter performance before turning the call over to Tom and Brian for more detailed commentary.
Diagnostics sales increased 5% in the quarter driven by continued momentum in Core Laboratory Diagnostics in both developed and emerging markets.
In Molecular Diagnostics sales increased strong double digits in our core infectious disease testing segment where our best-in-class assays provide the opportunity for significant share expansion.
In our Diagnostics pipeline we are investing in the development of multiple new instrument platforms that we will launch over the next several years.
Our Medical Devices includes Vascular Diabetes and Vision Care businesses.
In our Vascular business international sales representing 65% of our global business increased nearly 4% in the quarter growth has been driven by a number of new products including our new peripheral stent Supera and our structural heart device MitraClip and in our drug-eluting stent product portfolio we are driving increased penetration of our Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold ABSORB.
In the international markets where ABSORB is approved and actively promoted it’s now approaching 20% of our drug-eluting portfolio revenue.
We are making significant progress to bring it to three major markets where it’s not yet available the U.S.
Japan and China which represent more than 50% of the world’s coronary stent market.
We’ve recently completed patient enrollment in the ABSORB randomized clinical trials required for approval in these geographies.
Vascular sales in the U.S.
were lower in the first quarter due to trialing of a competitive drug-eluting stent we anticipate better U.S.
performance in the coming quarters as we recapture drug-eluting stent share focusing on the superior profile of XIENCE Xpedition and accelerate growth of our broad vascular portfolio including MitraClip and now Supera.
Supera received U.S.
FDA approval last month and expands our endovascular portfolio with the best-in-class stent technology.
It treats blockages of the superficial femoral artery or SFA one of the largest and fastest growing segments in the peripheral stent market.
In Diabetes Care sales were in line with our expectations.
In the U.S.
as we’ve discussed the market has been impacted by the implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program.
Our management team has navigated this environment well versus the competition remaining focused on gaining share in the more attractive market segments.
Outside of the U.S.
emerging market growth was strong in the quarter and we are making progress towards CE Mark in the second half of this year for our next-generation sensing technology.
And in Vision Care sales increased 10% in the quarter driven by above market growth of our cataract lens business.
We expect double-digit sales growth for the full year with continued positive momentum from new products including our TECNIS Toric Intraocular Lens in the U.S.
our TECNIS OptiBlue Lens in Japan and our new Catalys laser cataract system and several additional product launches throughout this year In Established Pharmaceuticals total operational sales performance was roughly in line with our expectation in our key emerging markets for EPD strong growth in Brazil and India was offset by a temporary decline related to an expected plant shutdown for capacity expansion purposes to meet increasing demand.
At the same time EPD leadership is making progress on initiatives to accelerate growth by further aligning its commercial strategy with the opportunities these emerging markets represent.
We continue to expect better momentum in EPD in the second half of this year with improved market growth in India and the benefit of additional plant capacity to meet sales demand for key products.
And over the next several years we anticipate continued improvement in EPD’s growth rate as sales and emerging markets become a larger component of these business.
In Nutrition as I mentioned we are recapturing share in our International Pediatric Nutrition business following the supplier recall initiated last August.
As I discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call we are executing on a recovery plan and regularly monitoring our progress.
We remained on track to return to pre-call levels in the third quarter.
In the second half of this year we are well-positioned in Nutrition for double-digit sales growth and operating margin expansion as we begin to anniversary the supplier recall.
We opened three new manufacturing facilities to support strong global demand for both adult and pediatric nutrition.
We continue to execute on our margin expansion initiatives and launched a number of new products into the new market segments across several key geographies.
In the coming months we'll launch new adult nutrition brand in Japan our largest adult market outside of U.S.
and over the course of the year we are launching several new pediatric nutrition products in fast-growing market segments in China and other emerging geographies.
This includes a new infant formula product Eleva we launched in China just last week.
These innovations bring advanced nutrition to meet the needs of our customers drive share expansion and grow the market.
So in summary our first quarter ongoing earnings per share results were better than our expectations.
We continue to expect accelerating sales growth as we progress through the year particularly in the second half and we’re on track to achieving another year of double-digit earnings per share growth.
I will now turn the call over to Tom and Brian.
Tom? Thanks Miles.
Today we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of $0.41 above our guidance range.
As we forecasted in January first quarter sales increased modestly on an operational basis.
Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 3% on sales in the quarter also consistent with our previous estimates.
As a result reported sales declined 2.5% in the quarter.
It’s important to keep our first quarter sales growth in perspective.
As we indicated in January we expected modest growth before exchange as we recover from the 2013 supplier recall nutrition and work through certain sales comparison.
We are right on track with the sales progression we expected in January with sales growth before exchange essentially on our planned forecast.
And exchange was close to the forecast we provided as well and what should be the most challenging quarter of the year for currency.
So as sales are progressing as we planned our full year forecast for sales growth remains unchanged.
First quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 54% of sales also in line with our guidance.
Our overall spending levels in the first quarter were below forecast we provided in January.
Ongoing R&amp;D came in about $20 million below our expectations which was simply a result of timing.
We expect to fully fund our R&amp;D initiatives over the remainder of the year.
Ongoing SG&amp;A spending was around $80 million lower than we planned.
Approximately half of this was timing which we expect to balance out over the last three quarters.
The remainder reflects our continuing focus on managing down G&amp;A costs and is available to either reinvest in the business or carry through the earnings for the year.
So as we factor first quarter ongoing EPS of $0.41 into our thinking on the full year around half of the over delivery compared to our guidance is attributable to the timing of spending which we expect to balance out over the remaining three quarters.
Regarding our full year 2014 outlook for the P&amp;L we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid single digits.
Based on current exchange rates we expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 1% on our full year reported sales with most significant impact in the first half of the year.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low-to-mid-single digits for the full year 2014 consistent with our forecast in January.
Operational sales growth is expected to be driven by continued strong growth in Diagnostics and Vision Care and sales growth accelerations in nutrition and established pharmaceuticals.
We continued to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% of sales for the full year which reflects the negative impact of around 50 basis points from foreign exchange.
We also continued forecast ongoing R&amp;D somewhat above 6% of sales ongoing SG&amp;A expense of approximately 30% of sales and an expansion of our full year adjusted operating margin by approximately 60 basis points in 2014.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter we are forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52 reflecting double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range.
We forecast operational sales growth in the low-to-mid-single digits in the second quarter.
At current exchanges rates we’d expect a negative impact from exchange of approximately 1.5% resulting in reported sales in the low single digits.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 54.5% of sales ongoing SG&amp;A expense of approximately 30.5% of sales and ongoing R&amp;D expense somewhat above 6% of sales for the second quarter.
We project specified items of $0.29 in the second quarter reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release.
As previously indicated we expect the pace of our sales and ongoing EPS growth would accelerate throughout the year as product launches and key initiatives ramp and as comparisons become more favorable.
For the second half of 2014 we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid to upper single digit and steady operating margin expansion supported by our continuing efforts to manage G&amp;A expenses.
So in summary sales in the first quarter were in line with our expectations.
We exceeded our ongoing EPS guidance and we are confirming our full year ongoing EPS guidance range of $2.16 to $2.26.
As we start the year we are well-positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2014.
With that I will turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook.
Brian? Thank you Tom.
This morning I will review our first quarter 2014 performance and second quarter sales outlook by business.
As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
Overall our first quarter sales increased modestly and sales in emerging markets grew mid-single digits both in line with our expectations as we work through a couple of year-over-year comparison items one in International Nutrition and one in our Established Pharmaceuticals division.
We estimate that these items impacted Abbott’s year-over-year emerging market sales growth by approximately 4.5 percentage points in the quarter.
I will now discuss each of our businesses.
In our Diagnostics business sales increased 5% in the first quarter slightly ahead of our expectations.
Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased more than 5% in the first quarter as if that it continues to deliver above market performance in both developed and emerging markets.
U.S.
sales increased 11% primarily due to several large health system customers selecting Abbott’s integrated and flexible solutions to manage their testing volumes and increase operational efficiencies.
International sales grew 4% in the quarter driven by continued growth in emerging markets.
We continue to broaden and differentiate our ARCHITECT assay menu and launched a new diabetes test in the U.S.
in April.
To address the growing prevalence of diabetes in the United States our new test provides fast accurate results to help laboratories manage the anticipated increase in demand for testing.
This test aids physicians with diagnosing and monitoring diabetes as well as identifying people at risk for developing diabetes.
In Molecular Diagnostics worldwide sales increased 5.6% in the first quarter with international sales up 12.6% led by continued strong growth in infectious disease testing and double-digit growth in emerging markets.
In the U.S.
growth of infectious disease testing which is our largest segment where we have best-in-class assays was offset by the expected timing of the conclusion of a distribution agreement for a respiratory test.
In Point-of-Care Diagnostics worldwide sales increased nearly 3% with international sales growing double digits as this business had increased its focus on expanding in select European and emerging markets.
In the first quarter the U.S.
business experienced somewhat slower -- somewhat longer excuse me purchasing cycles and reduced utilization rates in the hospitals.
We started to see stabilization of U.S.
order patterns in March and April and continued to focus on building momentum in international markets.
For the second quarter in our global diagnostics business we are forecasting mid-to-high single-digit operational sales growth.
In Medical Devices sales in our vascular business increased 1% in the quarter.
International vascular sales increased nearly 4% driven by continued momentum of our drug-eluting stent product portfolio including ABSORB and double-digit sales growth of MitraClip as well as our endovascular products.
We expect a number of new product launches to drive improved performance over the next several quarters.
As Miles mentioned in March we received U.S.
FDA approval for our Supera peripheral stent which treats blockages in the superficial femoral artery or SFA.
The global SFA market is growing at a mid-to-high single-digit pace.
With the approval of Supera Abbott now has one of the most comprehensive and competitive portfolios in the peripheral market.
We are also making good progress to bring ABSORB to the United States China and Japan over the next few years.
ABSORB clinical data demonstrating positive long-term outcomes was presented at the American College of Cardiology Medical meeting.
We expect to present one-year clinical result in the second half of this year from ABSORB II which is the first randomized trial to compare ABSORB to standard of care.
As we look ahead to the second quarter 2014 we expect sales in our global Vascular business to increase in the low single digits on an operational basis.
In Diabetes Care global sales in the first quarter decreased 9.5% in line with our expectations.
International sales which represent approximately 65% of total Diabetes Care sells grew for the sixth consecutive quarter increasing 4% lead by double-digit growth in the emerging market.
As Miles mentioned we are also moving our new investigational next-generation sensing technology through development and expect to receive European CE Mark in the second half of this year.
In the U.S.
as anticipated sales were impacted by the carryover effect from implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program for Medicare patients in July of last year.
For the second quarter in our global Diabetes business we continue to forecast a low double-digit decline on an operational basis.
In Vision Care we achieved 10% sales growth in the first quarter above our expectations with double-digit growth in both emerging and developed markets.
Sales of our cataract products increased double digits and represents more than 65% of our Vision Care business where we are capturing market share with multiple new products.
As we’ve discussed in the past we continue to make good progress with the launch of several new cataract lenses in both the United States and Japan.
In addition our new Catalys laser cataract system has received very good feedback from our customers as it continues to penetrate high volume cataract centers.
We expect continued double-digit performance in our Vision Care business throughout this year as we introduced more new products.
This includes first quarter launches in Japan of TECNIS Toric lenses for patients with the stigmatism and TECNIS OptiBlue preloaded lens which improves the ease of use for the cataract surgeon and enhances predictability of the procedure.
For the second quarter of 2014 we expect our global Vision Care business to continue to grow double digits on an operational basis.
In our Established Pharmaceuticals business or EPD sales in the quarter decreased modestly.
Sales in our developed and other market segments decreased 1.5% in the quarter.
Developed markets performed largely in line with our expectations partially offset by better than expected performance in a number of emerging markets that are included in this business segment.
Sales in our key emerging market segments were relatively flat in the quarter.
As we expected year-over-year sales comparison in this business were affected by the timing of supply of key products in our women’s health portfolio primarily due to an expected plant shutdown for capacity expansion purposes.
As Miles mentioned we expect sales growth in key emerging markets to accelerate over the course of the year.
For the second quarter of 2014 we are forecasting sales in our Established Pharmaceuticals business to grow in the low single digits on an operational basis.
And lastly our Nutrition business where global sale decreased 1.7% in the first quarter in line with our previously provided guidance.
As expected international pediatric sales were impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year comparisons created by the previously reported 2013 supplier recall.
The impact of this event is estimated to have reduced international pediatric operational sales by approximately $75 million or 12 percentage points in the quarter.
We are recovering share in the affected market and expect to launch a number of new products in China and other emerging markets to help drive sales growth.
Late last year we launched our Similac simple pack into the online channel in China and just this month we launched a new product Eleva that will further enhance our competitiveness in the premium segments of the Chinese and some formula market.
International adult sales increased nearly 12.5 percentage points in the quarter driven by strong growth of our Ensure brand along with execution of several market development initiatives.
We continue to shape and grow priority international markets and expect to launch several new products this year including the launch of a new adult brand [Enavo] (ph) in Japan our largest adult nutrition market outside the U.S.
[Enavo] (ph) is a next-generation follow-on product for our market leading Ensure brand.
In the United States the severe winter weather did have some impact on Ensure PediaSure and performance to nutrition brands in the retail segment.
As a market leader we partnered with retailers late in the quarter to launch demand-creation programs to boost consumer demand and are seeing positive early results.
In our infant nutrition business we recently launched Similac with OptiGRO which contains Abbott’s exclusive blend of DHA Lutein and Vitamin E to support brain eye and immune system development.
Lastly on a global basis we continued to expand our manufacturing presence in nutrition to be closer to our customers and at the same time further expand operating margin.
We expect to open three new manufacturing facilities in the second quarter this year in China India and the United States to support strong global demand for our products.
And we remain on track to achieve an operating margin ratio of more than 20% sales in our nutrition business by 2015.
For the second quarter we are forecasting mid single-digit sales growth on an operational basis for our global nutrition business.
So in summary in the first quarter sales were in line with our expectations and we delivered ongoing earnings per share of $0.41 ahead of our guidance.
Moving forward we remain on track to deliver continued margin expansion and expect sales growth acceleration in our nutrition established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses.
We are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth.
We will now open the call for questions.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
Thank you and good morning everyone.
First I had just one strategic question and a follow-up on the financial side.
Maybe Miles you could touch just talk a little bit more about your evolving views around capital allocation.
As I sort of think about how the Abbott story has gone over the last year post the spin.
I think we’ve sort of seen an evolution in the growth rate as it relates to the topline.
And correspondingly a sort of change in the way you thought about capital deployment with the big dividend increase last October is followed by a fairly big buyback announcement at the beginning of this year.
But maybe you can sort of help frame for us how you are thinking about using cash from here in the context of how you’re seeing growth play out because even with the buyback and dividend you still sit on a pretty healthy net cash balance and if you believe any of the analysts’ forecast out there it should grow pretty meaningfully in the next several years.
Yeah you noticed that did you? Thank you David.
Let me take you back a little bit at the time of the split.
When we split we split with AbbVie the balance sheet to debt et cetera.
And we did all that proportionately with cash flow at the time and we set our dividend rate on each side proportionately as well.
And so AbbVie ended up with a very healthy dividend somewhat disproportionate to what Abbott had paid prior to that.
And Abbott dividend as a percent of EPS was lower and we started out that way primarily and the combined dividend as you’ll recall was higher than Abbott in the past.
And we started out the year I would say waiting to see how the split was going to progress cash flows et cetera.
And debating the appropriate cash return et cetera because Abbott as you know has had a long history of healthy dividend dividend growth et cetera and so in the fall made the decision to increase the dividend back to a percent of EPS.
It was around 40% I think at the time.
And that’s dividend being paid now.
So we made that adjustment because I think that the identity of this investment to stock has always been both growth and cash return.
And it’s been a very stable reliable performer that way because of the combination of the growth and the cash return.
As far as share repurchases have gone we’ve been steady share repurchasers year-to-year.
There have been some times when we’ve taken it lower sometimes we’ve taken it higher and so forth because there is a limit to how much cash you want to accumulate because cash generally isn’t earning much on your balance sheet these days.
So we look at where our own deployment of that cash will go.
And if it starts to accumulate at some level beyond the company’s good use of it then we think about combination of either dividend or share repurchases.
And that’s always our thought around that.
We keep our debt in a proper balance we believe.
As you note our cash flow is strong and in no way have we changed strategy.
I think there is plenty of ammo on the balance sheet should we see opportunities in acquisitions or licensing or whatever deals maybe out there that can enhance or add to our business I don’t feel constrained at all by the balance sheet.
So I think investors expect us to steward the assets well and if there are say excess cash or excess assets that we don’t foresee an immediate use for that we can invest at a better rate I think a return to investors is always kind of a first priority.
So we have a steady policy around dividend.
We have a steady policy around share repurchases.
We’ve had significant share repurchase earlier in the year this year and I still feel like I have got plenty of cash for M&amp;A activity and not much constrained on borrowing capacity should something significantly larger come along et cetera.
So I would say that there has really been no change in philosophy.
I do believe in a strong cash return to investors and we will keep looking at our dividend and our share buyback that way and I continue to look at M&amp;A activity.
Are you there? Fair to say continued balance use of cash but no necessary urgency that sort of up big M&amp;A as we have seen elsewhere sort of in healthcare over the past couple of months? Well I never feel push for M&amp;A because of accumulation of cash.
I would say M&amp;A is driven much more strategically by opportunity that fits our business.
And I think in the last couple of calls with investors I have commented that I haven’t seen a lot on the radar screen and I would say during the split there is only so much integration or disintegration activity that an organization can absorb or sustain.
So during the time of the split some of the M&amp;A or deal activity we did was rather modest or smaller deals that we are particularly focused on our Medical Device business.
And while a fair amount of the disintegration activity is ongoing in a lot of our back office areas with AbbVie.
It’s also coming to a conclusion here in the coming years.
So without forecasting anything specific we have always been opportunistic about a lot of different opportunities we have been interested in in different geographies.
And tracking those and it’s possible that could kind of find its way back to the radar screen here.
Okay.
That’s helpful.
Maybe just a quick financial follow-up for Tom.
On the P&amp;L understandingly the gross margin has a lot of moving parts in their FX you have got the plant shutdown? You did mention in your prepared remarks a tight G&amp;A control and focus on that line.
Could you give us maybe some senses to where we are sort of in the sort of self-help type or cost cutting that you can do to help improve the margin profile here? Certainly we factored some of that into our original plan we worked hard last year to identify areas of efficiency and I would say we made some initial steps when we put the plan together and as you know in the second half of the year in our forecast the SG&amp;A ratio gets better and that’s due in part to some of those initiatives starting to benefit the P&amp;L.
But I think we have created a culture here and people understand what we are trying to do in terms of focusing on this G&amp;A area.
I think a little bit of what we saw in the first quarter is that playing out and people are really working hard at it.
I would say perhaps we are a little bit ahead of what we would have thought when we put the plan together.
So we are building on that and it’s something that we are going to continue to build on during the year and certainly as we roll into 2015.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Good morning.
Maybe just a quick one here for Miles and one for Tom.
Miles I think for most investors they view this first quarter as certainly the most challenging quarter of the year and yet margin and earnings were certainly better than expected? So I wonder from here could you help us understand the margin story and momentum from here? And then related your confidence in Nutritional margin is clear but should we be thinking about opportunities at Abbott on a segment basis on a corporate cost basis or both? Okay.
Yeah.
Let me back up to the bigger context of the year and the quarter.
As you know because of something that happened in the second half of last year we have got an optical challenge here more optical than operational really because Nutrition recall we had in the second half of the year was significant.
Exchange went disproportionately against us in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.
There is a bunch of comparative things I can tell you.
But at the end of the day it makes for a tale of two halves and when you are lapping the impact of those it makes this first half look depressed than the second half look like a huge ramp and the truth is neither is true.
And it’s really a comparison issue in a lot of cases.
I would love to say gee but for these things the growth rate this quarter would look like X.
But the fact is that’s the truth.
And so the first half of the year looks one way the second half looks another.
And I would recall I’d say first of all I’d remind you when we gave our guidance we gave double-digit guidance which we’ve done every year for last seven years I think.
And we come into the year knowing the first half doesn’t do that but the second half then looks like this big ramp and the optics to that have -- some people say gee can you really get there and I say well yeah it’s really more comparison than anything else.
The underlying fundamentals of everything I’m looking at looks solid to me.
I don’t see any trends or anything that are concerning me yet.
Now that said I’m not a forecaster of exchange and last year exchange went the wrong way in the second half and not sure I could have forecasted it to the degree that it happened.
But and I certainly couldn’t have forecasted the recall.
But in any case one of the challenges is that that quarter-to-quarter look because you’ve got to constantly remind investors about the elements that are affecting the oddness of this comparison.
And I’d say the first half is trending better than I expected.
We do have a number of cost and expense initiatives and I would say they are focused partly because of the separation with AbbVie and partly focused on just greater efficiency and the shaping of our business.
And they happened to be a lot of the same areas.
So as you work through the separation of back office things and so forth would that be it’s the opportunity to kind of get things resized reshaped located in the right places and so on.
That’s all going pretty well.
And there is a lot of initiatives that way inside the company that are coming along.
So as Tom I think pointed out the beat here the $0.06 beat is partly timing because -- and I’m happy about that because otherwise that optical comparison of the first half and second half does look pretty dramatic and there is a timing issue in this.
Part of it’s in R&amp;D.
Part of it’s in SG&amp;A et cetera.
But at least the optics look a little better.
And part of it is not timing part of it’s real.
And I know at some point somebody is going to ask me here gee why didn’t you raise guidance and I’m waiting to see if we get to that and I’m sure Mike’s going to ask me pretty soon.
I will explain when I get there.
But the point is there is a lot of opportunity here in real cost.
We’ve seen a lot of improvement in our gross margins.
First of all above the discretionary spending line but I think most of you realize whether it’s been price pressure in Europe or exchange itself that all that benefit of the gross margin improvements has largely offset what otherwise would have been deteriorating margin because of exchange or pricing et cetera and we haven’t deteriorated.
In fact we’ve improved gross margin anyway.
Then on top of that -- and I think there's still quite a bit of opportunity there for us and we are well planned in going after it.
On the other hand then in expense there is good spending and they are spending that you would rather not spend too much on.
And in a lot of our G&amp;A categories I think there's opportunity for us to spend less and be more efficient then that’s real money too.
And some of that will improve margins at the bottom line and some of it will allow us to spend more either in SG&amp;A or R&amp;D.
But the fact is our SG&amp;A spending I think is pretty healthy as it is.
We are up 31% 32% something like.
We are at 31% or 32% as a percent of the P&amp;L.
And it’s a pretty healthy spend.
Now could you spend more? I’ve never asked the general manager yet that if they needed money would they take it to spend more and of course they would all take it and spend more.
But I think we’ve got healthy spending.
I think the P&amp;L is healthy.
I think that the balance is right.
We’ve got opportunity to improve spending and improve gross margin.
And as we work through the things we're doing to improve our topline growth and our share gain and our expansion in the number of markets I think it’s good for investors that they can count on a certain amount of margin expansion and profit growth while we wait for the topline and the economies and other things to improve.
So I hope that answered your question.
All right.
Thanks Miles.
And I think one additional question for Tom here.
I think I may have missed in the commentary Tom.
But historically when you do a buyback your buybacks were heavier in the first half than the second half.
Can you just talk about the pace of the buyback in the first half of the year how active you were in the first quarter and should we expect a historical Abbott practice of buybacks to occur here again in ’14? Thank you.
Yeah.
Well as you saw in the release our average shares were about $19 million below the prior year which was about 1% below.
We were pretty aggressive in the first quarter on the share buyback and I think David your comment is pretty accurate.
We are pretty much through the vast majority of what we’re going to do in that area.
We like the price of the stock and we felt that it was a good time to execute.
So we’re down about 1% on average in the quarter.
But as you know that improves after the first quarter because we bought throughout that period and the second and third and fourth quarters will benefit even more from the share buyback.
So you’re right the vast majority of it was done in the quarter.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Thank you for taking the questions.
And Miles I’m not going to ask why you didn’t raise guidance.
So I’m sorry I will stay that for someone else.
Let me focus on the International Nutrition business because if our math is right if we back up the 75 million from Fonterra and you back out FX you still got a business that’s only up by 4.5% which is kind of well below that it was growing prior to Fonterra.
So can you spend a minute on that? So we’re not getting impacting on it that from backing out the 75 million from Fonterra and International Pediatric Nutrition is kind of 4.5% there.
Yes.
I’m going to let Brian answer as he is dying to answer that for you go ahead.
Thanks Miles.
So Mike yes I’d say math I mean you get about 4%.
I think you need to go back to Q1 and look at what we had said in Q1 last year in our Pediatric International Nutrition business.
I think we grew somewhere around 21% and historically we have been saying more think of this business kind of sustainably performing in the mid-teens.
So we’re up against the comparison last year which is worldwide.
We launched a lot across our dollars portfolio and adjusting for that it puts you more back up into to the double digits.
So as we move forward we are in a good position.
We continue to recover in China so we are seeing the recovery there.
You see where we just launched a new product if you will.
They will help us to further compete as we segment the premium market over there.
There is opportunities for there for us with our new product that I mentioned with Eleva and even more opportunity to come here as we open our plant in the second quarter which will also provide further capabilities there as well and will also bolster our return back to our historical growth rates there.
But basically when you look at the first quarter you do have a comparable that you’re facing in Q1 where we’re launching a lot of tolerance across the portfolio.
Mike I would add to that.
And I keep answering questions this way this is not a business it’s also smooth quarter to quarter even though you think it should be.
And so sometimes the comparisons are choppy in the past when we had the pharma business with us so much attention was paid to pharma and HUMIRA and other things that people didn’t really notice the choppiness of the nutrition business and factors like what Brian just highlighted had made a difference from time to time.
I would say that there a couple of things are clear.
The economy has definitely pressured the business some particularly the U.S.
and I think in emerging markets as well.
I think we see that slower underlying market rates like everybody else does and yet that emerging market rate is still much higher than developed markets but we’ve seen that pressure.
I note that a lot of companies have pointed at the harsh winter in the U.S.
and so what I don’t know whether winter affected us or not.
I suppose it stands to reason that it could have in the U.S.
And internationally the single biggest thing as you know that has affected us has been this recall and lapping it because it affected more than one country.
But that said if you ask me am I satisfied with the growth rates in some of these countries anyway? The answer will clearly be no.
So I think there is more potential to do better I do.
And I think we are making the right investments and the right changes and so forth to address that.
A lot of our attention is currently being paid to the countries that were impacted by the recall.
And I would say the teams are doing a really great job in terms of the recovery given the dynamics of the infant formula market.
We still got tremendous opportunity there and we are investing to secure that opportunity.
We got tremendous opportunity in the adult nutrition in some markets where we are not present and China always is a big opportunity that way.
So I’m not discouraged I think at all I’m never very satisfied but I am discouraged.
I think that sometimes this business looks like 20% in the quarter and sometimes it looks like 10% or 12% or 8% or 9% or whatever and it does kind of roll in humps.
But underlying I think it’s still very robust and strong market all of us would benefit from little tailwind of economy but you never take that for granted.
Okay.
Let me couple of quick follow-up.
So one I wanted to ask just on the adult nutritional business in the U.S.
Paragon announced in the quarter that they will enter that market with a store brand Ensure and you dominate that market with Ensure you have about 70% share.
Can you just talk about how you view the competitive landscape and agree to which we should be watching how this plays out with Paragon being a real competitive potentially coming in? And then just lastly Tom can you just spent a minute on the timing issue expenses they thought that it was so different than your guidance in January caught us all off-guard? So what surprised you that the expenses didn't occur this quarter that they slipped into later parts of the year? Thanks.
Well let me comment on the decision first.
First of all I would say Paragon is a fine competitors and I admire a lot of accomplishment Paragon had in the market that they serve.
That said we've had private label competition for Ensure for sometime in the Wal-Mart which is one of our biggest distribution outlets has its own private label to compete with Ensure.
So that's not new for us.
And we've already had that kind of competition in these categories for a year so whether a new entrant in the category makes a difference or not is I guess to be seen it's not a new thing.
Our share position with Ensure hasn't been impacted significantly by the existence of the private label competition that’s already there and I think it's in the mass outlets that you would expect we have the greatest impact.
So I would never like to predict how a fine competitor is going to do but I think we're in a very strong position with our brand and our product in the way our customers view it.
And now let Tom address your expense question.
Yeah.
Mike it was really interesting in the quarter usually the challenges is getting sales forecast accurate and as I indicated in my remarks we were incredibly accurate on our sales forecast and right on track.
Usually in the spending areas when you look across our businesses and across the functional areas everyone forecast the rate of spending and usually when you look at the actual there are few puts and takes and you're usually pretty close to your forecast which is very unusual this quarter that virtually every unit was under spending in the same direction and when we worked with them and talk to them about their plans and initiatives and the importance of that spending relative to achieving commercial objectives in the businesses and in terms of some of the project work in some of the other areas it was still very critical that we continue to invest in those programs despite the fact that we didn't forecast to spending as accurately as we should.
So I think to your question historically we've been very good at forecasting this so it was just a very unusual quarter and everything just kind of move the same direction and really this is spending we should be doing.
We've got lots of good opportunities.
And I'm just talking about the timing piece of this from my remarks.
We've tons of opportunities in the new product areas and the things that we should be investing the business and will be investing over the next three quarters.
Mike I'd say from my part I was also caught a little off-guard by being ahead so far in the quarter.
And we have looked at it how much of it is real timing and how much of it is real? And I think the fact to the matter is we went into the year with the double-digit target our original guidance was double-digit.
We did not constrain SG&amp;A R&amp;D spending in the settling of those targets relative to the goals we have the new product launches the expansion opportunities and so forth.
And frankly I'm favorably pleased -- I am pleased that we are ahead on a number other things that we wanted to do.
I think even though you didn't ask me I want to see another quarter play to see what those underlying trends are.
I still think it's early in the year to be making adjustments to expectations.
But frankly it's possible.
I think at the end of the second quarter we will have a pretty good feel for how things are trending for the year and into the second half.
I don't really have any desire to constrain spending but I don't have any desire to constrain what the bottom-line does either I mean if even though we forecast that arrange to give us 10% growth at the midpoint of the range that's actually low for us in terms of double-digit growth over the last seven years.
We’ve been higher than that in our overall growth in the last seven years every year.
So I think there is a pretty good chance some of this is sustainable.
I think we’ll see another quarter played in if we get a little boost from gradually improving economy and so forth.
I feel pretty good about the second half.
I feel pretty good about the profiles of the businesses.
I feel good about our spending capacity.
I would like to spend more but I know that’s always a trade-off with investors you like to participate to.
So I think that’s possible in both directions.
And I’m pleased that we can balance this timing a bit but I’m also pleased that I think we’re ahead.
I’d just like to see how ahead we are and what kind of sustainable basis and make sure that we are robustly funding everything we want to do.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Hi thanks for taking my question.
So just on the non-cost phasing part of the EPS beat.
So can you just give us a bit more color on which division about $40 million of the non-phase part of the SG&amp;A was just which division that was probably being focused on? And then you keep reiterating the original mid-term guidance in 2015 for nutrition of more than 20% but that could lead investors generally think that once you get above 20% for that division that’s kind of your ceiling on margins.
When do you think you will be able to update the market on what more of a real long run rate of margin performance could be in that business? Thank you.
I never give forecast out through the following year and I don’t constraint margin when I look at.
I mean actually I’d say interestingly it’s a rare debate that you think you got too much margin or too much margin growth.
I think it’s a fair call.
There is our diagnostics business for example as you probably aware has enjoyed great improvement in gross margin over the last several years and that drops through to the bottom line in operating margin and so forth.
And there’s kind of a point where you would say okay it’s making enough money let’s make sure we’re spending enough in SG&amp;A and R&amp;D which we are.
And they’re in a fairly heavy investment phase in R&amp;D because they’ve got multiple systems in development all of which remain on track and timing and so forth.
And I think it’s somewhat unprecedented that way.
But at some point you say look we can make something too profitable I haven’t had that problem.
Although I think as we’ve noted in the improvements in diagnostics over time they’re getting up there to first best-in-class profitability in that business.
And I think nutrition has a way to go.
There’s still an opportunity there.
It doesn’t constraint spending there is no limit.
I mean we’re not operating against some limit now would I forecast one for you because I don’t have one.
So I would say we’re always kind of a relentlessly pushing forward in the improvement of the profiles of the business.
We want to be efficient users of assets and expenses.
And while there is opportunity for margin expansion there is also no substitute for top-line growth and you’ve got to investigate that top-line growth so we got to find that balance.
Tom there was a question there about the mix in the division.
Jeff it’s kind of the same of the answer I provided to Mike.
I mean it’s pretty much across the board relatively small amounts across the various divisions but we added it all up.
It’s just turned out to be a fair amount of timing in the quarter.
So no one division really stands out.
And now sort of quick follow-up on EPD if I can.
Just could we expect some sort of restocking that business in Q2 with the plant manufacturing coming back on board again? Probably.
Yeah Brian.
Thanks Miles.
Yes I think Jeff to think about that over the Q2 Q3 timeframe as the way this works is you had inventory with the distributors those distributors will be working off inventory to meet the end consumers demand.
And likewise then we would be coming back and just working with our distributors to restore them to their ongoing normal inventory levels here in established pharma.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen.
Hi thanks for taking the question.
Just first just a follow-up on the EPD business understanding that the reacceleration of the back half is going to be pushed by continued mix shift towards emerging markets.
Can you talk this and give us an update about some of those new SKUs or new products that you’re getting registrations in in new countries that you’re entering into and where we’re in terms of those metrics? Yes Josh I’ll kick this off and let Tom or Miles add more color.
Really this business is more going to be about our portfolios that we are building not really one SKU matters but I would say the team is making progress as it evaluates where it wants to be strong for example in women’s health or in gastroenterology in spaces like this where they have a very rigorous first to go looking where there is might be gaps in the portfolio that they can easily augment or going through LNA.
So there is a lot of activity going on there.
I would expect as part of the acceleration in the second half we will continue to see a strong growth in India.
We mentioned Brazil earlier.
India has returned to I guess a more healthy market growth versus what the market saw last year recall last year we saw this market slow as it implemented what we call this drug pricing control order which cause a little bit of channel disruption if you will.
We are coming out of that.
We are seeing the market return to nice growth rates.
Our growth rate is well.
So that sets us up as well for some acceleration as we move through the second half in one of our largest -- our largest country if you will in the established pharmaceutical business.
Hey Josh.
I would add to that on the emerging market side in particular in this business there are 14 countries or so that we put extra emphasis on and focus on and each has a plan that’s very detailed about the build-out of its key therapeutic categories in that country or that market and the depth or breadth of product line within each therapeutic category and there is a plan there that’s a combination of two things in each country.
First is our internal registrations from our own creation of pipeline or existing products and second is an LNA budget for filling gaps or opportunities that they see in their country.
It’s the one place where we have decentralized the bit of the LNA activity into the hands of the President of that business and his staff so that they can more rapidly go after this smaller say product or product line opportunities that can enhance our position in a lot of these markets.
I can’t give you a lot of detail or background about how that’s going because frankly its dozens and dozens of products and opportunities in countries and so forth.
But it’s pretty comprehensive pretty detailed and it’s tracked very closely by them and it’s getting a lot of attention and you build it out a little bit of a time.
This is not a business of blockbusters although ironically the product for which we shutdown the plant for expansion here in the first quarter it’s a significant product for EPD a very significant product which is why we needed the plant expansion.
And I figure if we are going to have a plant expansion or suppress a quarter this is the one to do it when we knew it is going to be a tough comparison anyway.
So it’s going to get that out of way.
We have got some products like that that are fairly big sellers but generally this is the base hit business a lot of base hits and so everyone of these countries has a got plan around whole portfolio base hits to enhance this business and we are going out a lot more in the product maybe we did it first.
Thank you.
And just one follow-up on the devices unit just specifically in diabetes with the headwinds that you are facing here in the U.S.
market you’ve committed on next-generations sensing technology platform? But what other strategic initiatives can you put into play to help with the risk the competitive bidding could continue and pricing could continue to be headwind in the out years what are the strategic initiatives can you manufacture to support the diabetes unit? Thanks a lot.
Well I would say this is one unit I am actually I am very excited about I am studying about the innovation coming here.
I think that our team there did a wonderful job segmenting this market in a way that minimized the damage we took from competitive bidding.
We took hit just like everybody else did.
But I think to a lesser degree because I think we focused on segments that frankly we are more profitable and less vulnerable in a way than what the overall targeted competitive bidding was.
Now that said I think we play great defense and what is more challenge market right now.
But going forward innovation that’s coming here which we will launch in Europe late this summer is pretty significant and I think a pretty unique product that I expect will be very well-received by diabetic patients.
And it hasn’t had a lot of visibility yet.
It will in the coming months.
We keep referring to what is next-generation.
But frankly it’s quite a creative product.
And I think that I think it’s going to have a lot of impact on the business.
I have got great hopes for this.
And I think that the diabetic community in particular both physicians and patients are going to think it’s a terrific product.
So I have got some great expectations for that and I think that as that mode of testing progresses over time this is going to be a fairly good business pretty good business for us.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
Good morning.
Thanks for taking the question.
Let me start off with M&amp;A Miles you made some penalizing comments earlier I think in response to David Roman’s question.
Could you talk a little bit about whether you focus is on technology versus geographic expansion large versus small deals? And then I had a follow-up.
Thanks.
Yes Larry I am afraid all I call tell you is yes.
Yes the answer to that is yes.
It’s geographic it’s -- I don’t know where you define big I mean… Can you hear me? Almost all of this some people would consider small and we might consider big I mean in the context of this company has seen.
Some of this is really significant to us.
And what we’re looking at is nicely enhancing to our businesses and our positions.
Nothing has ever done till it’s done.
So I think it’s dangerous to forecast anything in particular but at least like what’s on the menu and like what I see hear in a few places and it’s across a couple of our sectors.
There is -- if you’re looking for deals today I think it’s a difficult deal market because in some cases valuations are very high or there is not great quality in the assets in some cases.
It’s -- I think we’ve said this several years for the last 15 I mean I think the deal gets a little tougher over year.
And yet we’re looking in the places that can really enhance our positions our businesses and so forth.
We’ve always had a pretty difficult or tough hurdle for the quality of deals.
We’ve had a fairly good track record that way.
And I like what’s on the menu right now.
We will just have to see how plays out.
What I am cautious about it’s hard to forecast until something is done.
But if I tell you there is nothing on my menu then there is nothing on my menu.
And now I can’t tell you that I can’t tell you there is nothing on my menu.
So I don’t want to surprise you by telling there is nothing on the menu and next week I certainly had a great idea or great possibility and it won’t -- it's not going be next week.
But I would say couple of things coming here that would be nice additions to the business I guess that’s about all I can tell you.
That’s very helpful.
And then just as my follow-up the nutrition on mid single digit growth in the second quarter is there pretty big improvement from what we saw this quarter I think in the down 1.7%? So can you talk or give us a little more color where you expect those improvements to come from just because that’s a big part of what will drive acceleration from this quarter in the overall business? And just lastly the added emerging growth rate this quarter you’ve given us that in the past can you give that to us this quarter? Thanks.
Let me start with the first one and then I will come back to nutrition.
With respect to the emerging markets overall if you take the couple buck for adjustments that we talk about in my scripts that refers to the plant capacity expansion affecting our Established Pharmaceuticals as well as where we’re at with respect to our recovery it puts you closer in the 8% to 9% operational growth worldwide in the emerging market growth.
So still very solid growth Larry.
Coming back to nutrition I will go back to my first comment that remember Q1 first of all we did have a lot of launches in Q1 of ’13 that made for a little bit more difficult comparison as I was taking to Mike there.
But secondly our recovery is going well in China and Vietnam.
And so as we move through time and we look at our ramp there where we’re gaining share back in the markets we would expect that impact to moderate as we move into quarter two that will have a significant impact on our step-up.
The other thing I would add is as we saw overall in the United States we saw a retail environment that was quite slow I think not only did the companies who serve retailer feel but the retailer themselves felt it.
We have been out there and it’s a great opportunity for us as the category leader as the market leader as Miles mentioned particularly in adult and even in brands like PediaSure to work with our retailers to generate demand for the consumers through some retail activation programs and those are generating some nice early results.
They are marching early into April.
We will continue to watch that but we definitely would expect a step up in the United States.
I will also comment too in the United States that this was the last quarter of our getting through the transition where we were exiting the non-core what I’d call device or tubes and sets business in the United States.
So that also will drive some step-up sequentially as we look at the U.S.
results.
So the combination of those two things Larry the recovery the U.S.
and just continued underlying strong demand in our nutrition business worldwide both pediatric and adult will cause us to move up to chain there as we expect.
Thanks for taking the question.
So [Ella] (ph) we have got -- have time for one -- we're going to one more question here.
Thank you.
Our final question today is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
Hi good morning.
Thanks for taking my question.
My first question for you Miles the back-end acceleration a lot of it is going to be driven by nutritionals and a lot of it's going to be driven by the recovery in China.
And one of the push-backs I get and one of the concerns I've been hearing is the China economy slowing.
And I know Miles you're in China several times a year or so I'm wondering if you could just take a moment and just talk about what you're seeing in the China nutritionals market and how Abbott's positioned there so that some of that concern can be (indiscernible)? I had a follow-up on the U.S.
infant business.
I suppose it's fair to say in a general sense the economy or the market in China has slowed some but they're slowed and then they're slowed.
And China is not a slow market China is not like Europe or the U.S.
or Japan or developed markets it's by comparison a robustly growing market.
The fact that it’s not growing double digits may disappoint some people but I think the high single-digit growth rates in the Chinese economy are pretty attractive and then our business opportunity on top of that pretty attractive.
And I suppose it depends on which competitors you ask and how damaged we were by the recall or the dynamics that changed in the market or whatever.
I see the market that's worthy of a significant investment and great opportunity and we are gaining our share back.
Growth rate is good very good.
I think if I expand that to the second half of the year the reality here of our business is we just have the quarter that we didn't want to have but had to have as a transition in the year because the optics and the comparison and so forth.
Next quarter gets better and it’s still part of that first half but I'd say the second quarter is a transitional quarter for us and second half of the year is pretty robust.
There is nothing heroic that has to take place for that second half of our year to be robust.
We are well ahead on our own margin initiatives haven't seen any significant speed bumps around the sales growth rates or the fundamentals of the market.
We just have the quarter we forecasted and we're ahead.
In my mind we're well ahead of where we wanted to be and we are well ahead going into Q2 and I think we're going to be well ahead going into Q3 and Q4.
When we set our guidance at the beginning of the year that dramatic difference between the first half of the year and the second half of the year had a number of people cautious about the second half of the year just like you just said.
And I thought if we raised guidance here in the first quarter and raised the second half of the year even more nobody's going to particularly think that that's credible because they're already cautious.
Well I am not cautious I know what we're going to do I'm pretty confident other than things I can’t predict and nobody can.
I'm pretty confident about our performance and I think we'll wait and see how the second quarter goes but I think the second quarter is a transitional one to robust second half that then takes us a strongly into ’15.
And I think the underlying fundamentals of our primary geographies around the world are improving people may be looking at China and say gee it's declined.
I think that already happened.
And at this point particularly given the business we're in we're not mining we're not in other things where you can say wow it really slowed.
We're in a segment that frankly isn't slowing and it's just as robust it's been.
And I think it's a terrific opportunity for us which is why we're going to put a fair amount of investment there not only in China but in the number of markets around the world.
And the birth rate should increase next year and the years after is that correct? Well I don't know.
I suppose so I'm not counting on birth rates I don't even get that macroeconomic about it.
We're looking at it.
Frankly I'm not even counting on just a tailwind of market growth I want share gain and I'm targeting share gain from competitors and share presence in that market in a lot of these markets.
We are measuring ourselves on share.
And that translates as you might guess into fairly healthy growth but you can fill yourself with healthy growth when it’s the market.
I want share gains.
And so that on top of whatever the market may give us in terms of birth rate and so forth I think we’ve got a very long-term market in China that’s a very healthy robust market.
And I think we had an unfortunate setback last year that it was nobody’s intention to have it happen.
It certainly wasn’t our partners’ intention to have it happen but it did.
And we’ve had great cooperation from Fonterra in resolving what happened there and they remain an incredibly important partner to us and a valuable partner to us.
And I’d just say look the two of us as companies have some great plans and thoughts for China and other market.
It’s an important one for us and we remain very committed to it because I think that all the growth that we forecasted in the past is there.
One of the things I always caution investors about we get so obsessed about our quarter in the United States because that’s how we are.
We are quarterly driven CNBC driven economy.
And our investments and progress in some of these markets you can’t measure in quarters.
I know we need the feedback every quarter but to know that everything is okay and everything is on track and so forth then I would say everything is okay and everything is on track.
I expect speed bumps out of the emerging markets.
I don’t expect not to have them.
I mean who could forecast that you will have issues with Russia and Ukraine and so forth that who could forecast as you would have devaluations in given countries.
You can’t forecast some of that stuff.
There is always going to be that.
But the long-term fundamentals of investing in a lot of these countries in their healthcare systems and their need for the products that we make are strong and that’s where we are going.
It may be bumpy from quarter-to-quarter.
It’s particularly bumpy this time in the first and second quarters because of this recall we had last year which was significant and the adjustment and exchange in the second half.
But the long-term fundamentals of these markets are very strong and we’ve been careful to select geographies where we know those fundamentals remain sustainable and frankly I’m pretty upbeat about the rest of this year even the second quarter.
I think there is great opportunity here and I see nothing but upward ramp probably with some speed bumps to be unpredictable but nevertheless pretty strong year ahead of us.
And I’m glad we’ve got a head start on it.
We are well ahead in this quarter.
I’m not ready to change our guidance because I want to see another quarter play it because it’s a transitional quarter for us.
But second quarter call should be an interesting call.
That’s helpful.
Can I just ask also in the U.S.
infant business? As that business came in softer and I think Brian on the call mentioned a little bit of weather but is there anything else going on underlying in the U.S.
infant business? Share is very stable.
Our shares are strong very stable.
I have a hard time blaming weather on this one because babies got to eat.
I can’t -- I just cannot come up with a weather reason for that.
I think the U.S.
market has always been pressured the pediatric market.
We haven’t lost share.
So I have to say it’s probably economy phenomenon to some degree.
We are not losing share to private-label or anything else.
We are not losing share.
So I don’t know if there is much more fundamental I can say about it other than I think the underlying fundamentals are good and it was lesser quarter than we might have liked.
But I don’t think it presages some long-term direction.
Yeah.
Glenn I’d just clarify in Brian’s remarks.
He was referring more to the adult segment which as you know as to Mile’s point infant is less discretionary and the adult segment is little more discretionary and while overall there was a modest impact on the company in the quarter that’s the one area where we saw little bit.
Yeah.
I think it’s a fair comment.
The adult is more discretionary.
But look the bottom line is the quarter was forecasted to be a very low growth quarter.
Well we met expectations.
It was a low growth quarter on the topline.
It didn’t miss our expectations.
It is what we expected.
It ins and outs are a little different but you could sit here and say there is a whole list of things comparisons and other things that make it a low growth quarter.
All right.
Some of that is pretty significant and true but at the end of the day it was a low growth quarter.
I don’t expect that to be some sustainable growth rate.
I think this gets constantly better over time and I’m glad to be ahead.
Okay.
Great.
Thanks for the color.
Thanks Larry.
Okay.
Thank you [Ella] (ph).

I would now like to introduce Mr.
Brian Yoor Vice President Investor Relations.
Okay good morning and thank you for joining us.
Joining me today on the call will be Miles White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman Executive Vice President – Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail.
Following our comments Miles Tom and I will take your questions.
Before we get started some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the expected financial results for 2014.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1(a) Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2013.
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.
Note that any sales or earnings per share guidance provided today on the call will continue to include the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business in our forecasts.
Tom will discuss in more detail how we expect to report the results of this big business beginning with the third quarter.
In today’s conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott’s ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings new release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Okay thanks Brian.
Good morning.
This morning we reported second quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.54 above our guidance range and representing growth of 17%.
As expected sales increased 3% on an operational basis.
This was a sequential improvement from the first quarter and we are on track to accelerate sales growth in the second half of the year.
We are ahead of our expectations through the first half of this year and we are raising our full-year 2014 ongoing earnings per share guidance to $2.19 to $2.29 from $2.16 to $2.26.
At the same time we’re actively shaping Abbott for durable long-term growth.
Part of our growth strategy is to build critical mass and leadership positions in key emerging geographies across our diverse portfolio.
In diagnostics we were early to establish our presence in the geographies of China Russia and Brazil.
In devices we have significant opportunity in the cataract lens and diabetes markets given demographic trends as well as in our vascular business with innovative devices such as Absorb.
In established pharmaceuticals and nutrition where we already have large and growing businesses in emerging geographies we’ve taken a series of steps over the last few months to further shape these businesses for the long term.
As I discussed on our conference call on Monday in our branded generics pharmaceuticals business the recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia as well as the sale of our developed markets business to Mylan accelerate our strategic intent to drive balanced and sustainable growth in emerging geographies.
The net proceeds from the sales of Mylan’s shares over time provide us with a number of choices and possibilities to pursue opportunities that continue to build Abbott for higher growth.
Following the close of these transactions our established pharmaceuticals business will operate entirely in emerging geographies where the growth of branded generics are driven by favorable demographics including growing healthcare systems and a customer base that largely pays out of pocket for high quality trusted brands.
Abbott will hold leading positions in many of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world including India Russia and Latin America.
In nutrition we’re similarly building this business for sustainable growth by continuing to invest in our global infrastructure including our supply chain.
Last week we announced a strategic alliance with Fonterra to develop a diary farm hub in China to invest locally in China’s milk supply.
Fonterra is the world’s largest dairy cooperative and has been a supplier to Abbott for many years.
This strategic alliance leverages Fonterra’s expertise in dairy nutrition and farming and Abbott’s continued commitment to business development in China to ultimately help meet the growing demand for high quality dairy ingredients in China.
This strategic alliance is the latest in a series of investments we’ve made to build our local presence and capabilities in China over the last decade which includes our R&amp;D center in Shanghai and the opening last month of our nutrition manufacturing plant in Jiaxing.
A stronger footprint in country will allow us to be closer to our customers and work faster to create and customize new products for their needs.
Our new plant is one of the most technologically advanced nutrition plants in the world and will manufacture high quality nutrition products for Chinese consumers including a new infant formula brand that we’re launching now called Similac Chintea (ph).
This new product launch is one of several in both our adult and pediatric nutrition businesses across numerous geographies this year.
The transactions we’ve announced over the last several weeks proactively build and shape Abbott in emerging geographies.
At the same time we’re executing on the substantial organic growth opportunities across our company.
I’ll briefly review our second quarter results and I’ll start with nutrition where we anticipate returning to double-digit sales growth in the second half of this year as this business anniversaries or laps the sales disruption in international nutrition and launches new products.
Our innovations bring advanced nutrition to meet the needs of our customers drive share expansion and grow the market.
We’ll open three new manufacturing facilities in total this year to support the strong global near and long-term demand for adult and pediatric nutrition.
Two weeks following the launch of our China plant we opened our new state-of-the-art aseptic liquid plant in Ohio and we expect to open our manufacturing operations in India in the second half of this year.
In diagnostics sales growth was driven by continued above-market performance in core laboratory diagnostics including double-digit growth in the U.S.
We’re funding investments in growth and advancing multiple new system platforms across core laboratory molecular and point of care that will launch over the next few years.
In medical devices we continued to launch differentiated new products to capture share.
In vascular we’re continuing to see market adoption of our breakthrough structural heart technology MitraClip as well as our new peripheral stent Supera.
Both our structural heart and endovascular businesses increased double digits globally this quarter and in our drug eluting portfolio we’re driving increased penetration of Absorb in Europe and several key emerging geographies as we work to bring it to the U.S.
Japan and China which represent more than 50% of the world’s coronary stent market.
In diabetes care performance was in line with our expectations and we’re on track to receive CE Mark in the second half of this year for our next generation sensing technology called Freestyle Libre.
In vision care above market growth of our cataract lens business drove another quarter of double-digit sales growth.
We expect double-digit sales growth for the full year with continued positive momentum from new products.
In established pharma as we anticipated second quarter operational sales growth improved sequentially versus the first quarter.
In key emerging markets sales increased nearly 10% driven by double-digit growth in India Brazil and China as a result of improved commercial execution and continued expansion of product portfolios in several of our therapeutic areas of focus.
We expect continued momentum in EPD in the second half of this year with improved market growth in India and the benefit of additional plant capacity to meet sales demand for key products.
So in summary we’re ahead of our expectations through the first half and we’re raising our full-year ongoing earnings per share guidance.
We delivered a sequential improvement in sales growth this quarter and continue to expect accelerating sales growth in the second half of this year and we’re actively shaping the company with the shareholder in mind as we build Abbott for long-term growth and healthy cash returns.
I’ll now turn the call over to Tom.
Thanks Miles.
Today we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.54 exceeding our previous guidance range.
Sales for the quarter increased 3% on an operational basis; that is excluding an unfavorable impact of around 1% from foreign exchange.
Reported sales increased approximately 2% in the quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in diagnostics and vision care and improved growth in nutrition and established pharmaceuticals.
Sales growth in emerging markets approached 8% on an operational basis in the quarter.
Excluding the estimated impact from the previously reported sales disruption in our nutrition business last year sales in emerging markets increased closer to 10% in the quarter.
The second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.3% of sales ahead of our previous guidance due to continued underlying improvement in diagnostics and better vascular gross margin as a result of the resolution of an intellectual property matter that lowered product costs this quarter and will continue to benefit this business going forward.
In the quarter ongoing R&amp;D investment was 6% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A expense was 30.5% of sales in line with previous expectations.
Before I review our financial outlook I’d like to explain how we expect to report the results of our developed markets branded generics business going forward.
As you know we announced on Monday an agreement to sell this business to Mylan; therefore beginning in the third quarter of this year the sales and earnings from this business are expected to be reported as discontinued operations in our income statement.
However guidance for the third quarter and the full year 2014 that we provide today will continue to include this business in our forecasts.
For the third quarter call we will reconcile the combined results on both a GAAP and adjusted basis to the guidance we’re providing today.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014 today we’re raising our ongoing earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.29 which reflects double-digit growth over 2013 at the midpoint of the range.
We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2014.
Based on current exchange rates we expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 1% on our full year reported sales.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2014.
Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.
We continue to forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% for the full year.
We forecast ongoing R&amp;D somewhat above 6% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A expense of around 29.5% of sales supported by our continuing efforts to manage G&amp;A expenses.
Overall we now project our full-year adjusted operating margin ratio to expand by approximately 100 basis points in 2014 above our previous guidance of 60 basis points of expansion.
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2014 we’re providing for the first time we’re forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61.
We forecast both operational and reported sales growth in the mid-single digits reflecting a neutral impact of foreign exchange on sales in the third quarter based on current exchange rates.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% of sales in the third quarter.
We also forecast ongoing R&amp;D around 6% of sales and ongoing SG&amp;A expense of approximately 29% of sales in the third quarter.
I’d note that in 2013 we experienced a below trend tax rate in the third quarter while in 2014 we expect the ongoing tax rate to again be around 19%.
We project specified items of $0.27 in the third quarter reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release.
This forecast excludes specified items to be provided at a future date related to recently announced transactions.
So in summary second quarter sales growth improved sequentially over the first quarter of 2014.
We’re on track with our expectations for accelerated growth in the second half of the year and we’re raising our full-year ongoing earnings per share guidance.
With that I’ll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook.
Brian? Thank you Tom.
This morning I will review our second quarter 2014 performance and third quarter sales outlook by business.
As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I’ll first discuss our nutrition business where global sales increased 3% in the second quarter a sequential improvement versus the first quarter and on track for second half acceleration as we anniversary the August 2013 sales disruption in our international pediatric nutrition business.
In our international pediatric nutrition business we’re on track to return to double-digit sales growth in the second half of this year as we continue to recapture share in the affected markets and launch new products across several new segments and geographies.
This includes Similac Chintea a new infant formula we are currently launching into China.
It’s the first product to be manufactured in our new China facility and is available in our innovative reclosable packaging.
In addition to further enhance our competitiveness and capture share in the Chinese infant formula market Abbott launched a new infant formula Elova (ph) in the second quarter and Similar Simple Pack late last year in the online segment of the market.
Sales of international pediatric nutrition increased modestly in the second quarter impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year comparison created by the previously reported 2013 sales disruption.
The impact of this event continues to decline as we recapture share and is estimated to have reduced international pediatric sales in the quarter by approximately $40 million or 7 percentage points.
We also experienced some recent government-initiated pricing changes in Vietnam and Saudi Arabia which we’re managing.
International adult sales increased 10% in the quarter driven by strong growth of our Ensure brand and double-digit growth in the emerging markets.
This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of high single to double-digit sales growth in this business.
Abbott continues to shape and grow its priority adult nutrition market as it launches several new products this year including the recent launch of a new adult brand Enevo in Japan our largest adult nutrition market outside the U.S.
Enevo is a next generation follow-on product to our market leading Ensure brand.
In the U.S.
nutrition sales increased low single digits in the quarter driven by pediatric nutrition as Abbott remains the market leader in the non-WIC segment of the U.S.
infant formula market.
As we move into the second half of the year we expect global nutrition sales to return to double-digit growth on an operational basis as this business laps the international pediatric sales disruption and executes on its strategic priorities including launching new products opening a new manufacturing facility in India and expanding its full-year operating margin.
In our diagnostics business sales increased 5.5% in the quarter including double-digit growth in emerging markets.
Core laboratory diagnostic sales increased 7% as this business continues to deliver above-market performance in both developed and emerging markets.
U.S.
sales increased 11% as we continued to build momentum with our enterprise account commercial model to capture significant contract wins as customers select Abbott to increase their operational efficiencies.
We’re also broadening and differentiating our Architect Assay menu and launched a new diabetes test in the U.S.
in April to address the growing prevalence of diabetes.
International sales increased 6% in the quarter driven by continued growth in emerging markets.
In molecular diagnostics worldwide sales were impacted by the timing of tenders in our infectious disease business in several emerging markets.
We expect improved growth in our molecular business going forward with a favorable impact from the timing of expected tender wins in the second half of this year.
In point of care diagnostics worldwide sales increased 4% representing a sequential improvement from the first quarter as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted European and emerging markets and as the U.S.
market continues to stabilize.
For the third quarter in global diagnostics we are forecasting mid to high single digit operational sales growth.
In medical devices vascular sales increased low single digits in the quarter in line with our expectations.
International vascular sales increased 3.5% driven by double-digit sales growth of MitraClip and endovascular products which includes our new peripheral stent Supera for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery or SFA.
In the second half of this year we expect new products to continue to drive share expansion and sales growth including Supera MitraClip and Absorb.
At the same time we continue to make good progress to bring Absorb to the U.S.
China and Japan markets over the next few years.
Data presented at international medical meetings continues to reinforce strong clinical results for Absorb in a broad range of patients.
In the second half of this year we expect to present one-year results from our Absorb 2 clinical trial which is the first randomized trial to compare Absorb to standard of care.
As we look ahead to the third quarter we expect sales in our global vascular business to be relatively flat.
While we expect to continue to show sequential improvement in our base business we’ll also experience a difficult comparison versus the prior year third quarter when we realize the final sales true-up related to a third party agreement.
In diabetes care global sales in the second quarter decreased 10% in line with our expectations.
Outside of the United States diabetes care is focused on driving continued growth and expects to receive European CE Mark for its new Freestyle Libre next generation sensing technology in the second half of this year.
U.S.
sales continue to be impacted by the carryover effect from implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program for Medicare patients in July of last year.
For the third year in our global diabetes business we forecast some moderation in the sales decline and expect a mid to high single-digit decline on an operational basis.
In vision care we achieved 12% sales growth in the second quarter which represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
Sales of our cataract products represent nearly 70% of our vision care business and increased strong double-digits outpacing the growth of the global cataract market driven by market share gains of our recently launched products.
These products include the Tecnis OptiBlu and the Tecnis OptiBlu preloaded lenses in Japan and the Tecnis Toric lenses in the U.S.
and Japan.
In addition the adoption of our new Catalys laser cataract system is exceeding our expectations due to strong customer interest in our technology.
During the second quarter we received European CE Mark for Tecnis Symfony extended range vision intraocular lens.
Tecnis Symfony is a premium lens that provides patients with continuous range of vision including far intermediate and near distances but with reduced incidence of halo and glare.
For the third quarter of 2014 we expect our global vision care business to continue to grow double digits on an operational basis.
Lastly our established pharmaceuticals business or EPB where sales increased more than 2% in the quarter and also demonstrated a sequential improvement versus the first quarter.
Sales in our key emerging markets segment increased nearly 10% driven by double-digit sales growth in India Brazil and China.
Improved market dynamics coupled with commercial execution in India expansion of product portfolios in Brazil and stronger growth in China including the replenishment of a key women’s health product contributed to strong sales growth in the quarter.
Sales in our developed and other market segments decreased 5% in the quarter in line with our expectations.
In the second half of the year we expect further improvement in the sales growth rates of EPB driven by improved market growth coupled with commercial execution in India as well as the benefit from the recent plant capacity expansion to meet demand for certain key products including those belonging to our women’s health portfolio.
For the third quarter of 2014 we continue to forecast sales growth in our established pharmaceuticals business in the low single digits on an operational basis.
So in summary we’ve had a pretty active second quarter executing on several transactions to further shape Abbott for the long term and we’re ahead of expectations through the first half of the year resulting in our raise today of our full-year ongoing EPS guidance.
We will now open the call for questions.
Hi good morning.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Miles I wanted to start with a question on nutritionals.
It’s good to see nutritionals getting back to positive growth.
We tend to focus so much on pediatrics but what caught me by surprise was the strength is adult particularly outside the U.S.
up 10%.
So I’m wondering if you can spend some time talking about adults – is that 10% growth sustainable and how should we be thinking about that growth beyond this quarter and what could be the key drivers? Thanks.
Sure.
You know the direct answer to your question is yes I think it is sustainable.
I mean it might go up a point down a point – who knows? – from time to time but the general direction at that magnitude I think is sustainable.
You know as you know Glenn we are the world leaders in that category in almost every country and there’s still enormous amounts of opportunity out there given the demographics of the world not just in developed countries but also in emerging countries.
There’s a big opportunity for us I think in China in particular and part of our expansion in China will address that over time.
We’ve got a big opportunity to enter that market build that market create it and do in China what we’ve done in a lot of other countries around the world.
So I think there’s still a lot of opportunity.
There’s always room for innovation whether it be in the form—you know we have a product now Clear in the United States that’s not a milk-based product that I think will be popular with consumers and I think that given different flavors different forms different packages and so forth I think there’s a lot of opportunity to expand the market and grow the market where we’ve already got pretty strong share.
That’s an important part of our business.
And you’re right – the pediatric segment tends to get a lot of the attention but I think a lot of the growth and opportunity here remains in the adult segment.
And just as a follow-up if I’m looking at the operating margins for the nutritional business about 20% yet some of your peers are closer to 25%.
Now that you’re at 20% is 25% the next goal? You know something? My management in that business will say if we reach 25 are we done? And I’ll of course say no – 30 would be the next goal and if we reach 30 would 35 be the next goal.
I’m not sure I’m ever going to be satisfied but I’d say this – we’re not done and we’re not stopping.
There’s a lot of things that go into determining what the margin is in the business and in terms of our cost to deliver.
A lot of the moves that we’ve made in the last year with our supply chain globally including some of the things that we’ve done with Fonterra with other suppliers are aimed at lowering our cost to deliver.
Some of the products that we’ve had manufactured by third parties we’ll bring in house and do ourselves.
Part of our plant strategy here with not only our liquid plant in Ohio but our plant expansion in China and India is to do that.
There is obviously large freight savings when you manufacture in key markets as opposed to ship from the U.S.
or Europe or other locations.
So there’s a number of things that go into the overall cost structure and I’d say there’s still plenty of room to improve our margins in this business and the team has been very focused on that.
Some of them take a little longer than others to realize because of structural or infrastructure changes in our whole supply chain system but I’d say there is more room there.
Okay great.
Thank you.
Hi good morning.
Thank you.
Tom I want to spend a minute just on the operating line.
If I look at the first half of the year most of the incremental growth is coming from your work on controlling operating spending.
Even if I adjust for—add back (indiscernible) down low single digits and it looks like for the year the boost in the guidance is a function primarily of your operating spend coming in.
So could you spend some time talking about where those reductions are coming from and how we should think about the trend not just this year but going forward? We’ve talked about this off and on over the last few quarters Mike and when we exited the separation it was clear to the entire organization that our G&amp;A levels in particular were higher than they should have been and we’ve been working very hard to address that through process improvements in the back office basic efficiencies only providing the appropriate services to the businesses.
It’s been kind of a steady progress we’ve made on that – you know every quarter we’re able to change the trend of the run rate and just been steadily chipping away at that.
I wouldn’t say we’re done – we still have a few things we want to do.
We’re getting more efficient in the IT areas and some of the finance and accounting areas and even—especially in the purchasing area where we’ve invested a lot of time and we think can drive savings as well.
So it’s a very broad-based approach I’d say a very steady approach; and to your point it’s really contributed to the flattening of the SG&amp;A.
What we have not been doing is tuning back on productive SG&amp;A – you know things that really drive sales and growth.
We’ve tried very hard to sustain and even increase investment in those areas while we’re tuning back in the other areas.
Okay.
Can I just ask about one of the businesses that has struggled and that’s the diabetes business and the impact of competitive bidding.
Can you spend a little bit more time on the strategy of that business? I think everybody is aware that you’re working on coming out with this novel product in Europe later this year but more broadly than that what’s the plan for the U.S.
business going forward? It is to largely run that business as a meter business and run it for cash and try and just maximize profitability? Mike this is Miles.
I’d say for a transition period that’s probably an accurate comment.
I think that business has done a great job of managing its costs and its expenses and so forth.
We still have a very healthy gross margin in the business and so it’s sort of tale of two businesses and particularly in the U.S.
I’d say that because it remains profitable and cash generating et cetera you’ve got this older legacy circumstance of strategy market channels products et cetera that clearly is under pressure from competitive bidding and what CMS has done.
Then you’ve got very new innovative products that frankly really matter and make a significant difference for patients like Libre which is coming first in Europe.
That we believe will be a significant growth driver for this business here over time and it will come to the U.S.
and it will be a global product just like our core base business.
So you’ve got a transition here of the core base business as we grow the more innovative future product and future forms of that product because while it’s launching as a single product there’s actually a product line coming here.
So I think that will continue to drive the business and have a very different proposition for the patient.
Okay thank you guys.
Hi good morning and thanks for taking the questions.
So first Miles I just wanted to ask about the nutritionals business.
You made some commentary in your prepared remarks about the strategic alliance with Fonterra and also opening up the new manufacturing plant in China as well.
I just wanted to see if you could provide just a little bit more color on how important these two initiatives are in returning pediatric nutritionals to a sustainable higher growth trajectory and can you also talk a little bit more about the ongoing broader strategy in China? One of the questions was on the adult opportunity there too but just hoping to get a little bit more color.
Okay.
First of all I’d say Fonterra has been a partner and a supplier of ours for a very long time and it’s no secret that a year ago they had a recall that impacted us impacted other competitors as well and nobody tried to have a recall nobody tried to have a problem but it set us back for a period in China Saudi Arabia Vietnam some other countries.
Out of our discussions came a number of ideas for the companies going forward.
You can spend your time arguing about something nobody wanted to happen or you can look ahead and say where are our opportunities? The fact is China is an opportunity for us as is the global supply chain in general because as we look at the growth prospects of both the pediatric and adult business worldwide as I said China is not the only growth opportunity.
There’s a lot of countries out there where there is still a lot of opportunity for both companies.
So we very constructively looked at what the companies could do together and out of that came the notion of this dairy hub idea in China which I think and they think will be very important for serving China.
China is a big market and it’s big for pediatric nutrition and it’s big for adult nutrition I think.
I mean I think it will be – it’s not well established at this point but I believe it will be.
One of the key points of this business is you’re a lot more economically able to serve if you are in market or close to market and responding to the desires and the needs of local consumers.
We have R&amp;D in Singapore we have R&amp;D in Shanghai we have manufacturing there.
We are now going to vertically integrate and supply from there in addition to the supplies we take into China and other countries from New Zealand and other milk suppliers in Europe and other places.
So overall we’re looking at this as a comprehensive global network of access to very high quality milk and where we process it and then how we tailor the product to given local markets.
So I think while somebody won’t pay a lot of attention to some of these steps with Fonterra or the plants that we’ve put in place today within a few years we’ll look back and say boy that was really key to do that because now we’re in a very strong position to immediately serve in those markets.
Now further I would tell you – and this is speaking more globally not just specific to China – having our manufacturing in countries helps us in effect self-hedge exchange as currency fluctuates in countries around the world.
It’s clearly a strong commitment to the country which helps us from a regulatory standpoint it helps us from a cost to serve and freight standpoint.
There are a number of things that—you know countries expect today that companies or businesses that are doing business in their country make rooted commitments in those economies and that’s what in effect we’re doing.
I think it will put a very very strong foundation under this nutritional business in a lot of countries around the world.
China obviously is one of the largest right there with the United States in terms of size and potential and therefore a very important one for us to commit to and make the kind of investments we’re making.
Great thanks for that.
And just to follow up the ability of large corporations with breadth and scale a product portfolio being better positioned to partner with hospitals and win contracts and gain share has received a lot of attention – we see this in the medical device industry.
I know you spoke to this on the call on Monday to a degree.
I just wanted to return to your strategic outlook for the medical device division – you know with vascular diabetes and ophtho units.
Is the strategy for the divisions to build breadth and scale there or is that enough to bolster the growth profile of the entire unit or do you need new divisions in medical devices to compete more effectively as the healthcare delivery systems in both developed and emerged markets evolve and just where are your priorities there strategically? Thanks a lot.
Well the first part of your question I’d say the answer is both – not only do we want breadth and scale but I’m open to expansions that are in new areas provided we believe that we can add value or do better than with them than they might stand alone.
So there’s a delicate balance.
There are times—you know when we acquired AMO in the ophthalmology business several years ago a lot of people kind of raised their eyebrows and said gee what do you guys know about ophthalmology? You might say well that was an expansion into a different area – it was one that we had very carefully studied for some years.
It was very intentional and it’s one where we believe the demographics the economics the future of the business is frankly very favorable for us and for that particular segment.
So we made that step to expand and I think that was a good addition for Abbott.
The first couple of years of performance with that business were a little less than anybody really wanted and right now it’s probably the fastest growing division in the company.
So I think that there are times when adding to the company that way will make sense and I think there’s times when clearly if we can broaden our footprint expand our position in a business whether it’s diagnostics or pharmaceuticals or whatever I think that’s to our advantage – I think that’s good.
So we look both ways I guess is the point.
And what was the second half of your question? Did I get that? <br>You did.
Thank you very much.
<br>Okay good.
Hi thanks for taking the question.
I just wanted to clarify – I know you had talked about how you’re going to be reporting going forward for the third quarter with respect to the I guess now discontinued operations so you’re going to report both I guess? And then thinking ahead to 2014 will you have to do anything in terms of the ownership that you’ll have with respect to the Mylan business since it’s going to be a— Well again today the guidance we’ve provided is on a consistent basis with the way we started the year and continued through the first quarter and it’s the combination of both the continuing operations starting in third quarter as well as the discontinued operations of the EPB established developed markets business.
We’ll just very simply show those two pieces and reconcile it back to the guidance provided today and I just think this is cleanest way to bridge to the new reporting.
Obviously for 2015 since we will also be reporting that business as discontinued until it’s actually—the deal closes early in the year we’ll more likely be giving guidance obviously on that basis.
And what was the second part of your question Kristen? I was just wondering if since there will be a 21% ownership interest I guess if I understand it correctly— Yes I mean we’ll be basically carrying this investment at cost and when it’s sold hopefully at gains those gains will be reflected as specified items throughout the period during which we sell it.
Okay perfect.
Then any color just on the performance of the MitraClip program? MitraClip continues to progress nicely.
We had a very good progression in the second quarter.
We still are on track for this product to approach $200 million in sales which would be up 50% over the prior year and we’re getting better coverage in Europe more reimbursement in Europe and we’re making very good progress through the U.S.
reimbursement process and we hope to have some good news on that in the second half of the year.
And then more broadly I guess just on transcatheter valves can you comment on whether you feel like you need a whole portfolio to be more—to more effectively compete within that space? Okay that’s one I probably wouldn’t answer directly for you even if the answer was no.
You know I’ll put this in the context Kristen of yesterday I saw an article in the media where many buy side and sell side analysts speculated on what the next steps would be that we’d be interested in of course which was very interesting.
It was interesting to know the thoughts of a lot of people but what I almost never do is try to telegraph where we might be interested because a lot of times that’s going to affect other companies and stuff too.
So if you don’t mind I’m just going to avoid that question.
That’s totally fair.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Thanks for taking the question.
I guess just on EPD you witnessed a pretty strong acceleration in growth from your key emerging markets and I just wanted to get a little more detail on some of the factors that drove the acceleration in the second quarter meaning how much was just better execution contribution from new products or just stronger end markets? This is Brian.
How are you doing Jason? I think I’d start—you know first of all recall with India which is our largest market last year I think we all experienced a little bit of a slowdown in that market when they implemented what was called the Drug Price Control Order so the whole industry which is good news for us – I mean this is our largest presence the market has come back up into what I’d say is more high single digits.
It had actually reached low single digits through some of the disruption around the implementation of this control order last year.
But that also with execution is serving very well for us in India driving double digits growth.
We’re set up very nicely for the second half of the year as well both from our execution as well as nice comparison in terms of that market’s rebound.
As I move to Brazil that was one that was more about portfolio expansion.
We had expanded out our products along the therapeutic area that we refer to as our women’s health so that’s going very well.
As I mentioned in China again execution but also coupled with—recall in the first quarter we talked about a plant shutdown to build out capacity for one of our most successful products in the women’s health arena.
That’s starting to come back.
It doesn’t come back all at once but I talked about seeing some benefits in the second quarter and third quarter now that that plant is online.
So we expect the key emerging markets to continue to do well for the rest of the year and when you look at this thing globally with the developed markets business it’s still that nice steady sequential improvement that we were talking about from the beginning of the year.
Okay that’s helpful.
I guess just sticking with EPD and it may be a little premature but lingering question from Monday – from a management perspective you’re bringing on a couple new businesses shedding another one.
So my question is who is going to lead the new and refreshed EPD business? And I realize the end markets are growing a little faster here in emerging markets but is the business going to be run any differently than it is today? Thanks.
Well it already is being run differently and the management that’s going to run it is already there.
There were a number of changes that had been made in the last year and a half or so and some new folks brought into the company some others moved.
I’d say no change anticipated in the management team and I’m sure they’ll be glad to hear that; but that’s already in place.
We’re executing against the plans we have expanding our product lines and our depth in various therapeutic areas.
We’re rolling out our branding strategies in a number of these countries and I think while it’s difficult when you have a whole portfolio of a lot of countries to see the specific needle move in general we track them all pretty individually and by detail and we’re seeing progress on the initiatives that we have in place.
So I think the management and I both expect to see continued improvement in those countries and I think even this year in the third and fourth quarter so I think you’ll see that play out in the second half of the year here.
Great thank you.
Great.
Two questions for us.
I guess first can you talk about where the adult and infant nutritional businesses will sort of settle out over the next several quarters as we annualize the one-time and you know a bit easier comps here with all the manufacturing capacity increases and what that does for gross margins over that window? Once we get through the second half of the year where again you’re going to see strong double-digit growth for the nutrition business we believe that when you weight the two businesses which as you now we’re 55% pediatric 45% adult this should be an upper single-digit growing business.
Interestingly in all the forecasts we look at the adult is growing at roughly the equivalent rate as the pediatrics.
So as Miles indicated earlier it’s an extremely important business to us strategically.
So once we’re through—as you know with this kind of being a first half second half story this year with the recovery I think that upper single digit range is one that we view as sustainable for a business that has great demographics on both the pediatric and adult sides and obviously we’re well invested in a broad range of more rapidly growing markets around the world with our emerging markets strategy.
Okay and then on the diabetes side you talked about Libre being a family of products.
Can you give us some more insights into what that looks like beyond the initial flash version and what sort of time frame we might think about as well as what the regulatory requirements may be for those products given some of the claims you’ve been talking about.
I’d probably say it’s little premature for us to forecast that.
I would only say it’s not a one-off product.
There will be other manifestations of it other versions of it over time.
I think our first priority is to get this first one launched.
I think it will be very well received and very innovative and then it will be followed by others other versions for various segments of the market.
I think it’s just premature for us to comment on what that might be.
Okay.
Maybe I can sneak in another one on the diagnostics side.
You all have talked about kind of a handful of instrument systems coming.
Obviously core labs has been great but within molecular it’s just been a bit weaker.
We haven’t seen those new platforms launched.
Can you give us a bit of an update on any of those and when we might see those? Thank you.
There’s kind of an unprecedented number of systems in development in our diagnostics business broadly defined.
There’s a new family of hematology analyzers new family for blood screening new family for core lab immunoassay and chemistry.
We also have a program underway in our molecular space.
There is our Ibis system in addition to that in molecular a second system there; and then next generation for our point of care business so across the board literally new systems and updated systems in development for all of these businesses.
They obviously can’t all launch at exactly the same time so I’d say there’s sort of a call it a three to five-year frame here where they will all sequentially roll out God willing and everything staying on time.
I think as I said it’s unprecedented for that much to be done in a similar period of time but when and as complete I’d say our diagnostics business will have the most up-to-date delivery platforms in their various spaces across the board in the industry and we’ll be very very well positioned.
Thank you.
Hi thanks for taking my questions.
I’ve got three questions the first on gross margins.
So you’re flagging that you’re going to have a drive on purchasing going forwards and obviously you’ve been putting out some new manufacturing facilities so it sounds like you’ve got quite some opportunity to increase gross margins going forwards unless there’s something in the mix that’s going to pressure that against some of that.
So maybe you can talk about opportunity for gross margin expansion maybe over a two three-year period.
Then second just wondering if you can help— Would you mind holding the second and third question until we answer the first? I’m finding I don’t remember the third by the time I get done with the second.
Sure.
Let’s answer that one first and then we’ll go right back into the second question.
You’re right – you characterized it well.
I think that our manufacturing and supply chain and distribution initiatives and so forth will in fact improve our margins across the board.
That’s been the case for the last three years as well in nutrition and I think that’s primarily what we’re talking about here.
All of the business is focused on margin improvement and as I said there are a number of things that will improve margins; but that has been the case.
Some of that as we’ve seen has dropped into gross margin improvement in the overall company P&amp;L.
In some cases that gross margin improvement has offset either currency fluctuation in the wrong direction or in some cases price pressures in markets or other things from time to time.
I think we call it out pretty well when it occurs where the gross margin improvement has occurred and so forth and as you know price is part of that and price is generally not going up in our businesses around the world.
It’s usually under some pressure somewhere.
So that improvement in gross margin also preserves margins where we do have price pressures and every now and then there’s some country that determines it’s going to have a pricing action of some kind – you know Saudi Arabia Vietnam others from time to time do that and our gross margin improvements have either offset that or further added to the bottom line and I think as we said earlier there’s opportunity here going forward and there continues to be margin expansion opportunity with it.
Second question? So the second one is really if you can help us a bit more about the base cost of developed EPD from the perspective of just thinking how much net cash will drop through for share repurchases as you dispose of the Mylan shares.
Well first of all there’s an assumption there that I would use it all for share repurchase which I’m not.
So I would just call out the fact that it gives me a lot of optionality in terms of cash disposition but I’m probably not going to tell you today what that’s going to be.
Okay.
The third question – and just to be clear this is related to a wire that’s come up this morning saying you may have talked with Sanofi about their mature products business.
Just a little bit more general question off the back of that do you think there is significant opportunity for you to add significant more product breadth to EPD because in the past you’ve talked just about geographic bolt-ons and infilling but obviously a transaction like that – I’m not saying that you are doing it obviously – would add significant product breadth.
Would that be something that was important for the business? Well I’d answer that two ways.
First of all I saw the report on Sanofi and my understanding is that’s a reference to their European-based business and we just are in the process of selling ours so I think these are two completely different questions here.
Would I be interested in broadening our emerging market portfolio? Sure.
Yeah we’re always interested in broadening or deepening our portfolio in our EPD business but for us going forward that’s going to be an emerging market business and so consequently businesses that are similar products but in Europe or the U.S.
would not be of interest to us.
That’s great thank you.
Okay we’ll take one more question.
Good morning.
Miles just a quick kind of maybe trip down memory lane for you here.
As nutritionals approaches normalcy I wonder if you can provide us some perspective 18 months post-spin.
If you go back to the time of the spin you talked about the Abbott growth story.
I think you discussed upper single digit growth.
As we sit here sort of 18 months later I wonder are you getting the growth contribution from the areas you expected and do you still think you have the access to get back to upper single digit growth here? I do.
I think if I look at the single biggest event that was a setback for that business it was the recall in Asia approximately a year ago in that nutrition business which clearly impacted us in China and other countries as I mentioned earlier.
When that happens it’s a year to recover because the consumer is an incredibly quality conscious consumer that once that consumer has shifted to another brand it’s very difficult to regain them.
That wasn’t something anybody anticipated it wasn’t something anybody wanted to happen including Fonterra; but when that happens it does set you back a bit.
I think we’ve recovered about as well as we could have within that year time frame.
I like the progress that our team is making in China and other countries.
The world is volatile.
The great thing about emerging markets is they represent I think terrific growth.
The unfortunate thing about them for businesses that measure their success every 90 days is that they can be pretty volatile and in our case we are in a number of emerging markets like a portfolio which one hopes over time dampens the overall absorption of volatility and I think it does.
I think you have to kind of learn how to shape your portfolio and shape your approach to minimize volatility of markets whether it’s currency driven politically driven whatever the case may be and deliver that growth on a more consistent durable basis for investors.
And of course that’s our intent and that’s what we’re trying to do.
So if I look at our businesses across the board I always think we can do better.
I think we’re getting back to the track we want to be on with nutrition.
I think we’re getting back to the track we want to be on with our pharmaceutical business.
The pharmaceutical business as I’ve said in the past is two very different businesses – there’s the developed market business which is low growth but still attractive and profitable and then much higher growth emerging market business.
And since we’ve defined the company around durable growth our emphasis and focus by strategic intent is on those emerging markets and we think that given the scale necessary for the consolidation that’s happening in those developed markets that at least in our case Mylan was a better home for our business than we were; otherwise we were faced with the possibility of having to expand and consolidate still further in those markets.
For us that wasn’t the same in terms of strategic intent and growth as what we’re trying to do in emerging markets.
So I think that as two of the large businesses in the portfolio I think they are getting back into the shape and direction and top line growth that we intend.
I think as we’ve said everything we’re doing is directed toward that.
I see that evolving in emerging here.
Our first quarter with EPD as you’ll recall we had a plant shut down because we were expanding the plant so there’s a number of factors at work here that I think we’ll see play out in the third and fourth quarter here that will give our investors much more confidence in the ongoing trajectory of our pharma business.
I think the nutrition business will evolve that way over time too – I mean it’s already a very strong business.
It’s doing well and the infrastructure and so forth that we’ve put in place and the recovery that we’ve seen in China and other countries shows and frankly we will have lapped it in the second half the issue we had last year and you’ll see that those growth rates are back where you’d like to see them.
Great.
Maybe just a quick follow up for Tom.
Tom your guidance for gross margin remains unchanged but it still implies that back half recovery.
I guess where you sit now what are some of the factors that give you the confidence that you can get back to that gross margin improvement in the back half of the year? In general I feel like investors are very focused on the Abbott SG&amp;A story and a little bit less focused on the GM story.
What are some of the opportunities for Abbott both in the back half of the year but more specifically over the next couple of years? Thank you.
Well you know the guidance I provided on gross margin was pretty steady really from the second quarter through the fourth quarter.
You know it’s a situation – and we talked about this at the very beginning of the year it was a particularly acute exchange year on the gross margin ratio and that’s playing through—you know it played through in the second quarter it was a bit of a headwind and it’s playing through a little more in the third quarter.
So I think on the gross margin level pretty much all the guidance is steady the rest of the year.
Certainly we’re going to work hard to do as well as we can in that area but I think once we’ve lapped through this year of exchange challenges we’ll be back on the fundamentals and it is something that we’d like to see some steady improvement over time even taking into account some of the challenge Miles outlined in his earlier remarks.
So I think the second half is really more of a sales acceleration story and continuing to drive down these G&amp;A costs to ultimately deliver on the forecast.
Okay well thank you Operator and thank you for all your questions.

Welcome to Abbott’s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call.
All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call.
(Operator Instructions) Should you become disconnected throughout this conference call please dial 1-773-799-3472 and reference the Abbott earnings call.
This call is being recorded by Abbott.
With the exception of any participant’s questions asked during the question-and-answer session the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott’s express written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr.
Brian Yoor Vice President Investor Relations.
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
With me today are Miles White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail.
Following our comments Miles Tom and I will take your questions.
Before we get started some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the expected financial results for 2014.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1(a) Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2013.
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.
Also you will see in our earnings news release this morning that financial results from the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business have been presented as discontinued operations this quarter due to the pending sale to Mylan.
As a result the line items of our consolidated statement of earnings are now reported on the basis of continuing operations.
We also provide in the release a reconciliation between continuing and discontinued operations for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013 and 2014.
For the remainder of 2014 our earnings per share guidance will include results from both continuing operations as well as discontinued operations associated with the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business being sold to Mylan.
Our commentary and guidance for sales and other P&amp;L line items will be for continuing ops only.
In today’s conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott’s ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Okay thanks Brian good morning.
This morning we reported adjusted earnings per share above expectations and another quarter of sequential improvement in total company sales growth.
We’re also raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance range which is now $2.25 to $2.27 representing double-digit growth.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 increased approximately 13% including discontinued operations which is above our previous guidance range.
Today I’ll focus my comments on results from Abbott’s continuing operations for sales increase 6.7% operationally.
Emerging market sales will now represent nearly 50% of Abbott’s total sales and increased 15% in the quarter with double-digit growth and establish pharmaceuticals nutrition and diagnostic.
In the quarter we also advanced number of transactions in our branded generics business to accelerate our ability to drive balanced and sustainable growth in emerging geographies.
We remain on track to divest our developed markets business in Mylan in the first quarter of next year.
Mylan is well positioned with its global scale and capabilities to do well with this business over the long-term.
We completed our acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals at the end of September which establishes Abbott as a top 10 pharmaceutical company in Latin America.
CFR provides scale and a product portfolio that strongly compliments Abbott’s presence in Latin America and more than doubles our branded generic sales in the region.
CFR also brings a network of manufacturing plants and R&amp;D facilities in Columbia Chile Peru and Argentina which further diversifies our cost base in emerging markets.
And most importantly CFR adds top talent with strong local market knowledge and a proven ability to quickly develop manufacturing and bring new products to market.
We expect our announced acquisition of Veropharm to close by the end of the year.
Veropharm positions Abbott to become a top 5 branded generics company in Russia providing us with income for manufacturing and a broad portfolio well aligned to our therapeutic areas of focus.
Following the close of these transactions our established pharmaceuticals business will operate entirely in emerging geographies where the growth of branded generics are driven by favorable demographics including growing healthcare systems and a customer base that largely pays out of pocket for high quality trusted brands.
Moving forward we would expect this business generates sales growth in the upper single to double digits.
We are also executing on our organic growth opportunities including the launch of a number of new products and innovations across our businesses I’ll briefly review our third quarter results.
And I’ll start with nutrition where sales increased double digits this quarter.
We’ve largely recovered from the sales disruption in our international business at the same time we’re executing a multiple new product launches across key geographies.
We continue to invest in our global infrastructure to support the strong global demand from adult pediatric nutrition.
As we discussed last quarter we reinforced our footprint in China to the opening of our new manufacturing plant in Jiaxing and our strategic alliance with Fonterra to invest locally in China’s milk supply.
And last week in India we announced the opening of our third new manufacturing facility this year in nutrition a stronger footprint in our key geographies will allow us to be closer to our customers and work faster to creating customized new products for their needs.
In diagnostics we delivered 6% operational growth in third quarter of sequential improvement from the second quarter driven by continued above market performance in core laboratory diagnostics and point of care diagnostics.
We are funding investments in growth and advanced multiple new system platforms across all three of our diagnostics businesses.
In medical devices our vascular business is performing below our expectations primarily related to sales of our drug eluting portfolio.
We remained focused on improved execution and increasing penetration of absorbing Europe and several key emerging geographies.
MitraClip our structural heart technology delivered strong double digit growth in the quarter and we expect continued adoption in the U.S.
following improved reimbursement national Medicare coverage.
Our peripheral stent Supera also contributed the growth of our new vascular business in the quarter.
In diabetes care we launched our next generation flash glucose monitor FreeStyle Libre into the nearly $4 billion blood glucose monitoring market in Europe.
Libre is a revolutionary new glucose sensing technology which generated very positive feedback early in its launch; it eliminates the need for routine finger sticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes.
And in vision care 70% of our sales are generated by our cataract product which increased double-digits again this quarter.
Our new cataract lenses and the uptick of our catalyst laser cataract system are driving above market growth to support the growing global demand for our cataract lenses we recently booked ground on a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia.
In established pharmaceuticals as we expected sales improve sequentially again this quarter.
The emerging market branded generic business increased double digits as a result of improved commercial execution and continued expansion of product portfolios in several of our therapeutic areas of focus.
We expect continued momentum in EPD as we exit the year including CFR where sales have been growing consistently at a double-digit pace.
So in summary we’re right on track with our expectations that we communicated at the beginning of this year.
Operational sales growth has improved sequentially each quarter.
We’re particularly pleased to see that type of improvement in our branded generics business and nutrition as well as steady global performance in diagnostics and vision care.
We again exceeded adjusted earnings per share exceptions for the quarter and increased the midpoint of our EPS guidance range which results in another year double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
And we’re continuing to build Abbott for global growth over the long term including the CFR acquisition in the third quarter and working toward our first quarter 2015 close of the sale of our developed market branded generics business for Mylan.
I’ll now turn the call over to Tom.
Thanks Miles.
As Brian mentioned upfront because guidance previously provided for the third quarter and the full year 2014 included the developed markets branded generics business for the Mylan we will continue to include the contributions in this business and our EPS guidance for the remainder of 2014.
However our commentary and guidance for sales and other P&amp;L line items this quarter and for the fourth quarter forecast will be for continuing operations only that is excluding the business being sold to Mylan.
Today we reported third quarter diluted earnings per share excluding specified items of $0.62 above our previous guidance range.
Sales from continuing operations that is excluding the developed markets branded generics business increased 6.7% on an operational basis and 5.8% on a recorded basis during the quarter.
Including the contribution from discontinued operations sales would have increase 5.6% on an operational basis in line with previous guidance.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in several businesses including double-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals and nutrition and steady growth in diagnostics and vision care.
Total company sales in emerging markets increased 15% on an operational basis in the quarter.
The adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales adjusted R&amp;D investment was 6% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense was 29.4% of sales from continuing operations.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014 today we’re raising the midpoint and narrowing our EPS guidance range excluding specified items to $2.25 to $2.27 which includes results from our developed markets branded generics business now presented as discontinued operations and reflect double-digit growth over 2013.
We forecast operational sales growth from continuing operations in the mid-single digit for the full year 2014 based on current exchange rates we expect this change to have a negative impact of approximately 2% on our full year recorded sales which is somewhat more negative than previous expectations driven by the recent strengthening of the U.S.
dollar.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2014.
Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 65% of sales adjusted R&amp;D investment of somewhat more than 6% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense of around 30% of sales from continuing operations for the full year 2014.
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014 we forecast double-digit operational sales growth from continuing operations.
As Miles mentioned earlier we recently completed the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals and expect this business to contribute approximately $200 million to sales in the fourth quarter.
Based on current exchange rates we expect this change to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 2.5% on sales in the quarter.
This would result in recorded sales growth in the high single digits for the fourth quarter.
We forecast on adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55.5% of sales adjusted R&amp;D investment approximately 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense of around 28% of sales from continuing operations in the fourth quarter.
So in summary our sales and earnings progression for the year is playing out as we forecasted back in January as we continue to forecast another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
And with that I’ll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook.
Thanks Tom.
This morning I’ll review our third quarter 2014 performance and fourth quarter sales outlook by business.
As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I’ll start with our nutrition business where global sales increase 10% in third quarter.
In our international pediatric nutrition business sales increase 14%.
We’ve recaptured our share in China and Vietnam following the previously recorded 2013 sales disruption and continue to drive uptake of new products.
This includes new infant formula products Similac QINTI and Eleva that we recently launched into the premium segments of the Chinese market to further enhance our competitive position.
International adult nutrition sales increased strong double digit in the quarter represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in this business.
Sales growth is led by continued strong performance of our Ensure brand and double-digit growth in emerging markets.
Last week Abbott announced the opening of our new nutrition manufacturing plant in India the third plant we open this year to increasing demand for our nutrition products.
This new manufacturing plants is one of Abbott’s most technologically advanced nutrition plants in the world and sourced up to 80% of ingredients locally in India.
We will work together with Abbott’s nutrition R&amp;D center in India to deliver innovations to address unmet health needs in pediatric and adult nutrition while also meeting specific local tastes and processes.
In the U.S.
nutrition sales increased low single digits in the quarter in line with expectations.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter we expect global nutrition to deliver double-digit sales growth on an operational basis.
In our diagnostics business sales increased 6% in the third quarter representing sequential improvements from the second quarter where sales in emerging markets growing double-digits.
Core laboratory diagnostics sales increase nearly 7% as we continue to outperform the market.
In the U.S.
sales growth was impacted by comparison to the third quarter of 2013 when sales were higher due to the timing of equipment sales.
Year-to-date growth of 7.5% better reflects the underlying performance of the U.S.
business where we continue to build momentum with our enterprise account commercial model.
International sales in the third quarter increased 8%driven by continued strong growth in emerging markets.
In molecular diagnostics our core focus and largest business is infectious disease testing where year-to-date sales increased mid-single digits.
In the quarter growth in our infectious disease business was offset by decline in some of our smaller businesses as well as timing of tenders in several emerging markets.
In point of care diagnostics worldwide sales increased 6.7% representing a sequential improvement from the first two quarter of the year.
International sales increased 17% as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets.
For the fourth quarter in global diagnostics we’re forecasting mid-to-high single-digits operational sales growth.
In medical devices vascular sales decreased low single digits in the quarter.
Sales growth was relatively flat excluding the impact of the third quarter 2013 sales through up related to a third-party agreement.
We continue to see strong market adoption of MitraClip our breakthrough technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation and growth from Supera a peripheral stent for the superficial femoral artery or SFA.
As Miles mentioned during the third quarter MitraClip received national Medicare coverage and an improved payment rate for the procedure which will help drive adoption of MitraClip in the U.S.
Both structural heart and endovascular products grew double digits in the third quarter globally.
In our drug eluting portfolio on September we presented the first randomized clinical trial result for Absorb our Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold.
One year results from the Absorb II study demonstrated that Absorb provides comparable results to science and lower rate of angina or chest pain.
Also in the quarter we launched additional XIENCE for expanding the potential for Absorb used in more coronary procedures.
As we look ahead we expect to see improvement in vascular sales growth driven by commercial execution and contribution from new products as well as further Absorb penetration as we exit the year.
So for the fourth quarter we expect to see a sequential improvement in growth in the third quarter with relatively flat year-over-year sales on an operational basis.
In diabetes care global sales in the third quarter were somewhat ahead of our expectations as the rate of decline in the U.S.
was moderating.
Outside of the U.S.
we’re focused on driving growth in both emerging and developed markets in our diabetes care business and recently announced European launch of our revolutionary new glucose sensing technology called FreeStyle Libre.
It eliminates routine finger pricks and finger-prick calibration and with glucose levels discreetly through a sensor that can be worn on the back of the upper arm.
In the near term we’re working to obtain reimbursement for Libre in Europe as well as breakthrough market in a number of additional countries next year.
For the fourth quarter in our global diabetes business we expect a mid-single digit decline on an operational basis with international growth offset by the later stages of the market transition in the U.S.
in line with our forecast earlier this year.
In vision care sales increased 9% in the third quarter.
Sales of our cataract product which represents approximately 70% of our vision care business increased double digits outpacing the growth of the global cataract market.
We continue to capture market share with our recently launched premium intraocular lenses including our TECNIS OptiBlue line of lenses in Japan and our TECNIS Toric lenses in the U.S.
and Japan.
In addition we continue to see strong adoption of our new CATALYS laser cataract system.
We are also receiving strong feedback from early adopter of our new TECNIS Symfony extended range of vision intraocular lens that we launched in Europe in the second quarter.
TECNIS Symfony provides patients with a continuous range of vision including far intermediate and near differences but with reduced incidence of halo and glare.
And last week we announced the distribution agreement in the U.S.
with Carl Zeiss Meditec a leading ophthalmology diagnostic company.
The Zeiss product line of diagnostics and visualization systems combined with Abbott's intraocular lenses lens removal systems and laser cataract systems provide surgeons a comprehensive portfolio of cataract products to maximize the visual outcome and streamline patient flow.
For the fourth quarter of the 2014 we expect our global vision care business to grow double digits on an operational basis.
And lastly our established pharmaceuticals business or EPB where sales from continuing operations that is excluding the developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business increased nearly 13% in the quarter.
This strong performance was driven by double digits sales growth across several emerging markets including India Russia Mexico and Vietnam.
This business continues to make meaningful progress and becoming a more consumer oriented organization and is focused on expanding products portfolios in key therapeutic areas.
Implementing new branding initiatives across the portfolio and increasing its focus on marketing to the pharmacy channel.
For the fourth quarter of 2014 we forecast double-digit sales growth on an operational basis from continuing operations in our emerging markets branded generics business.
This includes CFR pharmaceuticals which is expected to contribute sales of approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter.
So in summary sales growth improves sequentially this quarter as we expected and we exceeded earnings-per-share expectations raising the midpoint of our full year guidance range.
We are on track for another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2014.
We will now open the call for questions.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.
Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on a nice quarter.
Miles I wanted to really start with the EPD business and first the updated agreement today with Mylan could you spend a minute on that? Because obviously there was some question about whether that transaction as it was initially constructed.
So A could you comment on that? And then B the EPT performance of this quarter up 12.9%.
Can you just talk about the sustainability of that performance? It seems like a very high number so can you just talk about how we should think about that business going forward thanks.
Well I assume there is one of the question this morning was some clarity on whether or not that transaction with Mylan is going forward I think that’s clear we reported discontinued operations - financials et cetera and as we very clearly said in the earnings release yesterday tracking forward no change probably that’s what comment on that.
So that was special takeaway some speculation on certainty there and that’s all tracking according to schedule.
The performance of the remainder of EPD actually it’s both halves we’ve actually seen improvement in the developed markets part of the business which is good thing that’s the part that we’re divesting to Mylan.
And we've seen improvement in the emerging market piece.
I think some improvement in market and economy in few of these markets like India but overall let’s say improvement in the overall performance of the business which we’ve been expecting and waiting for and that was kind of what we intended and what we planned and we’re seeing it.
So that’s gratifying I think everybody around the world every company I have seen reporting as expressing caution around economies everywhere and currencies everywhere so forth and I think one issue that I continue to track closely which we’ve obviously less control of then the operating performance of these businesses is just the overall currency volatility around the world and that of course effects this business because it’s purely an ex-U.S.
business but other than that I think what we’re seeing here and gradual improvements in our performance in the business is good that’s good and I’m feeling pretty good about that because as you know earlier in the year we were projecting sequential improvements in this business as the year went on and you guys directly ask about it every quarter and we’re seeing that.
Your greatest fear is that you don’t see that so we’re pleased with that now in addition we add CFR to that CFR’s performance in Latin America has been consistent double-digit growth and that’s also a plus and going forward.
So I think if you look at the underlying performance of the business we exceeded double-digit growth and there is very little CFR in here because of the timing close there is not a lot of CFR in the numbers and even without it business is going double digit.
So I’m pleased with what I see in emerging markets when we’re done with the Mylan transaction with the developed market business this business will be purely an emerging market business which has been our strategic intent to focus on because we see the conditions in those markets and the developing economies quite favorable to the business over time.
So that remains an important strategic focus for us and I think the investors now will have a much clearer visibility of transparency to the opportunity in those markets.
One of the great things about emerging markets is the growth potential there of these economies and the healthcare systems and that’s why we’re focused on that that’s a very important source of growth it comes with volatility which means you got to be diverse you got to be diverse in geographies you’re in fortunately we’re well spread out I think CFR helped us even further with that.
So I like the prospects for the business and I’m glad we’re seeing the fundamental improve.
So Miles just two quick follow ups if I can.
So one obviously one you're confident that the transaction is going to go through.
Two the piece that we talked about that you didn't really address in all of your opening comments of this call was the vascular business which obviously had a difficult quarter.
So can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that business strategically and how you turn that business around given your success now in turning around EPD? Thanks.
Well first of all back to your original question about confidence.
We’re right on track with our transaction with Mylan and I’m superstitious enough not to want to speculate or hypothesize or whatever.
I would say we’re on track with what we said what we expected and everything we’re doing is pointed at the conclusion on time on schedule as described.
And I don’t know what else to say about it I don’t really want to get into a lot of speculation about other stuff but I think it’s as I said tracking exactly where we wanted to be.
So that’s about as much as I can say and only thing I should say.
The vascular business is a disappointment.
There is just no question about that.
And this is our performance.
You know to a degree I think all of us competing in this business can look at a slower market but this isn't about slower markets this is about us.
The part of this business where I am most disappointed is the US in us and our performance there.
There's a lot of price competition but you know when there is price competition that price affects everybody so the whole market is experiencing price competition.
I think that there's a fair amount of commoditization that's happening here its customers returning more and more towards value and less and less toward differentiation and performance of products.
And I think when that happens your competitors begin to sell on price and other factors.
I think this market has definitely changed.
The dynamics the competitive dynamics have changed and our approach to it needs to change as well and that's just a fact.
For us you know if you look at the performance is primarily the stent business and it's primarily the US.
Now is there a residual effect in Europe there is is there a residual effect in Japan? There is.
I’d say in both countries both geographies that is Japan and Europe its price.
But in addition I think that there's a definitely a share war going on where the leaders in the category and as such we’re targeted by everybody else.
And we all seem to be dealing with that as well as we should.
And I think that's pretty clear.
So at this point I don't have any projections to make to you other than you've got our full attention.
Thank you good morning everybody.
I wanted to sort of follow along the train of thought on the vascular business.
And Miles if we make the comparison to the turnaround you may be able to execute on EPD it seems like it's not completely analogous.
And the reason I say that is EPD operated in very attractive end markets largely in the emerging markets.
Whereas in vascular the vast majority of the business is in stents which I think would be hard to call an attractive market.
So as you think about this business strategically do you need to rethink the business mix or the potential to engage in more aggressive portfolio modification to really change the growth portfolio of that vascular franchise? Well first of all let me tell you I don't see an analogy between this and EPD other than there's been a time when both have performed below our expectations and we frankly - which in the pro forma at or above our expectations so there is the comparability.
Other than that you’re right.
They’re different.
The answers to the device business or the stent business are clearly different.
The dynamics of the market are different and so on.
In our case I think there is two things.
One is we clearly have to deal with our competitiveness in the stent category and in particular in the US.
We simply have to figure out here how to be a lot more competitive than we apparently have been.
So that's point number one point number two beyond that I think for this business to be a contributor to growth it's got to be broader.
We've got to broaden our footprints here.
We've got to broaden into new areas and new innovations.
Now in our case MitraClip the peripheral the longer term prospects for Absorb and frankly any other expansion beyond that they're all considerations here.
We can't just sit here and be a drug-eluding stent company and rely on that.
So it's clearly our intent to broaden the business and grow other dimensions of it in the device area.
But you have to do that on strong foundations so we've got to fix the competitiveness of the underlying business first.
And we’re clearly looking at how we expand and shape this business going forward.
I have no intention of being out of the business I've no intention of shrinking I have no intention of any other changes other than full steam ahead but I’d say the underlying competitiveness and then expansion from there is what's on the table.
Okay that's helpful for perspective and then maybe just on the underlying business maybe you could talk a little bit more about adult nutritionals that that is a franchise that looks to be doing reasonably well and it obviously looks to be a pretty big opportunity in China on a go forward basis.
Could you maybe just help us understand the adult opportunity that exists in front of you? And then how we should think about the impact that has to the global growth of that nutrition business on a go forward basis.
I’d tell you I think this is a great business and again I always think we can do better at it.
And in this case it’s very different dynamic.
We are the adult nutrition business worldwide.
And its one where - it's not about riding growth or competing with particular competitors because we're quite large I guess I would say in the area.
So we have to drive the growth and create the demand as well.
And the single biggest uncreated opportunity thus far is China.
And we’re recently launching into that arena with powder-based products and so forth.
We’ll learn our way in here.
We think we understand the dynamics of the market but you always think you understand the dynamics of the market then the market teaches you more.
In this case we’ve launched.
I think there's a big opportunity there.
I think there's a future opportunity beyond that beyond the powder-based business in liquids.
And we’re prepared for that as well but I think we’ll go at this - I don’t want to say cautiously because that's not the right term.
But thoughtfully progressively we’ll establish our distribution establish our brand establish our products establish us in the categories.
The dynamics in China are different than the dynamics in the US or other countries of the world their own behaviors and practices as consumers are different and so it’s not like you can just take up a U.S.
or European or Latin American model and apply China you can’t.
But I think there is a big opportunity there and I think there is opportunity in the rest of the world to continue to grow the business.
In this case we don’t measure our success so much on shares we do in so many other categories we measure our success on real growth because our share is high and I think that a very high share and given segment you can’t often too comfortable and that drive the opportunity or the market growth.
I don’t think our people are comfortable I think they all understand there's a much bigger opportunity there to drive growth in this business we certainly do like that.
And so for me that's a real upside for us that's on our radar screen for a lot of investment attention and as you know we've recently invested in additional plant capacity not only in China and India but also here in the U.S.
in Ohio where we built a brand-new liquid plant that is specifically dedicated to this business.
And we’re already into phase 2 expansion there so we've got great expectations of the ability this business to drive growth in the future both here and in the areas overseas.
Okay and maybe lastly for you or Tom even if you don't monetize the Mylan shares that you'll receive still be sitting on a pretty big chunk of cash fairly under the level of interest rate still level of potentially rising and any updates on how we should think about use of capital going into next year and how you might look to offset the Mylan dilution and any headwinds that might materialize from foreign exchange in 2015.
Well you got similar questions there one is sort of capital allocation and the Mylan shares and then currency so let me just deal with the capital allocation first.
I’d say I'm probably not going to tell you right now what our intentions would be or what we’ll do.
I'd say your best proxy for that is just to simply to look at we've been good stewards and capital allocators in the past we always pay a healthy dividend we always try to balance share repurchase but at the end of the day we also have been investors in strategic growth opportunities and so forth and I think the best expectation is a mix of the above.
We’re not going to run the one side of the ship and tip.
We’re going to keep things relatively balanced.
I think we’ll be opportunistic about our Mylan holding.
Obviously we don't want to do anything to destabilize that holding or either company.
And we think that's a pretty strong and valuable investment for us so we can afford to be I’d say thoughtful about the disposition of those shares over time.
Although it's not our intent to be long-term shareholders of Mylan I think that's been pretty clear.
And you know I'm glad to have the capital and the challenge how to best allocated for our investors but I think if we look at our track record historically we've been pretty good at balancing that for the range of investors we have those that rely on the income those that rely on a cash return those that rely on good strategic investments so forth so without betraying any future direction here and certainly time and opportunity can change here so you can expect more of the same from us and not something dramatically different in what you come to expect.
With regard to currency I note that a lot of companies that have reported in last couple of weeks a flag caution around currency around the world and you know rightly so.
As you know our business is 70% international and in the continued operations now we’ll be about 50% of emerging markets and some of those currencies have been disappointing or volatile if you’re an American company and competing in dollars.
And it remains a challenge for us so over the past few years we like other companies have taken quite a dent from currency and I’d point out that over that time as you know the companies made tremendous strides in improving margins improving gross margins and distribution margins and unfortunately well fortunately and unfortunately we've done that because it’s been able to absorb a lot of the currency hit and all pricing pressure that we've experienced around the world over the last couple of years and we still manage to improve margins but or it would be eroding the bottom line that we’re experiencing.
So going forward I don't think any American company likes to have to keep dealing with that but for a period of time it appears to me we’re going to be under some exchange pressure at companies around the world and expense in the market basket mix.
Over the long term our best hedge against currency fluctuations is to have our cost basis in the markets where we serve.
And what I mean by that is our production our plans our products we've got a matchup some of our production in a proportion with profitability of markets and in fact that means producing end markets for the market and a lot of these large emerging markets and even the smaller ones that want foreign investments or want American brands or American companies or frankly European companies they also want you to invest there to build plants and employ people et cetera in their markets and over the long haul the best hedge against currency is to have your costs where your profits are and we happen to have profits in a lot of countries of the world and so we've got to ensure that we have also thought through how to put some of our production capacity R&amp;D capacity and so forth there we can’t solely be exporters from the United States or concentrated places capital all your cost in India and exports it to the rest of the world.
You've actually got to match it up where your profits are invest in most countries and mitigate exchange.
So I think over the next three years that's something that's going to get a lot of focus from us and other multinational that are 40% 50% 60% international companies and businesses.
And you’re going to see many of us working to balance that overtime because to the extent that the kind of currency we've experienced continues and we expect it to continue in the 2015.
I’d say right now you know I'm not ready to even start hinting about the 2015.
We always start the year targeting double digits.
And we always do target double digits.
We always set a high bar for ourselves even in small economy.
But the hardest part of predicting this is the currencies.
And then we still deliver on the top of that.
So I think overtime the only real way to mitigate currency is to do as I just described.
You can head short-term but that's it short-term and for the long-term we’ve got to deal with that.
Because I think if we want the growth from a participation of these markets then we've also got to shape our business to deal with the fluctuations of currencies because as you know our investors require us to get it right every quarter.
Miles I just want to come back to a strategic question here and you know and with nutrition back on track and the [receipting] in EPD you have two legs of the stool growing out in excess of the target rate you laid out for Abbott at the spin.
Devices is the obvious departure which is more vascular and diabetes but one of your larger diversified peers is actually getting smaller in devices.
And I guess the question is even though everyone's discussing large device consolidation in light of the strength you have in the other two legs and arguably better secular fundamentals in this business is why even bother getting much bigger in devices versus doing tuck in technologies for focusing on better execution? Well I’d say two things.
First of all I’ll correct you a little bit and say I got three major businesses that are doing really well.
I think diagnostics is doing well too.
And I think relative to the kind of opportunities diagnostics has and how it’s been performing it’s been a really solid performer over the last few years and has a hell of the bank of systems and new products coming.
So I think your analysis and I'd say look - and by the way I haven't told nutrition are back on track you just did.
But I keep the fire to our feet here on this performance.
But okay let’s take you description and say the established pharmaceutical business and nutrition are trending in the right direction in terms of growth expansion and so forth.
I think diagnostics is going to be a very solid performer at least devices.
And I would take that in three pieces and say you know the diabetes cure business actually I think is doing very well.
I think they've stabilized the underlining business relative to the competitive bidding dynamics of the U.S.
Every major competitor took their hit there.
We just launched a unique and I say spectacular products that in Europe at this point that I think is going to drive a whole new generation of performance there that we’re excited about.
So I think in terms of things that we would do for our diabetes care business we're pretty happy with how that's progressing at this point.
In our medical optics business it’s best-performing division in the company right now which is ironic because as you know for a couple of years after we acquired it we kept reporting disappointing performance to you and of course you all really challenge us on that.
But that business is performing well taking share in its business.
It's had a great run here of new product delivery and continues to.
So I like what I see and medical devices out of those two businesses at this point good innovation good R&amp;D productivity good commercial execution good expansion good platform I just can't say enough good about it.
That leaves vascular and vascular has got challenges which I already talked about.
So that’s the one part of our release where you’d say I am disappointed in the trajectory of disappointed in what I see in terms of performance.
And we know that.
I mean nobody is going to be surprised to hear me say that over the phone.
So you can look at it any number of ways you can say well that's not very good any more.
We’ll just do something with that or shrink or just get rid of it or whatever.
And I don't want to think that's necessary.
I think right now our issue isn't - you can say the market is slower.
All markets are slower.
All markets are slower.
There's no question about that.
First issue here is our performance our strategy our execution how we’re doing our business in these markets.
And relative to our competitors I don't think you abandon commitment to our investments in the business because of your own execution I think you go picture execution.
And in our case that's what I'm going to focus on.
Do I think there's still a lot of opportunity in medical devices? I do.
I think there is opportunity there are some segments of medical devices that are attractive to us and some that are not.
There's some that we would not choose to be in and having chosen to be in and there are some that we would choose to be in.
And I'd say that ebbs and flows it's not clear given point in time what’s going to evolve what’s going to develop.
I’d say we all know that the easy part of it with a big tailwind of innovation funded by government reimbursements and so forth that's not as easy anymore.
Now you've really got to compete and you've really got to be innovative and you've really got to be better at it in your competition and you got to put a value proposition on the table with a product somebody wants and is willing to pay for it.
So I think right now my focus on the device business is both fixing the base of that particular business as I described and looking at where we would selectively choose to invest or expand I think one of the benefits of being large and diverse as we are is that we can afford to absorb occasional poor performance or economic downturn or whatever the case maybe and fix the business or improve its performance but we can afford to be patient about what new opportunities may come along and where we want to invest.
There've been a number of transactions that we've done over time to build the company that have been from a timing standpoint opportunistic.
We track those businesses and those segments for a long period of time and when an opportunity presented itself that fit and it was economically good for us and our investors then we pounced on it.
And I think in this case some dimensions of the future of the device business require some patience here because the markets as you know aren't as favorable as they could be and it's not clear when that will change and it's not clear where the new opportunities in some of the areas of devices will be attractive.
But I think for the long-term and especially in some out of the U.S.
geographies and so forth there is still a lot of opportunities here so I’m not ready to throw the challenge and miss it all.
And Miles just to follow-up on something you mentioned on nutrition U.S.
adult very very strong your pediatric maybe little less so.
Is pediatric the business that you’d like to see greater improvement and what steps need to be taken to do that? I'm not sure I understood the question there.
Just in terms of nutrition we had all U.S.
adult very strong and in pediatric maybe not as strong as we expected and given your comments on nutrition back on track but not quite where you wanted I wonder it’s the area of improvement is that more in pediatric than this is in adult and what specifically has to happen in pediatric nutrition to improve that performance.? Yes okay.
As you know over the last 3-4 years there has been some largely there that impacted the pediatric nutrition business usually in China.
And the recall that we had over a year ago clearly affected the business in China and several other countries.
And when that happens to the pediatric business it typically takes a year or more to recover.
And you might note that one of our competitors who was impacted more than we were by that particular recall has not recovered and we have.
So I think first thing I'd say is our team in China and Saudi Arabia and other places Vietnam they’ve done a wonderful job recovering not only share they had in the market but performance trajectory brand confidence with the consumer et cetera and we’re seeing that now.
While we completely there we’re close that cost a year’s worth of growth and base and so forth to those countries.
We're in a good trajectory in China a lot of new product launches are going on right now that are driving us I think very nicely I'm not sure we’re going to be satisfied and let ourselves to be satisfied in pediatric business in China until we've taken incremental share over and above where we were when the recall happened but we’re on a good trajectory there and I think the team is doing well at that.
We’ve a launched a lot of new products around the world country by country over the last three years our R&amp;D productivity in the nutrition business has been exceptional tops in the company and then put a lot of new products into the marketplace and it's our own commercial execution that needs to make those products successful in those markets.
So I'd say we're in so many countries that the opportunity from a pediatric standpoint is really strong really good and driven by good demographic circumstances in those countries and economic development circumstances.
So I’m pleased with all of that.
As I turn to the U.S.
the U.S.
has always been Abbott competition there's no tailwind of growth for the pediatric business in the United States this is hand-to-hand combat.
That's primarily Mead Johnson.
And they’re to be respected for medical competitor and they make us better and hopefully we make them better I think they're a very strong competitor with both relatively equivalent share in the United States and we just slug it out every day and I think that puts a lot of pressure on both companies to be innovative to perform well to always be looking at new ways to reach the consumer.
And the medical community and in our case I think we've done really well.
I think that our share growth our share gain in various segments of the business has been excellent and if you asked me if I'm satisfied I'm never satisfied.
I always want us to do better than we've done and I think the attention that we give that business is warranted and we've got a lot of attention on that business.
Because I think it can do even better than it has I think we've got really good management team there and I think the opportunity and the upside for us is good.
It's not a market driven growth it’s a competition driven growth we have to compete.
And I tell the people in the company that if you really want to see head-to-head competition and understand what competition looks like in a business whether the pediatric nutrition business because in every country of the world it is head-to-head with our competitors.
And I think we've done really well there from share standpoint and gross standpoint to access that market so that gets a lot of attention and focus for us.
It’s a profitable business it generates strong cash flow.
I like everything about it.
Good morning thanks for taking the question so just one multi-part question for me just starting with the Mylan deal.
I think when you announced the deal you said it would be $0.22 diluted any update from the new terms? And how should we think about EPS growth off of the 2014 base with the Mylan dilution and the CFR accretion? And just lastly on the same theme I think Miles in the past you said that you tried to make up any delusion from M&amp;A.
Is that still the case following the Mylan deal? Thank you.
Going down the list no change at all in our -- Just to be clear that’s comps.
No change at all on our forecast of 2015 impact of the divestiture of the developed markets business for EPD to the Mylan.
That stays at the $0.22.
We estimated that in July.
CFR the way to think about that is we indicated that would add $0.07 to any baseline you would develop in 2015.
And the third question was was what Larry? I think in the past you and Miles I think it's Miles I think I've heard say that you would try to make up any dilution from the M&amp;A is that still the case here? I mean I don’t know if that’s quite the right way to phrase to I mean.
We are very sensitive to dilution and I think if you go back and the many deals we’ve done in the last several years investors have not been impacted by dilution on any deal and so our efforts have always been that if there is some modest impact of the business that we find the way to manage through that without impacting investors.
And I think that’s the way to approach it and that’s definitely in our history and I continue to be way we think about deals going forward.
You know Larry I would just add to it.
There is $0.22 on this divestiture of this business and that’s - its chunk of make up now obviously our EPS well figured in that but that all chunk of makeup.
CFR will offset fair amount of that.
And then I would only point out that to the question earlier we aren’t constrained with capital in terms of opportunities.
But we want to be opportunistic in terms of any opportunities that we had with the company so I don’t want to just rush out and you’re not suggesting this I understand.
But obviously deploy capital is simply replace EPS and in long-term I am always looking to build EPS and grow the Company.
So we clearly with not only the continuing cash we earn and accumulate but as the Mylan proceeds and so forth have tremendous flexibility for M&amp;A and kind of without constraint.
The only thing that constrains us is opportunities and fit of those opportunities and so on.
So I think to the degree that they are investors who look at the net let’s call it dilution from the sale of scaffold product business in the developed markets to Mylan I would say be patient you can’t offset that or fix that in a few weeks but longer term obviously our motive is to grow and improve the company.
And I just can’t predict the timing of that but I can certainly figure all the possibility in the all deal is.
And Larry I’ll just add one more thing to what Miles said and the way I entered the question.
Obviously Miles just pointed in the near term we will have - we won’t have the earning of that particular business but as we talked about that in July and as you saw on this quarter and this first quarter reported continuing operation you saw significantly enhanced top line growth rate a better bottom line growth rate and that obviously investors like that message when we deliver in July and that’s when we shouldn’t lose as we move into 2015.
Thanks.
Morning Miles hi Tom.
Miles you've approach this in multiple ways but I'd sort of like to ask you more directly when I think about the last year or so you've done an amazing amount of operational and portfolio reshaping.
I mean clearly it seems like vascular is something that you're going to be paying more attention to.
But if you list the top three priorities for your attention here where are you focused and you know operationally and portfolio perspective now that you've addressed so many of the major challenges? I am focused on vascular and I am focused on devices.
I think you think about where you spend your time it’s not like you run the one thing and only spend your time there.
I mean they all got a lot of time and attention from all of us but we know very clearly where we’re headed and what we want to execute.
What we have to do in almost every business here where we don’t seem to be executing or defining that future as well is clearly in the vascular business and I think it’s not even devices it’s the vascular business and we can think of the vascular business as vascular we can think of it more broadly as medical devices exclusive of optics and probably just care center for minute and I’d say that particular leg has both fix it dimension to it and an expansion of future strategy dimension to it and its capital so that’s something that’s going to get a lot of attention from all of us and more or so I mean I would say we believe we have been paying sufficient attention to all the things necessary in that business but clearly it shows in the performance right now but that’s not sufficient and we’ve got to take through this a lot more thoroughly.
And I think thinking from a standpoint of being more successful we just got to be a lot more successful not only in the current business but in the future.
So I guess if you said where is the majority of my worry time spent or my focus time or strategy time or whatever it’s with my folks in the vascular business now.
Got you.
And just to last operational questions.
If you could talk a bit more about China are you back to normal in China? And do you think the new plant distribution from Tera the new products had we think about growth and share there you know over the next year or two? It seems like there could be it could be quite extraordinary.
And just last briefly remind us on the flash FreeStyle how big the opportunity is I know the market is huge how big an opportunity how big a product could this be? And remind us about the US approval and launch times thanks so much?  Okay with - China yes I think we’re back to where we were or we ahead of where were we made up for the last year no but we’re back to where we were in my view.
And with regard to prospects in China going forward I’d say the sort of the near term and the long term the near term is often a bumpy ride in China and that can be because of local conditions it can be economy it can be the government it can be the unexpected recall it can be anything China is a bumpy ride and yes it’s a very attractive long term market so we made long term commitments and investments and have a long term strategy there including the ownership and development of our own dairies and own milk supply inside the country and I think that is unique among multinationals at this point.
We’ve ensured our own supply and our own access to ingredients at a very high quality level et cetera and I think for the long term that makes a big difference we’re very very well positioned.
So I think the prospects in China are very good for the long term in spite of the fact that it’s an occasionally bumpy ride okay and I think the underlying potential dynamics are all very strong and very good it’s a very competitive place it’s a different place to do business.
But I can say that about any market around the world and I know people say it would they tend to lump emerging markets together like they’re all the same they’re not the same and they’re no two that’s same and yes they represent tremendous growth and I think China does in particular.
Now in our case I’d say we’re pretty spread across a lot of foreign markets and emerging markets around the world because we don’t want to be over dependent on just China just India just Russia just Brazil et cetera.
So as you know with our CFR transaction CFR doesn’t happen to be substantial in Brazil or Mexico or very large market it’s in a log of next level markets medium size et cetera where there is tremendous opportunities.
In our case we don’t risk to over index necessarily just in China or India now when - market we want to be very successful in it so with the largest healthcare company largest pharmaceutical company in India and I like that position but at the same time our share is at a point where there is still tremendous growth opportunity ahead of us we just don’t want to be over dependent on any one market and while China is a tremendous growth opportunity so it’s the rest of the world.
With regard to Libre which is the flash glucose product just reference I don’t know what I can tell you about the potential is to be honest I think we’re going on at the beginning here with I think modest financial expectations but aggressive marketing intent we’re going at this a different way I don’t want to be overly reliance on reimbursement because I think this product has tremendous consumer or user appeal for the insulin dependent diabetic and I think the experience for that particular patient or user is so superior to what’s available today or what they can do today that I think our challenge is to establish the value proposition and the product and it’s benefits and it’s use and it’s experience to that patient group.
And if we do that well then it won’t as dependent on get keeping your hurdles of government reimbursement et cetera although it may be well enhanced by that at some point but we’re trying to go about it more from a consumer approach perspective and go direct to the patient with this and to the extent that all regulatory circumstances allow.
So I think that’s got great potential opportunity I don’t know how to put a dollar value on that yet so I’m reluctant to kind of Forecast one.
Our team in diabetes care knows that almost any number they give me won’t meet my expectations and I think that’s kind of how we live it internally right now it’s not clear that can completely project what the uptick will be or how fast but we’re very pleased by initial reactions of consumers and professionals and physicians and so forth.
And I think after we’ve had some months of experience we’ll be better able to put some numbers around what we expect here in terms of continuing trajectories expansion share gain et cetera in the biggest user group there is which is insulin dependent diabetic and the frequent tester.
So I think that’s the best I can tell you about that at this point right now we got an awful lot of expectation and hope and we’re not overly focused on meeting particular numbers because right now the numbers are small of course because that’s the initial launch phase but it’s launched in 7 new countries and that’s going to be pretty good test for us.
Okay thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions.

Welcome to Abbott’s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call.
All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call.
[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.
With the exception of any participant’s questions asked during the question-and-answer session the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott’s express written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr.
Brian Yoor Vice President Investor Relations.
Okay good morning and thank you for joining us.
With me today are Miles White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail.
Following our comments Miles Tom and I will take your questions.
Before we get started some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the expected financial results for 2014.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1(a) Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2013.
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments as except required by law.
Note that financial results from the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals and animal health businesses are reported as discontinued operations due to the pending sale of these businesses.
As a result the line items of our consolidated statement of earnings are reported as continuing operations or excluding the results of these two businesses.
To help facilitate year-over-year comparisons we filed an 8-K on Tuesday of this week that provides historical results from Abbott's continuing operations for the first three quarters of 2014.
In addition our 2015 guidance provided today for sales P&amp;L line items and earnings per share is for continuing operations only.
In today's conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott’s ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Okay thanks Brian good morning.
Today I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2014 but in particular our outlook for 2015.
We made good progress against our objectives last year and we see good positive underlying momentum in our businesses going into 2015.
However as you know recent macroeconomic events have dominated the discussion on company outlooks for 2015 in particular the significant strengthening of the dollar against almost every currency during the fourth quarter of 2014 and in the 2015 as well as the impact of the draconian price of oil on the global economic outlook.
These factors will affect the 2015 forecast for most multinational companies including Abbott but while many are focused on the negative aspects of these events I'd note that they will impact countries and companies in different ways.
Abbott will clearly face some headwinds while emerging markets currencies have devalued however underlying fundamental growth remained strong.
In fact countries such as India and China where Abbott has a strong presence will benefit economically from the lower price of oil and while the weakening of the euro impacts our European based revenue the fluctuations of this particular currency will not impact our bottom line as a result of our European cost base and this should provide some durability to our result.
So while I'll discuss currency in more detail when I review our 2015 outlook the bulk of my remarks here will address what we control our commercial and operational execution our new product introductions and our efforts to reduce costs and expand margins.
So for the full year 2014 we delivered operational sales growth of 5.5% including acquisitions.
Sales growth rates improved sequentially each quarter last year as we expected and sales in emerging markets increased nearly 13%.
We expended both growth and operating margins and achieved adjusted earnings per share of $2.28 including results related to the established pharmaceutical developed markets business.
This exceeded our guidance range and represents year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of more than 13%.
During the year we continued to build Abbott's investment identity as a durable and reliable growth company following a number of actions we took last year were broader and deeper in emerging markets and were more consumer facing.
In short we are more present were the growth in healthcare is taking place now and will be over the long term.
In established pharmaceuticals we further positioned a division for faster growth.
We added CFR Pharmaceuticals which provides the scale manufacturing R&amp;D and product portfolio to establish Abbott as a top-10 pharma company in Latin America.
We acquired Veropharm positioning Abbott as a top five branded generic company in Russia.
Both CFR and Veropharm provide Abbott with in-country manufacturing to bring us closer to our customers as well as better match our cost with our sales and currency in those regions.
And we're on track to close on the sale of the EPD developed markets business in the first quarter our business that performed above expectations in 2014 and is well positioned to move forward with Mylan.
Last year in our nutrition business we increased our local presence by investing in our global infrastructures.
We opened three new manufacturing plants in China India and the U.S.
and we partnered with world's largest dairy co-operative Fonterra to invest locally in China's milk supply.
These investments are a reflection of the strong underlying demand for our high quality adult and pediatric products.
In Medical Devices we positioned our portfolio for stronger growth over the long term.
We entered a $3 billion fast growing electrophysiology market through the acquisition of Topera.
In vascular we achieved improved reimbursement and coverage from MitraClip in the U.S.
which should further expand adoption and we presented the first of multiple randomized clinical trials underway for ABSORB.
In medical optics we broke ground on a new facility in Malaysia to expand manufacturing capacity for our cataract lenses driven by strong global demand for cataract surgeries.
And in diabetes care we established a new market with our Flash glucose monitoring device FreeStyle Libre launched directly to consumers in Europe last fall.
It eliminates the need for routine fingersticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes.
In diagnostics we delivered another year of mid-to-high single-digit growth well balanced across both the developed world and emerging markets.
And in Europe we introduced our IRIDICA testing system what we believe will be a breakthrough in the infectious disease area.
We're entering 2015 with good momentum.
The fundamentals of our business are strong and the growing trends across our markets remain positive.
The innovations we're launching are driving share gains and we're investing in our businesses to drive above market growth over the long term.
We expect to step up in our 2015 sales growth rate the high single-digit operational growth including acquisitions with emerging markets expected to contribute another year of double-digits performance.
From a currency perspective we expect around 6% negative impact to sales from foreign exchange.
This is roughly double the impact we had expected just three months ago and is in line with what a number of other companies and analysts have forecasted as part of their outlooks for 2015.
Currency is a headwind that's impacting all multinationals and our assumption for this impact has been incorporated into our 2015 adjusted earnings-per-share guidance from continued operations of $2.10 to $2.20 a share reflecting top tier growth at the midpoint of the range.
Strong business performance and growth in operating margin expansion have and will continue to help offset even these more pronounced currency impacts in 2015.
At the same time we need to continue to invest in our businesses to drive sustainable long-term growth.
And in 2015 I'm optimistic about our prospects.
In nutrition our R&amp;D organization has been the most productive it has ever been launching multiple products over the last several years.
In 2014 in China this included two new infant formula products Eleva and Similac QINTI in new market segments.
We expect continued momentum in 2015 including our new Ensure product in China which is the first product introduced in the newly established Adult Nutrition category in this country.
We're also building our brand in India.
Local R&amp;D manufacturing and supply chains are fully established.
We recently rolled out our first line of simple products produced in our new state-of-the-art facility.
Margin improvement remains a key priority for our nutrition business and we expanded its operating margin by several hundred basis points each of the last two years.
Our original target was to reach 20% of sales by 2015 and we exceed that goal in 2014.
Going forward we expect further margin expansion in this business.
In Established Pharmaceuticals we're continuing to improve our commercial execution by strengthening our capabilities in key geographies and channel expanding our product portfolios through innovation that's both fast and locally driven and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers who are taking even greater role and making decisions about their healthcare.
We're also strengthening our local scale and infrastructure through the integration of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm.
Both of these acquisitions enhance our local market insights knowhow and our commercial capabilities as well as help build out our portfolios in our core therapeutic areas.
And finally as I mentioned we anticipate closing on the sale of our developed markets business to Mylan in the first quarter.
We will receive 110 million shares of Mylan stock which provides us with significant optionality given our strong balance sheet and ability to redeploy the net proceeds from the ultimate sale of Mylan shares.
In medical devices we're investing in a number of new products across diabetes care vascular and medical optics.
The medical optics and our cataract business a steady stream of new products over the last two years has resulted in several points of share gains.
In 2015 we expect continued strong growth of our cataract business driven by more than 20 new product launches across multiple geographies as well as continued expansion of our laser cataract system CATALYS.
In vascular we're continuing to drive uptake of our new products MitraClip Supera and Absorb as well as our newest drug-eluting stent XIENCE Alpine launched in the U.S.
and recently approved in Japan.
In diabetes care we'll expand FreeStyle Libre into multiple new markets over time targeting more than $8 billion global blood glucose monitoring markets.
Strong patient awareness has exceeded our initial expectations based on our direct-to-patient sales model.
We are already executing on our capacity expansion and we're looking to secure broader reimbursement for Libre.
And finally diagnostics which remains one of our most durable and reliable growth businesses consistently delivering mid-to-high single-digit operational sales growth the past four years.
We will continue to execute on our commercial strategy and core laboratory diagnostics in both developed and developing markets.
We are also investing simultaneously in the development of next-generation system platforms in blood screening immunoassay clinical chemistry hematology molecular diagnostics and point-of-care.
Margin improvement in diagnostics once again exceeded our expectations increasing nearly 100 basis points versus 2013.
Our gross margin improvement initiatives are continuing to yield results and we expect continued steady margin expansion in this business.
So to summarize as we enter 2015 we expect a step up in full year 2015 operational sales growth into the high single-digit with double-digit growth in emerging markets and we expect continued growth in operating margin expansion as we execute on our division improvement programs and back office support initiatives.
While we anticipate currency to be a more significant headwind this year than in 2014 the long term fundamentals of our business are healthy and we remain committed to increasing returns to shareholders.
In addition to our dividend and share repurchase activity our strong balance sheet and additional flexibility from the Mylan transaction provide us with a significant opportunity to invest in strategic growth opportunities to continue to shape Abbott for long term durable growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss 2014 results in more detail and our 2015 outlook.
Tom? Thanks Miles.
Before I review our financial performance and outlook I'd like to remind you that my remarks today regarding 2014 earnings per share will include the contributions from the developed markets branded generics business that we agreed to sell to Mylan and the animal health business that we've agreed to sell to Zoetis.
Both of these transactions are expect to close in the first quarter of 2015.
This basis of comparison is consistent with the adjusted EPS guidance we've provided in our folder.
All of my comments for sales and other P&amp;L line items this quarter and also our 2015 forecast will be for continuing operations only and that is excluding the businesses being sold.
Today we reported fourth quarter earnings per share excluding specified items of $0.71 above our previous guidance range due to the full year effect of the U.S.
tax legislation enacted in December including the R&amp;D tax credit for 2014.
Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 29% in the fourth quarter.
We saw strong operational sales growth and increasing sales momentum in the fourth quarter.
Sales from continuing operations increased 10.2% on an operational basis in the quarter which include the impact on our recent CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm acquisitions.
Operational sales excluding these acquisitions increased 6.5% in the quarter.
The product sales increased 5.6% in the quarter including an impact of 4.6% from foreign exchange.
The negative impact of foreign exchange on sales is almost twice as high as the estimates we provided in October reflecting strengthening in the U.S.
dollar versus almost every currency during the quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in nutrition diagnostics and established pharmaceuticals.
Own company sales in emerging markets increased strong double-digitss on an operational basis in the quarter.
fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ration was 56.9% of sales ahead of our previous guidance reflecting underlying gross margin improvements across the businesses as well as the impact of the weaker euro on our manufacturing cost base.
Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses 29.5% of sales and adjusted R&amp;D investment was 6.4% of sales.
The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was below our previous forecast due entirely for the inclusion of the full year impact of the U.S.
tax legislation enacted in December as I mentioned earlier.
Overall as we look at 2014 we delivered a strong EPS growth above our initial guidance range and up more than 13% versus the prior year.
Adjusted EPS from continuing operations grew 21%.
We continue to make significant progress in our margin improvement initiatives spanning our full year adjusted operation margins in continuing operations by 200 basis points.
And importantly we exited the year with strong underlying momentum as we head into 2015.
As I turn to our outlook for 2015 I'd note that as detailed in our earnings release in 2014 we achieved adjusted EPS from continuing operations $1.98.
This was the new baseline against which we will be measuring EPS growth in 2015.
As Miles indicated the recent strengthening of the U.S.
dollar is negatively impacting our 2015 growth as it is from our multinational companies.
Based on current exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange on our sales will be even more pronounced in 2015 than it was last year with a negative impact on 2015 sales growth of around 6% compared to 2.5% for the full year 2014.
Although the impact of currency will be significant in 2015 it is important to note that as I mentioned earlier we exited last year with strong underlying performance momentum.
Our top line operational growth accelerated significantly in the second half of the year as expected and we continue to make substantial progress on our margin expansion initiatives.
Importantly the underlying trends across the key geographies and healthcare segments in which we compete remain positive and attractive over the long term driven by improving access in healthcare and demographic trends that aligns our business.
So despite recent currency dynamics we are well positioned to deliver strong EPS growth in 2015.
So turning to the specifics of our outlook for the full year 2015 today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations of $2.10 to $2.20 which reflects the growth of around 8.5% over 2014.
At current exchange rates currency would negatively impact 2015 EPS growth reflected in this guidance by around 10%.
We forecast operational sales growth continuing operations in the high single-digit for the full year 2015.
As noted at current exchange rates we would expect negative impact of around 6% on our full year reported sales which will result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2015.
Brian will provide more detail on the 2015 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57% of sales for the full year 2015 reflecting more than 150 basis points of expansion driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses.
I'll note that at current exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange on our gross margin ratio is expected to be relatively neutral in 2015 as the impact of exchange on sales will be largely offset by the benefit we will realize from the weaker euro on our European based manufacturing costs.
We forecast adjusted R&amp;D investment as a percent of sales consistent with 2014 level at around 6.5% of sales.
And we forecast adjusted SG&amp;A expense around 31% of sales for the full year as we end up some of savings from our efficiency programs and new products across our businesses to drive top line growth.
Overall we expect to expand our full year adjusted operating margin by over 100 basis points in 2015 reflecting another year of significant margin expansion.
We forecast interest expense of around $150 million up over 2014 due to a planned refinancing of a portion of our short term debt and expectation of higher U.S.
short term interest rates impacting short term debt in the second half of the year and somewhat lower interest income as a result of the funding 2014 acquisitions.
We forecast adjusted tax rate of 19% for the full year 2015 which is in line with the normalized 2014 rate excluding the effect of the U.S.
tax legislation enacted in December.
Our forecast does not assume reenactment of the U.S.
R&amp;D tax credit in 2015.
Finally I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter of 2015.
For the first quarter we forecast adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.41 to $0.43 which reflects growth of over 23% the midpoint of the range over adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2014 up $0.34.
This strong growth even in the line of currency headwinds is driven by strong underlying performance as well as favorable year-over-year comparisons due to certain items of reduced sales and earnings in the first quarter of last year including the carry over effects of the 2013 supplier recall nutrition the planning of a plant swept out in EPD to expand capacity and reimbursement changes affecting our U.S.
diabetes business.
For the second third and fourth quarters while we forecast strong underlying adjusted EPS growth this performance will be partially offset by the significant impact of foreign exchange on EPS growth in each quarter of the year.
This will result in adjusted EPS growth in the mid or mid upper single-digits depending on the quarter over the last three quarter in 2015 as we work through the exchange headwinds that began in late 2014.
Returning to our first quarter forecast we project operational sales growth in the high single-digit in the current exchange rates we would expect a negative impact in exchange approaching 7% resulting in reported sales growth in the low single-digits.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat about 57% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense somewhat about 34% of sales consistent with a relatively higher ratio we typically experience in the first quarter and reflecting investments and growth initiatives.
We forecast adjusted R&amp;D investments of around 6.5% of sales net interest expense of around $30 million and around $20 million of income in exchange gain of non-operating income line in the P&amp;L.
In summary we delivered another year of strong adjusted EPS growth in 2014 exceeding our initial guidance range and exited the year with strong momentum including sequential improvements and operational sales growth each quarter of the year and significant operating margin expansion.
This strong underlying performance and momentum positions us well to deliver durable growth in 2015 despite a challenging currency environment.
Our 2015 outlook reflects top tier ongoing growth driven by high single-digit operational sales growth and continued operating margin expansion.
And with that I'll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook.
All right.
Thank you Tom.
This morning I will review our fourth quarter 2014 performance and 2015 sales outlook by business.
As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I will start with our nutrition business where global sales increased 9% in the fourth quarter.
in our international pediatric nutrition business sales increased 14%.
We continue to capture market share with new infant formula products including Similac QINTI and Eleva and which we launched in China during 2014 to further enhance competitive position in our role of end market segments.
International adult nutrition sales increased 13% in the quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in this business.
As we continue to expand the adult nutrition category internationally.
Earlier this month we launched our Ensure brand in China.
Although we expect modest sales initially the adult nutrition market in china represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for Abbott.
The aging population is expected to growth to four times the size of the U.S.
baby boomer population.
In the United States pediatric nutrition sales were relatively flat in the quarter and in line with our expectations.
As share gains in the non segment of the infant formula market will offset by lower sales in the weak segment.
Adult nutrition sales in the U.S.
were impacted by volume and rice dynamics in the institutional segment and by stockists in our pharmacy nutrition business.
For the full year 2015 we will continue to focus on capturing market share with recently launched infant nutrition products and expanding the adult nutrition category internationally including developing a shape in the adult nutrition market in China.
We are forecasting high single-digits growth on an operational basis in our global nutrition business with double-digits operational sales growth in international nutrition.
For the first quarter we expect global nutrition business to deliver mid to high single-digit sales growth on an operational basis.
In our diagnostics business sales increased 8.6% in the fourth quarter with sales in emerging markets growing double-digitss.
Core laboratory diagnostic sales also increased 8.6% with high single-digit growth in both the U.S.
and internationally as we continue to build momentum with our commercial models.
We are also expanding our testing menu in order to provide greater value to clinical laboratories and ultimately patients.
In the first quarter Additionally a study on our high sensitive troponin test previously launched on Architect generated new data that was recently published in the British Medical Journal.
The study found that average test can precisely measure very low levels of troponin which may help doctors accurately diagnose twice as many heart attacks in women compared to standard troponin tests.
In molecular diagnostics sales increased 4.4% in the quarter.
Our infectious disease business which is our core focus and represents more than half of our molecular diagnostic sales increased double-digitss in the quarter.
This growth was partially offset by decline in the oncology and genetics businesses in the U.S.
resulting from pricing and market channel dynamics.
As Miles mentioned in December we received European approval for IRIDICA infectious disease testing platform.
IRIDICA is a first of its kind platform that more rapidly diagnosed serious infections such as sepsis and pneumonia in clinically old patients and has the potential to lower associated healthcare costs by up to 30%.
In point-of-care diagnostics worldwide sales increased 14% as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets.
The point-of-care business had a considerably strong fourth quarter in the U.S.
due in part to customers ordering Abbott's i-STAT analyzers as part of their ebola preparedness activities.
In addition a major hospital network in the U.S.
standardized its point-of-care testing around Abbott's market leading i-STAT platform which also contributed to strong growth in the fourth quarter.
We expect another year of durable performance in our diagnostics business in 2015.
But we continue to execute on our commercial model and core laboratory diagnostics drive uptake of our new IRIDICA infectious disease platform and molecular diagnostics in Europe and increase market penetration with our point-of-care platforms.
At the same time we continue development of our next generation platforms across all three businesses.
These systems are being designed to positively impact patient care improved service to customers enhanced laboratory productivity and reduced costs.
For the full year 2015 we expect our global diagnostics business to generate operational growth that is similar to our performance in 2014.
For the first quarter global diagnostics we're forecasting low to mid single-digit operational sales growth.
In medical devices we completed the acquisition of Topera in the fourth quarter.
Topera provides Abbott with a foundational entry in the $3 billion fast growing electrophysiology markets.
Its breakthrough technology can transform how physicians treat people with complex heart rhythm disorders.
Our vascular business increased 1.7% in the quarter representing a sequential improvement versus the third quarter of 2014 and somewhat above our previous guidance.
In our structural heart business we continue to see strong double-digits sales growth of MitraClip our breakthrough technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation.
Our endovascular business also generated double-digits growth in the quarter driven by our Supera peripheral stent for the superficial femoral artery or SFA.
In November we presented long term Supera data that demonstrate a very strong freedom from target lesion revascularization rate of 94% at three years.
In the first quarter we launched our new drug-eluting stent system XIENCE Alpine in the US.
XIENCE Alpine is the only drug-eluting stent with an indication to treat chronic total occlusions.
We've recently received XIENCE Alpine regulatory approval in Japan and expect to launch in the next few months following reimbursement approval.
We are also making regulatory progress with our bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB which we expect to submit for approval in the U.S.
China and Japan by the end of this year.
These three geographies represent more than 50% of the world's coronary stent market.
For the full year and first quarter 2015 we expect sales in our global vascular business to increase modestly on an operational basis.
In diabetes care global sales in the fourth quarter were down mid single-digits in line with our expectations as the rate of decline in the U.S.
is moderate following the U.S.
reimbursement changes that were enacted in the middle of 2013.
Outside the United States we launched our revolutionary new glucose testing technology FreeStyle Libre direct to consumers.
With the launch of FreeStyle Libre we expect our global diabetes business to return to low single-digit growth on an operational basis in 2015.
For the first quarter we're also forecasting low single-digits operational sales growth in our diabetes care business.
In medical optics sales increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter and 8.5% for the full year.
Sales of our cataract products which represent approximately 70% of our medical optics business increased high single-digits globally in the quarter.
This growth is partially offset by market declines in the refracted and corneal segments of the medical optics business.
In 2015 we look forward to multiple new product launches across a number of key geographies as well as continued penetration of our CATALYS laser cataract system.
The first of these new products our TECNIS multifocal Low Add premium intraocular lens which provides more range of vision options to patients and surgeons will soon launch in the U.S.
For the full year 2015 we expect our global medical optics business to grow mid to high single-digits on an operational basis with more to mid single-digit growth in the first quarter.
And lastly our established pharmaceuticals business or EPD where sales from continuing operations excluding the developed market branded generics pharmaceuticals business increased strong double-digitss in the quarter.
As Miles mentioned we completed the acquisitions of CFR and Veropharm last year but at the same time generated strong underlying performance from our EPD emerging market business.
Excluding the sales contributions from acquisitions organic sales increased nearly 9.5% in the quarter.
This performance was driven by double-digitss sales growth across several emerging geographies including India Russia and China.
For the full year 2015 we expect continued strong double-digit growth in EPD on an operational basis including the impact of acquisitions as this business continues to expand product portfolios in key therapeutic areas implements new branding initiatives across the portfolio and increases its focus on marketing to the pharmacy channels.
Excluding the contributions from our acquisitions made in 2014 we expect high single-digit operational sales growth in EPD for the full year 2015.
For the first quarter we're also forecasting strong double-digits growth in EPD on an operational basis including the impact of acquisitions.
So in summary we achieved our expectations in 2014.
Sales growth improved sequentially every quarter this year.
We exceeded our earnings per share expectations.
We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points and we completed several actions to continue to position Abbott for durable growth.
As we look ahead to 2015 we are well positioned to deliver sequential improvement in operational sales growth and another year of top gear earning per share growth.
We will now open the call for questions.
Good morning and thanks for taking the questions guys.
Let me touch maybe on two topics.
So the first and Tom could you talk a little bit more about FX the impact on 2015 and how should we think about your ability to manage through additional dollar strengthening going forward? I pretty much covered that in my remarks.
You know we talked about 6% based on current rates on the top line and there's about 10% headwind on our earnings growth year-over-year.
Historically as I have told you that follow us know within any one year we've done a pretty good job of managing through what I call normal fluctuations in currency and really it has not affected our performance against our expectations and going forward from this point something in the major moves have happened.
We would expect something similar in 2015.
I think what everyone has seen in this season is that there are limits that there are major major moves but I'd say anything within the normal levels of fluctuations we continue to do what we've done in the past.
Mike I would add to that.
We may have an unusual mix of currencies relative to what multinationals for us for example the euro is not an impact because we just happen to have enough cost manufacturing and other things in Europe that it pretty much self hedges.
So as we look forward at the year we're not more uncertain currencies might be to euro that won't affect us.
We're pretty protected on that.
And a rather back handed I guess bit a good fortune I don’t really accept the Rubel to impact us very much because it already did and it already impacted us pretty significantly in 2014.
So when we look forward at the particular currencies that are most likely you know to be volatile or might have risk and I have no corner on crystal ball here to know what’s going to happen certainly no one would have projected any of things that happened this last year.
I think that we are likely or possibly going to see volatility in FX we are in a pretty good position.
And so we don’t anticipate it impacting us like a good thumb and we have already had the impact for PN and others and observe that and we are going to the year with a little bit of cushion and contingencies just in case.
So I think we are probably in good places we have ever been in spite of how heavy headwind is of FX in general for all countries.
The strategic question you exit 2014 with the underlying businesses in really good shape obviously not all pieces are doing as well as you would like but not aggregate and it looks very strong obviously a lot stronger than it did 12 18 months ago.
So what are the strategic priorities and in particularly in the context of your balance sheet and what is your balance sheet could like so that you monetize your mile to take over the next several months? Well I assume that course would come up at some point.
My first priority is to get the deal closed and you may know that there are several concludes today but we've had some really good news here in the last week in terms of your approval for the deal and so forth.
So I expect to get that closed pretty quickly here.
You know I don’t want to forecast where or what we might be looking at our considering.
I do want to add that to business.
I do want to add to the company in places where we either want to expand our footprint or can certainly expand the strength of our footprint you know that telegraphing where that might be I mean as you know I don’t if telegraphs post things ahead a time and yet we have been pretty consistent at the kinds of things we are interested in.
I think we got a lot of capacity and you know presuming that everything concludes properly here with our mile and transaction we have got a lot of flexibility and a lot of capacity and I think I want to make good strategic deals that are prudent.
I think that a little more difficulty these days.
It's not difficult to be prudent.
It's difficult to find a lot of good opportunities and if it fit a lot of price tags up there have very ambitious expectation and I don’t think it has rich robust and emanating environment as we see in other years.
But having said that I would like to still see plenty of opportunities for us to expand and add to the business and just question of right timing right receptivity on the other side great values and finance some overlap.
The good news is I think you want to really add to a sound foundation.
And you know sometimes if you do MNA to patch you know something that’s not working in the core of the company then they will always work that well and we have a lot of disintegration to get through here separating from ABT pretty much concluded get in close.
We have got the same thing where we can work through on the EPD develop market business.
You know your organization ready for the integration of whatever you have made do have a bigger or small it may be and I think we are in a good place were the underlying performance where all the businesses is really good.
You are right there is places that I would rather see better commercial performance but overall very stable and some organization have the other task and distractions pretty much concluded so we could not be more ready and position better with good strong balance sheet.
Having said that I know it does not give you any sort of indication of where what and when etc but we are obviously looking something.
And Mile a comment about targets ideally with the cash you are going to have outside the U.S.
in the balance sheet as an ideal target would be outside the U.S.
and other low shortage of target for you outside the US do you see opportunities there? I see a lot of targets outside the US.
A lot of them have a very high valuation and expectations that are you know I think a little unrealistic in some cases but you know on the grand scheme of things that is just negotiation.
I think there is a lot of I think the external next to the U.S.
is in a fashion not quite target rich but there is a lot of that can be done to expand our business and our presence in a number of key countries.
I don’t rule out the U.S.
I think that there is still opportunity in U.S.
it's just a lot more selective and obviously financially speaking it’s a lot easier to build cash that’s outside the U.S.
where there is a going to be a lot of and that’s a lot easier.
You know under today’s tax regimen so it's more -- probably a more attractive environment and a lot of our monitoring and you know hunting if you will is outside the U.S.
The good news is we have been in these countries outside the U.S.
a long time.
And we know them reasonably well.
You know a lot of cases the kinds of businesses that we are interested in outside the US or family owner or family sponsored a little different environment in the U.S.
or European markets but we are comfortable there.
We are comfortable navigating there.
We have had a fair amount of experience there and that is a plus plus.
I think during the last couple of years we have been accomplish some pretty unique and unusual acquisitions I think it was pretty unusual particularly given that we were well into it when the Ukraine issues happened and made it more difficult and I would say I would path CFO for us to go and back here for having the presence of mind to do this deal in Rubles.
So we were not exposed to exchange on that particular deal.
I think it’s a fabulous deal for us long term in Russia and that’s an important market for us and we anticipated that we did not wish for and the evaluation of Rubles we were prepared for it.
So I think there is a number of places where there is opportunities for outside the U.S.
but there aren’t necessarily that’s is visible to U.S.
investors or U.S.
analysts I know you know that but there is a lot out there that enhances what we are trying to do with the business and what we believe the growth opportunities are where we can leverage the already existing infrastructure we have.
Perfect.
Thank you.
Mile.
I will let some others jump in.
Hi.
Thanks for taking the question.
If we could just focus on the margins and the underlying performance what stands out the most to me is just the guidance in terms of the EPS being up 8.5% at the midpoint despite a 10% FX head wind.
Can you maybe just walk through the confidence in the underlying margin expansion and then also just touch on the fourth-quarter gross margin because that came in much better than we were anticipating.
I’ll make a couple of comments about it Kristen.
I’ll hand it over to Tom for little more color here.
First of all I think we got we had a head start here because with the separation of FB as we have said in past calls we took a very comprehensive look at our G&amp;A costs and our underlying costs in manufacturing and other things across the company and we have initiatives in all of our divisions pointed at that for some time and we have had some very good success with improvement of costs and improvement of expenses in the company in a variety of ways.
And I highlighted nutrition and diagnostics as to that standout where we have tremendous improvement in underlying cost structure.
The unfortunate thing is that given the exchange rates that multinational have experienced from on and so forth some of that has been chewed up or at least that improvement in our costs and expense structure has protected us from erosion from exchange and it continues to.
Ideally we want to keep improving those costs overtime which we believe we can but the biggest costs we have had has been exchanged and I don’t think that you do see in the top line.
The good news is in a lot of cases we have cost structure and our expense structure distributed among the countries where we have the high sales and profit and so it does offset to some degree the impact of exchange on the sales line.
And what we will see is when it hurts the sales line it improves the gross margin.
It is just offsetting so part of the improvement that you have seen in our gross margin is being in the right places when exchange so that we can mitigate the impact on our profits and we got a big head start on that two years ago when we splint.
So we have been well prepared to sort of observe what's happening and it would have been our intent to have much higher earnings but in fact it has observed the impact and kept as a performance level that’s really good but we could have hoped for more had it not been for that.
Tom do you want to give some more color on that.
I’ll just add a couple of things recall when we announced the ETD develop market transaction we said that the underlying growth have rate of ABT was about 2% better on a continuing operations basis and once before so certainly that is giving a little more rooms to our growth than what you might have expected.
I think the other thing and it’s a really all about the manufacturing margin there are gross margin that Miles alluded to.
The last two years we have had relatively flat gross margin and what we have been saying is that has been in spite of the really strong costs improvement programs Miles talked about because the currency was hurting our gross margin but that was because the year was strong and that was keeping our costs for that particular large manufacturing cost base up pretty high.
But now the year was moving with the other currencies and the real benefit of the real actions in our manufacturing plants and our operations people are really starting to show through the gross margin now that the Euro is matching where the other currencies are going in direction line.
So I think those are a couple of differences that really are the bases for our relatively stronger EPS growth rate in '15 than you might be seeing from other companies.
Make no mistake.
If weren’t all of us facing some of the currency headwinds earnings would be even stronger.
And I guess just in light of all the portfolio moves how do you look at longer-term growth? Do you feel very well positioned in the mid to high single digit and it certainly sounds like double-digit EPS growth forecast? Well its always our intent to be in that range and do better and I feel pretty good about that I say this would caution because I would not have predicted the things that happened in the latter half of the year in 2014 and I don’t think there is many people that would have predicted what happened in 2014 toward the end of the year either in what happened with the price of oil what happened with interest rates what happened with exchange rates etcetera.
so that’s it all things be equal.
Yes I expect that we can maintain healthy high single digit sales growth rate and double digit bottom line growth rate that’s our intense that’s are goal we think that’s kind of identity and expectations of a company and so every year at every LRP every long range plan is sort of built around the expectation of maintenance of that and we have always got sort of long term view of where we believe those growth and share opportunities are.
And I say so far so good I don’t see any reason to accept less.
And just to clarify you said high single digit sales or mid to high.
Mid to high.
To be clear.
I am always pushing for more in reality today mid is pretty good and I can remember when mid was a disaster and today mid looks pretty good and I guess if the market the world all of us are doing well then everything looks good but I think we target that range.
If we steadily or in that mid to high range we are going to be targeting high.
And if we are steadily in the high range we are going to be targeting double.
It's going to be always wanting to do a little better than may be a lot better than what the market gives you.
Prefect.
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
Good morning everybody.
I wanted to start on the U.S.
as obviously markets outside the United States were very strong for you in the quarter.
But maybe you could just talk a little bit broadly about your U.S.
franchises particularly in the context of what looks to have been a better operating environment domestically whether it's what we are seeing out of the hospitals or some of the other volume-related companies.
How do you think about the evolution of your US franchise in 2015 and beyond? I think the U.S.
first of all very important market it's such a big market.
It's our largest market and three of our major business are large and important here.
And one the established pharmaceutical business is not here at all in U.S.
I would say it's interesting to me most shareholders and analyst that I listen to today or hear from will tell me the US is better relative to what.
I don’t think that the health care environment or health care products companies in the U.S.
are that much better to be honest.
I don’t think it’s a robust market.
I think it’s a reaction to the kind of sudden volatility that lot of companies have experienced outside the U.S.
and we tend to like predictability in this country and we tend to like our predictability in quarterly doses.
But I look at the market for long term and I think what the U.S.
is a health market it’s important for products but I don’t consider it in our businesses a particularly robust growth market and that means as we look at the U.S.
our expectations to be in good single digit range and remain profitable and health here but the real growth even this volatile market a worldwide is outside the U.S.
For I think for health care products for pharmaceuticals for devices for the products that were in I think the growth rates are much better outside the US we just have to navigate the volatility of that means.
And in that case there is probably 15 countries around the world may be 20 depending on what company you are that are important in varying degrees as growth opportunities market development opportunities etc and if those economies are developing or recovering as the case may be I think the underlying fundamentals of growth of those market succeed the U.S.
That doesn’t mean the U.S.
is best.
I think the U.S.
is better than it has been but it has not been particularly good so better is easy it's a little hurdle and while we say the U.S.
is more solid today I think the U.S.
today is in certainly a growth market it’s just a lot more stable and predictable than a lot of markets around the world.
Do you guys want to add to that? No I’ll just say even as we look at 2015 where in currency side again we are looking growth rates you know 2 to 3 4X what the US is and it underscores minus points that’s where the growth is but we do see improvements in some of our U.S.
businesses in 2015.
Diagnostics is continued to be a pretty good performance relative to the lower growth market and you ADC is now moving better into better territory and we do ask them to new product activity in vascular which can help you grow-up from slow growth market and things like MitraClip and Supera and XIENCE Alpine are going to help us do a little better in that business in 2015.
But the relative growth rate I just tackle with what Mile said there is no comparison and that’s why we have pursued and invested more in these higher growth markets.
I’ll say what is coming in the US and its frankly is a good for any company around the world in any country but here in the U.S.
you are not going to get a lot of tailwind growth.
So you better be prepared to innovate and slug it up for share.
And you got to look it at that way that you got win you got to be the competitor you cannot just take a tailwind.
We got keep improving our products and got to keep putting up better products and gain our share that way.
The thing I am heartened by is when I look across all of our business in the vision in their R&amp;D pipeline and the products that are bringing whether are incremental innovation or may be substantial innovation like Libre in our diabetes care business they are really good products and they really will make a difference and they really will drive share gain and growth.
That actually I look forward to as a real positive here for the next two to five years as we keep bringing out more and more new products.
It keeps us and makes us more competitive in markets like the US.
Frankly the reverse side of that is in markets where you got a tailwind of growth.
You tend be a sharp in terms of competitiveness because you are getting that tailwind growth and it’s actually a health for us to be both ways and we will get the benefit of our new products and new innovations in all markets.
Okay that's a helpful perspective.
Maybe just a follow-up on some of the questions around M&amp;A and strategic vision here.
I think the language that you have used in the past couple calls is looking at Reshape Abbott in 2014 was obviously a busy year in that regard.
Can you maybe give us some more perspective on Reshape Abbott into what? What is the long-term vision here given all the moving parts? Are we looking at this as a four-legged stool for a sustainable period of time? Is the mix of business one that makes sense? Ultimately when you are done with that reshaping what do you want Abbott to look like? I want the foundation we have got.
I like the four legged that we have that we want to describe on this four legs.
We talked off and on from time to time about whether something is truly a fifth leg or whether a leg four current structure for example.
A lot of people would not necessarily see the brand and generic pharmaceutical business than they are efficient business as related but truthfully oversees they go through all the same channel they go through the same wholesales they go through the same retail outlet they go through the same pharmaceutical or pharmacies and so forth.
And so they are spreading they are very consumer facing in the markets and targets we focused on and so there is a lot of call it brand synergy and customer synergy and consumer synergy among them.
So those are plusses for us.
And we are not in - although than non nutrition business and in a way our brand of generic business we are not fully in the OTC business.
But I will use it as a wide example because if someone brings me in a opportunity here that say look it’s got this - by the way it’s got OTC which is rejected with the OTC.
Well you know I wouldn’t in some countries.
Does that mean I'm looking for that in order to try to compete with P&amp;G in the U.S.
no I'm not but if in a country like India where the overlap of OTX OTC branded generic Pharma and nutrition is such that that was a extension opportunity it would strategically fit really well with our infrastructure in India.
So I would say kind of the pen and I think we’re much stronger when we can add to businesses we already know and already understand the operating models and know how we can leverage both the business the brands infrastructure et cetera much like we are -- we see it far in Latin America.
I want to be cautious not to roll out opportunities that I think are long term expansions for us.
I look at medical optics.
When we made that acquisition number of years ago well there was some criticism that -- gee that's far afield for you.
It isn’t it’s not a nice strong growth drive for us what I would add to it I would.
If I see the right opportunities and the right circumstances so I think the related businesses here they all have a couple of things in common.
They are all in growing markets.
They are all innovation driven.
They are all durable.
They are durable in terms of growth rates and I compare that to the funnel business that we used to be.
Pharma it’s a fabulous business.
If you get all the way to the finish line and launch the product and it’s a risky business it’s a science so risky with pharmaceuticals.
And so it’s a different business model.
Without the pharmaceutical business that particular pharmaceutical business which has been tremendously successful separate from Abbott we are more of a durable growth company.
A lot of people would interpret durable a number of different ways.
I think at least mid to high single digit growth I think it’s not particularly volatile in terms of patterns exploration and so forth although it might benefit from IPU like our wise business doing.
But it’s got a certain stability to it but also growth and innovation driven.
And I think that the long term identity of Abbott has been to be growth to be relatively reliable to be real growth and to return cash et cetera to shareholders as it grows.
And that’s been the identity of the company for a long time.
I think the mix of countries and products that were in delivers that identity without a lot of harsh volatility.
And I think an example would be the environment we’re in right now.
If we can weather 2014 and 2015 with what’s happening in the world economies and in the world markets and so forth and deliver the results we’re delivering I think we are absolutely living up to the identity of a very reliable durable profitable growth company.
And that’s what this mix of business is a mix of geographies does.
And I think it’s a bit of unique that way.
But I think that’s the intent of what we are trying to do whether there is room for a fifth or sixth leg in there I think it depends.
And I think we take our opportunities as they come we know what we’re good at we know what we’re not good at or don’t know about.
If we’re looking at some acquisition or business to add to the company my first question is can we add to it? And so we do better because it’s in our hand and I think that’s a critical threshold for us to hold ourselves to as we invest shareholder money.
Thank you.
I appreciate all the perspective and congrats on a good quarter and first start to 2015.
Good morning.
I just want to come back to guidance for a quick second.
I think the numbers were largely in line with many expectations.
But the revenue outlook has been I think more bullish this morning.
And I think the stock is reacting to that.
Either for Miles or Tom or Brian thinking about this year if you can get acceleration you have more difficult comps versus 2014 as the business improved in the back half of 2014.
We talked a lot about emerging market currency but there may be emerging market weakness investors are concerned about.
So the first question is just what provides the confidence that you can get that incremental acceleration and be very confident in that revenue number? Is it products is it specific segments? And where does that momentum reside that even in the face of EM and the face of strengthening comps you feel pretty confident that you can deliver this top-line number.
And then I have a quick follow up.
Let me give a couple of comments and I'll hand it back to Brian and Tom to add.
There is a number of moving parts here.
The first thing that I would say is we look at the underlying growth of the businesses some of them are very strong stronger than you might see some countries have stabilized and turned more positive - India as an example when it has last year.
So there is some underlying strengths here that comes from a variety of sources number one.
Number two and there is still somewhat I like to see do better.
Number two there is the lapping of various events or uneven miss in the quarterly reporting.
So for example you recall last year in the first half of the year we were lapping a recall from the prior year which surpassed the first and second quarter of 2014 which enhances the comparison for 2015.
So we’ve got some of that up and down in here as well.
We have the launch of some new products.
We have two acquisitions in here that weren’t there before that particularly effect the last half of the year CFR and Veropharm.
There will be two subtractions from the company which will also effect that quarter-over-quarter comparison established from developed market business will be out of the mix.
So when you change the mix of the pieces and the growth rates of the various pieces when it all comes together it actually looks like what we forecasted and makes sense.
It’s just there is a lot of moving parts and I think it probably is not that easy for investors to tease those apart put them back together and so what it all will -- and I'm very confident in it.
David this is Brian.
And I would say just as like foreign exchange I think what’s going on in the companies definitely in different ways.
You take for example what’s going in with respect to the price of oil.
There were actually countries who benefit from this and you see that pass all the way down through their GDP and also way to the consumer.
And as Miles talked about being a more consumer base company clearly this has planned out very nicely in the countries for example of China and India who are net importers of oil we are seeing very good performance by our nutrition business particularly with the launch of the products Similac QINTI that I referenced as well as Eleva.
Recall we just turned on promotion there towards the end of 2014 and I would add that China as well we’ve not only recovered to baseline we’ve gone beyond share.
So for all signs pointing positive there.
David let me add one more thing to it.
Clearly under the circumstances in the last four weeks when so many companies have identified the currency risk that everybody is feeling and the currency hit that everybody feeling and the oil sand that many are feeling and the impact of that on tertiary markets and so forth.
A lot of people are necessarily to report that’s it going to impact their business.
And with all that different business in that environment I would have to say it’s tempting to reset the bar lower.
We look at that and said no we are not going to reset our bar lower it’s not because it’s hard for us to stretch to do it if you want to be transparently reliable growth company as we are and we are already dealing with always adjusting educating our investors about the variety of emerging markets when and so forth.
I think it is important for us to be true of what we are going to do and this is what we think we’re going to do.
I mean there was a temptation that buy a little conservatism here and estimate lower and beat.
We may bit anyway but I didn’t want to take that opportunities to set lower so I'm confident in these numbers I'm confident in the earnings projection I think our mix is different than others I think as I pointed out earlier we are just not vulnerable to the euro and a lot of companies are.
And based on the forecast there I don’t have the same issues.
So our earnings turn out where they are.
Okay.
Just one quick question.
I am loathe to ask another balance sheet M&amp;A question but I am just going to ask it and hate myself the rest of the week.
Miles one of the hallmarks of how you approached M&amp;A was to basically fix exposure.
You have obviously had this nutritional asset which is great exposure.
You've increased your exposure to the part of the pharmaceutical business that you want and decreased your exposure to the part you didn't want.
I wonder if you can talk about the consumer more broadly.
Is getting access or getting exposure to the consumer or steam or something we could expect out of the company in coming quarters and years? Yes but for reasons different than just exposure to the consumer I would say we've intentionally wanted to change the mix of the company to outsource sales and profit etcetera that wasn’t necessarily as reliant on government reimbursement.
We wanted a greater mix of patient pay or consumer pay and I would rather ride with the consumer markets than ride with the volatility of say Europe where it's heavily heavily reimbursement driven and given the economic issues that most European countries in the EU faces you are at the whim of the next stroke of the pen to cut prices.
So wanted a different mix and we wanted a different geographic mix we wanted a different balance in how much we're reliant on payers how much we're reliant on government and how much we're reliant on the consumer or the patient themselves.
So that drove some of the choice around geography and/or business areas that we believe make up a durable growth company.
We also find that the predictable growth in profitability of countries that are -- or businesses that are more patient pay is frankly more reliable than those that at least for us are susceptible to reimbursement cuts etcetera.
So it doesn’t mean we don't want to in countries that are reimbursement driven we do.
It's a matter of balance.
It's a matter of mix.
It's a matter of timing have it but not too much.
Okay.
We'll have time for one more question operator please.
Good morning.
Thanks for fitting me in.
Just a couple quick clarification questions for Tom and then one product-related question from Miles.
On EPS I just wanted to confirm the FX hit the 10 percentage point hit.
So at the midpoint constant currency would be about 235 Tom? Yes 10% of our $0.20 so that's part right Larry.
And then the contribution from acquisitions implied in the high single-digit constant currency growth for 2015 we have about 4%.
Closer to 3.5% Larry.
3.5%.
Okay.
And that includes that's net of divestitures Tom? Divestitures are already out of the numbers because of our continuing operation.
So that should be comparable between the years.
Got it.
Then just lastly for me Miles on Libre if you could talk about your excitement for that product how big you think it can be and your long-term strategy in atrial fibrillation a new market for you.
I am sure people would be interested to hear your long-term strategy there.
Thanks.
Okay.
First of all on Libre I am excited about the product.
I think it's a great innovation a great product.
I think we've had really good customer response and I guess our challenge right now is capacity expansion.
And I would say that's the limiting factor for us quicker faster sooner than we expected and so the organizations kept the blow torch going to expand capacity because I think that product particularly as word of mouth spreads among patients is going to be very strong.
I am frustrated with the pace of regulatory approval in the U.S.
but nevertheless right now we know the capacity anyways.
So it's open to a really good reception in Europe and I expect it's going to be a real positive product for us in that sector.
On the electrophysiology front I don't want to create higher expectations there because everybody is going to tell me we're entering land of the giants and so forth.
I think it's a great segment.
I think there is a lot of opportunity for advancement of technology there to make a real and improved impact on the treatment of the patient.
People see it as a $3 billion market today.
I think it's going to be a bigger market a much bigger market over time and I think there is a lot of room for technology innovation there.
We've invested in not only to play but a number of other companies from an equity standpoint to bring along and we have a long term view of how we want to play in that market which I don't want to detail here.
But we're going to take a run at it and see what can be accomplished there.
Thanks for taking the questions guys.

Welcome to Abbott’s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call.
[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.
With the exception of any participant’s questions asked during the question-and-answer session the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott’s expressed written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr.
Brian Yoor Vice President Investor Relations.
Okay good morning and thank you for joining us.
With me today are Miles White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail.
Following our comments Miles Tom and I will take your questions.
Before we get started some statements made today maybe forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the expected financial results for 2015.
Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
Economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1(a) Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2014.
Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.
Please note that first quarter and guidance provided today on the call for sales earnings per share and line items of the P&amp;L will be for continuing operations only.
In today's conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott’s ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Okay thanks Brian good morning everybody.
I will be brief this morning and leave some time for questions.
Our first-quarter performance exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines and we reported double-digit operational sales growth exceeded both our gross and operating margin targets in the quarter closed on the sale of our EPD developed markets business to Mylan and launched a number of new products across our portfolio.
I will summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Tom and Brian for some further detail.
Operational sales increased 10% in the quarter with particularly strong performance in our branded generics international nutrition and global diagnostics businesses as well as double-digit growth in emerging markets and that did include the additions of CFR and Veropharm.
While currency was a factor including a 7% negative impact on the top line we continue to manage through its effect on the bottom line.
Our first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.47 exceeds our previous guidance range and reflects growth of 38% but again as I said that includes the addition of CFR and Veropharm in comparisons.
Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth excluding the impact of currency.
So in the quarter starting with nutrition sales increased more than 6% with continued double-digit growth outside of the United States.
The new pediatric products that we have launched into China and other fast growing geographies are continuing to perform well.
Products like Similac QINTI and Eleva and we have got strong performance in the online segment.
These new products drive share expansion and contribute to our growth in the market.
The international adult nutrition business has consistently delivered high single digit to double-digit sales growth.
Our adult nutritional Ensure is roughly a $2 billion brand globally today and we launched it into the retail segment in China earlier this year.
In March we also opened a nutrition pilot plant in Singapore.
This facility in addition to the others there allows us to customize more of our products to meet consumer preferences across Asia.
In medical devices diabetes care returned to growth this quarter as we expected.
We have had a very positive early response to the launch of our new FreeStyle Libre device.
As I mentioned last quarter we are already expanding capacity to meet this demand.
Libre is a highly differentiated technology that helps people self-manage their diabetes without the need for routine fingersticks.
We are also building a portfolio of products based on our sensor technology and FreeStyle Libre Pro is our first professional use device that was launched in India earlier this month.
Our vascular business also performed in line with our expectations.
Operational sales growth in the quarter was driven by high single digit performance of our endovascular products as well as double-digit growth of our structural heart product MitraClip.
The market opportunity for mitral regurgitation is significant but still in its early stages and MitraClip is the only product on the market to date that can treat this disease in a minimally invasive way.
In medical optics sales were impacted by market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses.
We recently launched two new cataract lenses and saw a pickup in our cataract lens growth as the quarter progressed.
In diagnostics we delivered 6% growth in the quarter.
The continued success of our commercial strategies with core laboratory customers are driving share gains in the US and emerging markets.
We continue to invest in the development of next-generation system platforms across all three of our diagnostics businesses.
In point-of-care diagnostics sales increased double digits.
In the US we have had success with large healthcare networks standardizing our point-of-care testing with our i-STAT system.
Outside the US our expansion efforts continue in both developed and emerging geographies.
In established pharmaceuticals we’re executing better commercially.
That is something that I have given a fair amount of attention to on past calls with you.
We are expanding our product portfolios in our therapeutic area of focus – areas of focus and driving more awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers physicians and pharmacists.
Excluding the benefit from our recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm sales in our key emerging markets increased in low double-digit with above market growth in India Brazil China Russia and Colombia.
With the sale of the developed markets business to Mylan completed in February EPD is now focused solely on emerging markets.
We received 110 million shares of Mylan stock for the developed markets business and recently sold roughly a third of our position.
The net proceeds from the sale of Mylan shares and our strong balance sheet provide us with additional flexibility to invest in strategic growth opportunities to continue to shape Abbott for long-term growth.
So in summary we reported first-quarter results ahead of our expectations.
We are building on the momentum we had exiting 2014 and we expect high single-digit full year operational sales growth and continued progress on margin expansion and we are well on track to achieve our financial objectives in 2015.
I will now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss our first quarter results in more detail.
Tom? Thanks Miles.
AsMiles indicated today we reported first-quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.47 above our previous guidance range and reflecting growth of 38%.
Sales for the quarter increased 10% on an operational basis excluding an unfavorable impact of 7% from foreign exchange.
Reported sales increased to 3% in the quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in nutritional diagnostics and established pharmaceuticals which included the impact of 2014 acquisitions.
Sales in emerging markets increased strong double digits in the quarter.
First-quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.1% of sales somewhat above our forecast and up nearly 500 basis points over the first quarter of 2014.
The year-over-year comparison was driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses and in part the comparison relative to an unusually low ratio experienced in the first quarter 2014.
In the quarter adjusted R&amp;D investments was around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expenses were around 34.5% of sales.
The over delivery in the first quarter EPS compared to our guidance was in part the result of the dynamics of exchange on our results including the timing effects of hedging activity on the exchange gain loss line of the P&amp;L.
We expect the first quarter favorability on this line of the P&amp;L to partially reverse in the second quarter with remaining net gains for the year to be offset on the operating income line of the P&amp;L over the last three quarters.
As we discussed last quarter while the weaker euro impacts our top line movements in the euro have a minimal impact on our bottom line due to our euro denominated cost base.
Therefore the further weakening of the Euro that we saw in the first quarter of the year does not impact our 2015 EPS forecast.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015 our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 from continuing operations remains unchanged.
Regarding our full year 2015 outlook for the P&amp;L we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the high single digits.
Based on current exchange rates we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 7% on our full year reported sales up over our previous projected in January of around 6%.
This should result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2015.
Brian will provide more details on the 2015 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We now forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57.5% of sales for the full year driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses.
We forecast adjusted R&amp;D investment of around 6.5% of sales and now forecast an adjusted SG&amp;A expense of around 31.5% of sales.
Overall we continue to expect to expand our full year adjusted operating margin by over 100 basis points in 2015.
We now forecast net interest expense of around $120 million reflecting changes in the interest rate assumptions on both our debt and some of our investment.
We forecast an exchange gain of approximately $35 million on the exchange gain loss line in the P&amp;L for the full year reflecting some reversal of the favorability we saw on this line in the first quarter as mentioned previously and we forecast around $5 million of non-operating expense for the full year 2015.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter we forecast ongoing EPS of $0.49 to $0.51 reflecting double-digit underlying growth largely offset by the impact of segment foreign exchange headwind on operating results as discussed on the January call as well as the partial reversal of favorability in the exchange gain loss line of the P&amp;L from the first quarter as previously mentioned.
We forecast operational sales growth in the low double digits in the second quarter.
At current exchange rates we would expect the negative impact from exchange of somewhat above 8% resulting in reported sales in the low single digits.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57.5% of sales adjusted R&amp;D investment of approximately 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales in the second quarter.
We forecast net interest expense of around $35 million and approximately $15 million in expense on the exchange gain loss line of the P&amp;L.
Finally we project specified items of $0.23 in the second quarter reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release.
So in summary our full year ongoing EPS guidance remains unchanged.
As we start the year we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong EPS growth in 2015 despite a challenging currency environment.
And with that I will turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook.
Brian? Thanks Tom.
This morning I will review our first quarter 2015 performance and second-quarter sales outlook by business.
As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I will start with our nutrition business where global sales increased more than 6% in the first quarter.
In our international pediatric nutrition business sales increased to 11.7% driven by double-digit growth in China and Latin America.
We continued to capture market share with new infant formula products we launched into the fast-growing market segments and geographies over the past year.
This includes Similac QINTI and Eleva which we launched into the premium infant formula market segment in China in 2014.
International adult nutrition sales increased nearly 11% in the quarter driven by strong double-digit growth in Latin America.
This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in our international adult nutrition business.
We continued to expand the adult nutrition category internationally and recently launched our Ensure brand in China into the retail market segment which represents a significant growth opportunity for Abbott.
We also continued to expand our local presence in key markets.
As Miles mentioned in addition to the three manufacturing plants we opened last year in China India and the US we announced in March the opening of a new nutrition pilot plant in Singapore.
The state of the art facility will serve as a second global R&amp;D hub.
In the US pediatric nutrition sales were up 4.5% driven by market share gains in the non-WIC segment of the infant formula market and double-digit Pedialyte growth as a result of the strong flu season.
Adults nutrition sales in the US were impacted by competitive and market dynamics including softness in the institutional segment.
We expect a modest improvement in the US adult nutrition sales growth over the course of the year as we launch new products.
For the second quarter we are forecasting mid to high single digit growth on an operational basis in our global nutritional business driven by a continued double-digit operational sales growth in international nutrition.
In our diagnostics business sales increased 6% in the first quarter with double-digit sales growth in emerging markets.
Core laboratory diagnostic sales increased 4.7% in the quarter.
This above market growth was driven by strong growth in our core laboratory segment as this business continues to increase its win rate and gain share with its customer focused solutions.
The US growth was impacted by a comparison to a strong first quarter of last year when sales increased double digits driven by higher blood screening sales.
Last week we announced a partnership agreement with the number one coagulation company in Japan to provide coagulation testing solutions to core laboratories worldwide.
This partnership broadens our diagnostics offering to meet our customers’ needs and to deliver high quality results in an efficient workflow as part of Abbott’s total solutions.
Coagulation testing is approximately a $2 billion market segment of the in vitro diagnostics market that is growing in the mid-single digits.
In molecular diagnostics sales increased 7.4% in the quarter driven by growth of our core business segment infectious disease testing.
Growth was also favorably impacted this quarter by the timing of tenders in emerging markets.
In Europe we are early into the launch of our IRIDICA infectious disease testing platform which helps identify serious infections such as sepsis.
For the second quarter we expect relatively flat growth in our molecular diagnostics business as we project growth of the infectious disease business to be offset by the declines in our non-core oncology and genetics businesses.
In point of care diagnostics worldwide sales increased 15.5% with double-digit growth in both the US and internationally as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets.
Strong growth in the quarter was driven by continued performance in the large hospital segment as well as continued adoption in the physician office laboratory and ambulatory setting where small portable solutions such as Abbott i-STAT help improve efficiencies.
For the second quarter we expect our global diagnostics business to generate mid-single digit operational sales growth.
In medical devices sales in our vascular business increased 2% in the quarter.
Sales of our MitraClip product for the treatment of mitral regurgitation increased strong double digits in the quarter both in the US and internationally.
Last month we presented data that reinforces MitraClip’s ability to reduce mitral regurgitation and improve a person’s overall health and that supports further adoption of this device.
Our endovascular business continues to have momentum with sales growing high single digits in the quarter driven by strong growth in our base business including vessel closure as well as our peripheral stent Supera.
And in our drug eluting portfolio in the US we have gained sequential market share following the XIENCE Alpine launch.
XIENCE alpine is the only drug eluting stent with an indication to treat chronic total occlusions.
We have also recently announced the launch of XIENCE Alpine in Japan.
For the second quarter we expect sales in our global vascular business to increase low single digits on an operational basis.
In diabetes care global sales in the first quarter increased nearly 3% as this business returned to growth after lapping the impact of US reimbursement changes.
Outside of the US strong consumer and physician adoption of our revolutionary new glucose sensing technology FreeStyle Libre has exceeded our initial expectations driven by a successful direct to consumer campaign.
We continued to expand FreeStyle Libre to new geographies.
Earlier this month we announced the launch in India of FreeStyle Libre Pro for professional use.
Libre Pro uses the same sensor based technology as our consumer focused FreeStyle Libre product and helps doctors obtain the comprehensive data they need to make treatment decisions.
India is a logical target market for Libre Pro because there was a large diabetes population but self monitoring of blood glucose is not a common practice.
In the US we have and will continue to segment our products and our commercial strategies to drive profitable growth.
And last week we announced the launch of FreeStyle Precision Neo a new compact easy to use blood glucose meter that allows people with diabetes to easily access a well-known multinational brand in the over-the-counter market segment.
For the second quarter we are forecasting low to mid-single digit operational sales growth in our diabetes care business.
In medical optics sales were down 3.4% in the quarter.
While this performance was below our expectations we expect to improve sales growth in our medical optics business over the rest of the year as we launch new products.
Earlier this year in the US we launched TECNIS Multifocal Low Add which provides more range of vision options to patients and surgeons.
And just last week-end at the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Meeting we launched our TECNIS Preloaded in the US which improves the ease of use for the cataract surgeon and enhances predictability of the procedure.
For the second quarter we expect our global medical optics business to grow mid single digits on an operational basis.
And lastly our established pharmaceuticals business or EPD where sales increased strong double digits in the quarter including the impact from recent acquisitions of CFR pharmaceuticals and Veropharm.
In February we completed the sale of our developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business to Mylan.
With this business now focused entirely on emerging markets we saw low double-digit underlying sales growth in our key emerging markets which include India Russia China Brazil and Colombia along with several additional markets.
Performance across the Latin American region was strong during the quarter as we are starting to see the benefits of a more complete product portfolio and sales infrastructure due to the integration of CFR.
Additionally Influvac sales were strong and benefited from the production capacity expansion we completed last year.
For the second quarter we expect similar strong double-digit growth in EPD on an operational basis including the impact of the acquisitions I mentioned.
In summary our first-quarter earnings per share and operational sales growth exceeded expectations.
We launched several new key products across our portfolio of businesses and our outlook for the year remains unchanged as we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth.
We will now open the call for questions.
Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
Hi congratulations on a good quarter and thanks for taking the question.
I was wondering if you could just like comment from a big picture perspective you have now really have done a great job of re-shifting the portfolio with disposition of the developed established pharmaceutical business and bringing in CFR and Veropharm just how are you thinking about just kind of shaping Abbott going forward.
It doesn’t necessarily seem that you need to be in a rush to certainly deploy any of the cash and you have plenty of flexibility but just how are you thinking about just kind of more from big picture strategic perspective kind of what is next? Thanks for the question Kristen.
I would say we want to grow and we want to get bigger.
And I think there is obviously two dimensions there.
One is organic and organic can be expansion of products or expansion of geography and then there is I think our footprint could benefit from being a lot bigger in a number of our businesses or even as a corporation in the diverse mix of businesses we have.
So that would imply some M&amp;A activity et cetera and nobody would be surprised to hear that out of me I don’t think.
So I think both dimensions are important to us and we are putting a fair amount of attention on both.
The notion is I think we have got the right core.
It is a very solid core of businesses that are performing well or they are in markets that we know will continue to be healthy and drive good growth and have great opportunity for us.
I think we have got the core of the company well positioned today for the attractiveness of both product markets and geographic markets that we think there is a lot of opportunity for investors for.
But beyond that I think we can do more and I think we can do a lot more and particularly if we’re bigger in a number of these spaces.
So my intention is to get bigger.
I think strategically that is how I’m thinking about it.
And to your comments about resources and timing and so forth as I have said in the past they don’t feel particularly capital constrained or resource constrained and yet I don’t feel like they have to rush out urgently either.
I think we can afford to be thoughtful and prudent but at the same time that doesn’t mean sit on our hands.
So I think the deal market or the M&amp;A market out there – I would love to say we all go out there with a plan we have the following priorities we have the following targets et cetera.
Those plans are always dead on arrival the market tells you either who is willing to talk to you who is willing to engage what valuations maybe what the circumstances in any given geography or industry may be those things always tend to determine the timing of opportunity and I think what we have been good at is being ready even opportunity aligns and when peoples’ willingness to engage aligns and so forth.
And I can’t always predict the timing of that.
But I can tell you if you are not ready when the things line up then you are not able to take advantage of it.
So we are obviously I think always tracking always studying and we have always got an idea of what our priorities would be.
The market will tell us what order we get to address and to some degree but you are right.
We are sitting in a very very good position I think right now in terms of our readiness our ability to have resources et cetera to invest the condition of our underlying business.
We have given a fair amount of attention to our cost structure to our supply chain structure to our back office structure our G&amp;A all those sorts of things over the last couple of years really to ready ourselves for bigger business and greater expansion particularly geographically and I would say that has all fallen very nicely into place.
You can see it in the results you can see it in the gross margin you can see it in the G&amp;A line you can see it in the efficiency of the business you can see it in the growth rates of some of the businesses and so forth.
I think I feel pretty good about the foundation and that is the kind of foundation you want to add to.
You don’t want to add to a weak one with a lot of problems or a lot of things you are trying to fix and you want to add to a strong one.
So I think we are in a really good position right now.
We feel good about it.
</strong>is that how we should think about M&amp;A priorities going forward in terms of things that could really leverage kind of the Abbott brand and stay within that structure? Well I wouldn’t say – I wouldn’t say to an extreme degree.
I think the word I have used a lot in the past is balance.
I think historically particularly in developed markets a lot of our businesses were reliant on government reimbursement or single payer systems and so forth and we wanted a different balance of that where there was consumer choice consumer preference consumer pay et cetera.
The very nature of the mix of our business is now is much more like that not just because of the businesses but because of geographies and the structures in those markets.
So I would say we have and for example in our pharmaceutical business branded generic pharmaceutical business overseas those are very much consumer pay markets.
The economic structure of those markets is a little different.
They are more attractive to us.
We have targeted those countries with that structure in particular as opportunity.
So I would say to the degree that opportunity exists for us yeah it is very attractive.
But I would not rule out Europe the US or traditional markets as opportunities for us for some of our businesses.
I just want a different or a more balanced structure so we are not over-reliant on heavy concentration in given geographies where there is an awful lot of decision control at a central point.
And then a lot of European countries are like that.
It is one of the reasons Europe hasn’t been as high a priority for us as emerging markets but I wouldn’t run all the way to one side of the boat either.
Perfect.
And then just a quick follow up for Tom.
Tom would you be willing to provide just the organic growth in the quarter for Abbott overall and then just --? And the top line is the mid single digits adjusted for the acquisitions.
Perfect okay thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Thanks.
Just to clean that up to Tom.
Anything more precise than mid-single digits on the organic growth? Right around 5 Mike.
And then the - it was a [bead] [ph] on the quarter but then not raising the EPS guidance is that just the timing of FX impacting the P&amp;L over the course of the year? I’d say a lit bit of it is that certainly in that exchange gain loss line I talked about that should be considered to be a little extra in this quarter offset by some negatives over the last three quarters in the currency area.
I’d say we’re although - it was a really good high quality quarter when we look at how the business has progressed both on the top line and particularly in the gross margin area and we’re just pleased with that progress at this early point of the year and I think it sets us up nicely to continue to build on that as we progress through 2015.
Mike I would add to that the analysts and investors who cover us have all paid a lot more attention in last couple of years to currency than have had to in years past and probably because multinationals have expanded so much in a lot more countries; I mean we all used to be so euro focused and yen focused and lot of companies still are but because so much of the growth for many of us is Asia Latin America other emerging markets we pay a lot more attention to a lot more currencies and I think that’s made it harder to forecast and predict particularly the mix and the shifts and so forth although when it all goes in one direction like it did the last couple of quarters that’s pretty easy.
But for us at least in terms of the currency piece I think all of us were caught off guard somewhat by the magnitude of the currency shift in the fourth quarter of last year although maybe we shouldn’t have been but we were.
And in our case as I pointed out in the past we’re less vulnerable to the euro very much less vulnerable to the euro than a lot of companies might be just because of the mix of our business and where we produce and offset the exchange but then that means we got a bigger basket of currencies to look at look at those currencies and I say okay well the ruble improved on us in the first quarter thank God and quite substantially while the Brazilian real did not and went the other way.
China is very stable India is pretty stable for us right now.
So the big currencies that you would normally think would affect us or could affect us and knock on wood and I look at I think okay this should all be pretty stable for the year barring events I can’t predict in the external world.
With regard to guidance which you asked about and I’m circling back to I just think it’s early in the year to do any change in the guidance I’m kind of a Murphy’s Law believer that the minute we make any kind of confident move something is going to go wrong with currency or something I don’t know.
I just think it’s a little early in the first quarter; I’ve to say to echo Tom the underlying performance of the company is real good and to the extent that this momentum continues and there is no change to earnings assumption - or to currency assumptions and so forth you’re going to be pressuring us on this point again in the quarter here.
And that’s all good but I think I just like to see more cards played before we move in that direction.
I look back over our last 7 or 8 years to see how many times we had adjusted guidance in the first quarter and I think we just gave it to you a couple of months ago so to change it two months later does that make sense.
I think when we change guidance a couple of times in the first quarter in the last 8 years and I’m not even sure why I did it then because I think in general I had to see half the year played before I’ve got a good feel for how things are going to lay out because generally the second half of the year is different than the first half of the year for all of us and it’s usually around the currency or some catastrophic event and world events and I would just like to see another quarter played and then if we’re cranking along like we seem to be then you’re going to be pressuring us and I’m going to be nodding and say you told me so you were right.
Okay.
So let me switch to strategy so Miles depending on what plays out with Mylan I could see you guys in the year with maybe $12 billion and $13 billion of cash probably it’s for nickel that would be outside of the U.S.
you would have still call it $5 billion of net debt potentially net cash -- made that point.
Does the cash position and the fact that really all of it being outside of the U.S.
is that really drive you to an acquisition of U.S.
assets or U.S.
domiciled assets and do you think you can put given the opportunities that you think you can put that cash in your balance sheet to work? Let me go in reverse order do I think I can put the cash in the balance sheet to work? Yes.
The timing of when I can put at the work is kind of the question which I sort of addressed to Kristen a little bit ago.
I can’t predict timing very well Mike I can predict in ten and my intent is that I’ll put it at the work.
I think we’ve always found the good balance here we are pretty stable reliable predictable in terms of dividend and payout and so forth and we have been pretty solid about balance of share buyback and capital deployment but we have also been pretty good about deploying the higher return investments and so forth and I think our deal records speak for itself.
So I would say yes the intent there the timing is little harder to predict but I’m not [indiscernible].
Now having addressed that GMI am I stuck with only opportunities overseas because of the structure of tax system in the world.
No I don’t think so I’m not ruling out the U.S.
I am not ruling on that at all and I think let’s just say we’ve got great tax guides and great management of our cash flows and access to cash if we’ve through and I think we’ve got good borrowing capacity if we want to so forth.
I think I’ve got enough flexibility that I don't have to stay in an external world.
I think there is a lot of reasons that overseas – say economically more attractive.
We all know what those are but I think those are all sort of financial packs cash related at the same time I think there is opportunities that are attractive to us strategically for our business that aren't overseas and I don't think I can rule those out.
So I don't feel constrained to being overseas.
I don't feel like our ability to finance what we may be interested in its constrained that way so while I am always looking in other geographies of the world for opportunities to expand our footprint I would tell you I have not failed to fish in my own dock here in the U.S.
and look at opportunities in the U.S.
And Miles last question and I’ll jump in it’s been relatively quiet over the last six months since the treasury action on U.S.
corporate and voting to outside the U.S.
is that something Abbott might still consider? I am not looking at it.
Let me put it that way.
The – I may not evenly think that Washington will come to its senses eventually here and make adjustments to the tax code to mix U.S.
based multinationals more competitive globally with all the companies that we compete with.
I mean there is a lot of script written about this and my position on its been clear.
This tax code disadvantage U.S.
companies and put the sale sign on them for European and other companies to buy us and arbitrage tax rates and I strenuously object to the philosophy of the U.S.
government on that line because I think in no way enhances job global creation or business creation or economic recovery in the United States when you advantage everybody else to buy our companies.
So I hope at some point that both parties in Washington will address that and I think so.
Again one of the log I think the minute we did something in around in version or otherwise that Congress surely would change the tax code and I wonder why bothered so I am not – and I am not even sure I am not tax technician to tell you whether there is a path to do that anymore.
I think right now the way things have been structured in a way the treasury addressed it and affecting the trend for some companies looking in version I think it’s clearly advantage that different M&amp;A environment for non-U.S.
companies for the U.S.
companies I think that's absolutely clear and you would have to be blind not to see it.
So I don't – it’s not on my radar screen Mike.
I am looking at things more strategically and more traditionally meaning I look at the strategic fits of the business or what we can do with it and what we can expand it and so forth and I look at whether those economics working I am not trying to subsidize our M&amp;A analysis with tax arbitrage.
Now I think lot of other companies [ex-U.S.] are definitely subsidizing their analysis with tax arbitrage because they can but we are not and that said I don't – I am not seeing the expectations of tax inversion premium in value.
I think values are high.
I kind of always think they are high.
I think they are high around the world for a lot of reasons a lot of deals are getting done at expensive prices and expensive multiples they are not because of inversion or tax they are just expensive and that's driven expectations in a lot of places up but I always think it’s expensive out there and my job is to make the best deal I can for the company but it’s pretty hard to get a real deal in some cases unless you have got a plan for what you are going to do with the business and how it’s going to operate in your hand.
So I guess to summarize all that there is – the short answer is I am not focused on inversion for the benefit of tax.
Doing those things is temporarily pre-disruptive to a company and if there is a long term belief that you need to do that and some companies have done then it must fit them strategically.
In our case I don't know that we need to do that and I would rather hope here that our government will fix the tax code in the next couple of years and if they do I think it’s going to dramatically enhance the competitiveness of companies like us.
It’s commercial for me but that's kind of the deal.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
Thank you.
Good morning Miles Tom and Tim.
I wanted to just start with the business actually and specifically around medical devices where actually I think the overall growth rate of that business looks to be trending a little bit better than where it has.
So I was hoping if you could just go into little bit more depth on the turn in the vascular business and then also what gives you confidence specifically on the medical uptick side that will see a churn in that franchise through the balance of 2015? Okay.
Let me start with the vascular side.
I think what we have seen occur here over the last few years in the core strength business in particular because everything kind of revolves around the strength business is a certain amount of stability out in the marketplace there is always price pressure.
There still is.
The major competitors in the market are pretty competitive and physicians that use our product they use all of us.
And they kind of balance it.
So I think what you have seen is the value of incremental innovation has diminished and the market has kind of stabilized one might even suggest that’s commoditizing to a degree but it’s kind of stabilizing so I would say there is kind of drum beat to price pressure as governments are payers or hospitals or whatever the case maybe are trying to manage their own budgets and in some ways I think it just forces [indiscernible] a lot more innovative about where our next frontiers are etcetera.
And I think that in the medical device business there is a lot of opportunities for innovation and rather than look at much broader footprint of very matured products we are putting our focus on a lot of innovation at eventual levels and a smaller level where there is a lot of opportunities for growth expansion and continued improvement to health care.
I am not prepared to talk a lot about that today but I would tell you that's where I am headed with that to grow and expand that device business perhaps a little differently then what people might expect.
But I like the core of what we have.
I think we are going to have to manage it a little differently going forward but I think the expansion for a lot of other related areas is there.
On medical optics it’s kind of two stories here am I pleased with our performance sometimes.
We had three or four very strong quarters in a row and then the business kind of hit a wall there is several explanations for that part of its us part of it is our own competitiveness or responsiveness part of its one of our main competitors kind of waking up again and responding to the share that we had taken in the cataract business.
I would sort of attribute that to just the ebb and flow of competition and which is good.
There is also some structural things going on there in the optics business.
We are seeing some customer consolidation in the Lasik market.
We are seeing lower utilization in the Lasik market.
We have been seeing that for a number of years now.
Cataract business for me is strong.
We have got a great drumbeat here of innovation coming steadily our R&amp;D groups have done a fabulous job I think over the last several years and they continue to just constant product innovation and launch.
So I think there are some tactical things we got to do a lot better.
I like this business it’s one I want to expand in if you got these you got to adjust internally it makes it little harder to expand you like to add to a strong and well operating core.
So we know we’ve got some improvement to do in our performance and I would say optics means on my radar screen is one to expand because there is lot of opportunity there.
Okay that’s helpful.
And then maybe switching gears on the nutrition side I think in your prepared remark you said that you had entered the Chinese market in adult nutrition with ensure in retail stores there I know that’s an opportunity that sort of in its infancy right now but would you sort of agree with an assessment there overtime that Chinese adult opportunity can be low kind billion dollar -- $2 billion or $3 billion opportunity sort of using the Vietnam template as an example I’m just looking at kind of a demographic opportunity in China and how long would it take you to realize something like that? I’m breathless to your expectations look I would tell you I’ve an ambition to put a big business.
I’m not sure I’ll put it two or three in front of the billion here and I would like to get to few hundred million and kind of get some critical math and momentum.
I do have an ambition for it to be a very substantial business kind of along the line directionally headed.
I’m just cautious about getting ahead of myself here on that I’ve got a couple of businesses here at Abbott but I’ve had those same ambitions for 10 years and there is still around half a billion dollar.
So I don’t want to perpetually be a visionary because it never comes true.
I would like for it actually to happen and so in this case I would say I believe that opportunity is there I believe that potential is there.
We got to establish the category we got to establish the use we got to establish the brand and I think what we’ve seen in the past is that every country we’ve done that in it’s been pretty substantial we create the category we’re the category we got to do that in China there is an adult category in China.
It’s a little different than what ensure or does but there has been some regulatory change there that’s been favorable to us and log us to establish this category at a more rapid pace.
And I think it’s attractive and I think there is a big upside here.
So you and I would at least be conceptually online I’m just afraid to put that specificity around size because I don’t know how long it might take.
And you could be right and wherever we’re when you’re right I want you send me a note to let me know you were right because I’ll be very happy if we are.
But I think there is a lot of opportunity to get big like that.
Okay.
I guess if you feel better we never put a timeline on it so I was more of a peak opportunity – I think you’re going to be right as I said we get to a few hundred millions first we will start and have a temporary celebration and keep moving on I mean this is kind of like having a kid and literally and you want him to be a cheater.
Let’s just take one step at a time here.
I look forward to that celebration.
And maybe just lastly on the P&amp;L looking at your kind of guidance for the year on operating margin you’ve obviously done a tremendous job of expanding profitability over the past of couple of years.
But still as I kind of look at where your margins are versus your peers it looks like there is still some room to go even after where you end up this year.
Are we still sort of in a period where you think Abbott is under earning versus the peer group insurance segment with room to go on the profitability side? I don’t like that characterization so much I mean when I look at the study annual progress of really a complex multitude of initiatives nearly from top to bottom line across all these businesses I think it’s just exactly the way to go about it and – but to answer your question directly I definitely see more margin expansion opportunity across a number of these businesses and that’s part of our expectation as we move forward.
And I think you’re already seeing it in the first quarter here and we’ve objectives in 2015 for that 100 basis points plus and there is no reason to stop there.
I think each of these businesses in moving forward and it’s a huge priority for the management team here as we look at the business.
Let me add to that a couple of things that underlying one is there is some cost side to get there – there is a lot of load hanging fruit early on that one can get okay that got that.
There is other stuff it’s structural whether its supply chain related or plant related where the plant is cost to labor cost to inputs cost to commodities distribution all those sorts of things right.
The structural ones take longer and if I look at the nutrition businesses as an example where we’ve been added for four five years there wasn’t study drumbeat every year but what we’re seeing the benefit of now is the bigger structural investments we had to make that took two or three years to realize even four years in some cases because of plant plan occasion supply chain etcetera.
And we’re now starting to see the benefits of that.
So sometimes you got to actually change process system etcetera to get at it.
Second piece of it that affects the margins is price and we’re protecting price.
This is a little bit two steps forward one step back.
Exchange keeps you racing some of the advantage of the top line and you see exchange advantages here on the bottom line to the extent that you can put pass in right places and that’s true.
But for the last few years we’ve watched tremendous advantage gained in gross margin management cost reduction you raised by exchange and all multinationals are seeing that to some degree.
So we look at it and we say okay we just got to have pretty aggressive targets here to improve these margins steadily.
I got to treat exchange almost like a cost at this point each year or price reduction and so constantly we look at the balance of that exchange how we manage it and in effect treating it like an erosion of price because that contributes to margin so you have got multiple factors that work here and we have been very intentional about how we spread our business spread our cost space managed exchange hedged exchange all of those sorts of things to protect that because honestly it hurts to gain it through cost and give it back through price erosion or exchange over year and we have affected mix the markets we choose the products we choose and so forth the mix and profitable segments versus some profitable segments less profitable segments all that affects it.
Some of it just takes time now to give you the bottom line answer to your question is there is still opportunity yes there is.
And it’s not just little.
We keep plugging it away at pretty big chunks of opportunity here.
Okay great.
I appreciate all the detail.
Thanks guys.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Good morning.
Miles just coming back to the Mylan stake here your treatment here this stake has been more patient than I think some expected which and so far is working out to your advantage.
I wonder what your thoughts from here? Just stumping.
That's right.
Patient is perfect but I wonder what your thoughts are here and how you are balancing sort of access to capital and the potential optionality of Mylan and there seems to be this view about west community that you are spending a lot of time thinking about this stake and what you do with it.
How much time you’re spending on it is this sort of important to you and how you are balancing these different factors? I just love the voracious and patience of the investment community.
We didn't even finish this deal till February that was two months ago and I know you can say why you could have been thinking about it all ahead of time.
Yes I know but you know until it’s done it’s not done and now it’s done right.
I would also say I don't feel constrained at all by the form of our capital whether it’s in Mylan stock or cash or anything else.
The fact is it has no bearing on what we can or can't do from a strategic standpoint because if for whatever reason our capital is tied up in Mylan I would just probably borrow to or unlock it.
So I don't feel like I have got any constraint at all.
And I am happy to have been patience.
When this deal was done you’ll recall the original value put on the sale of the EPD business was 5.3 billion and as I am watching the great theater out there that is surrounding Mylan and the team I’ve respect for the value of our position has risen because investors have valued Mylan stock so you say that's lucky and I think good luck any day but I am happy that we have been patience because it’s clearly accruing value to us as an owner and investor of Mylan stock I think [indiscernible] has got to an aggressive team there he’s got aggressive plans obviously other people have aggressive interest in them and all of that has been in our favorable interest financially and it’s not inconsequential that was $5 billion value $7 billion now and that's just more optionality for me and I am happy about that so I don't feel like I have to be in a real big hurry to do anything to resolve that stemming and one of the reasons that we only sold a third of the stock is because that's all we wanted to sell.
We didn't want to sell any more than that nor would we have and I would like where our – where we are with it I think it’s been prudent to hold it its proven to be a great value gainer for us and it’s not a constraint so there is no hurry on Mylan other than we don't intend to be long term holders but that doesn't need to be hurry if I put it into the cash I can tell you right now I can't earn this much on that because I am earning leaving it in Mylan so until I need to sell it I think it’s in the nice place.
Okay very clear at this whole -- doesn't work out I guess you can always be [indiscernible] so the other question I want to go in Tom is gross margins there has been lot of commentary on margins on the call here but specifically this is the strongest gross margin quarter I think we have seen since this has been actually going back before this spin at least the four quarters before the spin so can you just specifically in this particular quarter any specific drivers of gross margin it does seem largely sustainable under the second quarter but what's really driving the strongest number we have seen in three years? It’s just business mix continuing focus on cost reduction everyone focused on expanding and really it’s across the board is in the businesses.
There is a probably a slight amount of this benefit that's coming through there as well but it really is – really operating focused.
Okay and Miles just one last quick question on and I will jump back in queue there were two businesses you called out about a year ago as areas you are going to see more intensive management focus I think one was U.S.
nutritionals and the other obviously was EPD.
Between those two it does appear that there is more sustainable growth efforts sort of coming through a fruitful on the EPD side and the U.S.
nutritional business but I wonder if you could update us in terms of that management intensive focus and where you see those two businesses today? Thank you.
Well the EPD business has been pretty transparent to all of you to watch what we done overtime I mean there was several things going on.
One we came to conclusion that we wanted to focus on emerging market not develop markets and that part clearly with strategically better fit within Mylan in a much larger business focused in those developed markets and so we did that.
Now you will note we also acquired wonderful company CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America which gave us a very strong position in Latin America and enhance the one we already had and we made a fairly significant move in Russia that got done during the core of the whole Ukraine issue which was a different hit again [Murphy’s] laws if you believe it can go along -- everything kind of aligned badly and we still got that deal done unfortunately we did it Ruble so it didn't hurt us when the Ruble collapse.
So that was really good strategically and I think that what we have got now in our EPD business which was done fairly transactionally as a complete redirection of that business refocus re-emphasis where I think the biggest opportunities from our standpoint are for what we are focused on and interested in and so that's been good.
That repositioning has been good.
It’s been very intentional.
It took us about 18 months to get it done frankly I think that was faster than we might have expected the things aligned very well for us.
And so I look at the underlying growth rates of the countries that we are focused in EPD.
They are strong.
I look at our own performance its improving could it be better sure it could.
But right now it’s double-digit and above its market rates in its countries and I think that's all good.
So I like the positioning of that and that's the core that I can add to.
On the nutrition side we have gone through quite a bit of change too.
There has been some management change in the businesses.
I like the management team.
We have in place right now a lot in terms of its capabilities it’s just getting its feet under it most of our leaders there have been in place for better part of six to nine months if there has been a change that's good.
Some of that's organic some of it’s from outside.
We have made some changes in how we are investing in the business and frankly how we are marketing all of that has been a strong improvement.
I think the pediatric business is well positioned.
We will see a fair amount of improvements in our marketing coming forward here new product launches and other things that I am pretty excited about but I think will be good for that business.
So I have actually got a pretty strong comfortable feeling about the U.S.
I think our adult nutrition business is weak or weak relative to what I would expect of it.
It’s a strong business we are large in the category as you know and I think there is some things that we are working through there.
We have got a good team there and it takes a while to see the results of the changes in marketing that we put in place and the changes in products and etcetera.
so I think we just got to be I hate to say the word for you guys a little patient to wait for the results to show but the actions that we have taken which were pretty deliberate are in place.
I can remember years ago in Chicago did once that folks are saying all the pieces are in place we are going to super bowl on that and I don’t think we were in 500 that year I think the pieces are in place.
The right management in place and I am pretty pleased with where we are with that business.
You don't see it as much from your perspective because it wasn't so transactional like divesting or acquiring from the company’s word in EPD but I think I need the nutrition business is now well positioned.
When I look at the international part of it we withered a number of events whether its recalls or other things in that business and call out one example I would say the team in China has done a wonderful job regaining loss market loss share loss position from that recall couple of years ago that business is going well.
The pediatric business I am speaking of now and the share somewhere between 8.5% - 9% whatever the way we measure it and trending well those rates are trending well are positioned in a number of other companies in other countries are improving well.
So I like the underlying fundamentals of what I am seeing out of our nutrition business and I would like to say a couple of quarters of evidence of good momentum here and I think you will see it.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Okay we will take one last question from the queue please.
Thank you.
Our final question for today is from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.
Hi thanks for taking the question.
Just two quick strategy questions one on devices and one on EPD.
First Miles it sounds like from your comments that the strategy in traditional devices is going to be a little more focused on smaller innovation based deals and I was wondering is that the right way to look at it because I assume your comments in line to be a lot bigger don't really apply to traditional non-consumer facing MedTech? Let me clarify it.
I wouldn't say exclusively and so I wouldn't want you to think you are only going to see little out of me because that's probably not accurate but I think that you can't just assemble large and mature either.
You got to have a foundation and a presence and a core but the future of any core or foundational business in devices almost always depends on innovation replacement cannibalizing yourself with future innovation etcetera.
So there is got to be a balance there.
And I think we are at a point where we got this very strong core but probably not enough of the innovation that comes from the smaller kinds of companies etcetera and you can’t do everything in our own R&amp;D in that particular business.
You can't diagnostic you can't in devices so I would say you might see both.
You might see that I can tell you intentionally you are going to see we are going to be investing in smaller opportunities that could get a lot bigger because we want to build the breadth of that business but you are right.
We may well have to pay attention to the foundational base as well.
So we wouldn’t rule that out but I don't want to give you the impression that I am just looking at couple of big add-ons or something there because I am not.
Does that make sense? It does.
It does yes and will follow up a little bit more offline because I wanted to ask one other one just about EPD because you have done a couple of deals lately I am just curious are there others out there in EPD from an M&amp;A perspective or is this an area where you have kind of found what's available acquired them I am just curious how hard it is to find assets in EPDs since it looks like that's an attractive business long term? It is not hard at all to find asset.
That part is easy and it’s not hard to find really good assets.
That part is easy and it’s not hard to find assets with good management good fit good products good geographic location.
That part actually easy and I think our people and our team and some of our contacts and stuff I think we’ve a unique advantage there geographically and internationally on that particular dimension I can think of one or other companies that historically I’ve thought.
We’re thinking about it the same way because we keep bumping into them everywhere we go when we’re out hunting fishing whatever you want to call at looking opportunities we keep burning into the same one or two companies out there doing the same thing so I know that they think a little bit like we do.
But I would tell you that part is easy well hard part is getting beyond the recognition of it and getting to something where either somebody is interested in a transaction or it’s the value that doesn’t make [indiscernible] and that’s sometimes a challenge.
A lot of the things that we would be interested in and some of the international markets are family sponsored family owned or privately owned etcetera and sometimes it’s just more it’s just more complicated.
It’s not easily transacted it takes well what I call lot of relational time getting to know each other and getting to become familiar and comfortable to get somewhere with the deal.
I would say that CFR transaction this is the fabulous company.
It was a family company even though it was public.
It had a 90 year history.
It was emotional thing for them to sell the company and the company is super high quality the management is high quality.
I couldn't be more pleased and it’s a great home if you are habit for it.
It’s a great performer that deal took a while to develop comfort and relations and so forth and that's how a lot of them are that's how lot of them are [Indiscernible] was the same way and I think it just takes time so if you ask me do I think there is opportunities out there there is a lot of opportunities but they’re not fast.
Terrific I appreciate the comments thanks so much.
Okay thank you operator and thank you everyone for all your questions.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Okay.
Thanks Scott.
Good morning.
Today we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.52 above our guidance range and reflecting another quarter of double-digit underlying growth.
Sales increased double digits operationally for the second consecutive quarter.
Excluding the impact of the 2014 acquisitions and foreign exchange sales increased 6.5% which as expected reflects an acceleration of our performance from the first quarter.
We also exceeded both our gross and operating margin targets in the quarter.
As you know macroeconomic events continue to be a major theme in 2015.
Looking back to the beginning of the year most companies including Abbott were dealing with the challenge of setting 2015 guidance in the context of the strengthening U.S.
dollar against almost every currency that occurred late in 2014.
We set our growth target high with a forecast for double-digit EPS growth excluding exchange and 9% absolute growth.
Halfway through the year foreign exchange is impacting results for Abbott at a somewhat higher level than we projected in January.
At the same time the fundamentals of the end markets in which we compete remain strong and we've remained disciplined in managing our business in this environment.
Strong performance has and will continue to help offset currency headwinds as we're well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for the year.
With that context in mind our full-year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 remains unchanged which again reflects double-digit underlying growth.
I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning the call over to Brian and Scott.
And let me start with Diagnostics where we achieved very strong sales growth of 9% in the quarter driven by continued above-market performance in Core Lab and Point of Care Diagnostics.
We continue to capture share and win new Core Laboratory accounts with our customer-focused solutions including the immunoassay business of the two largest commercial labs in China during the first half of the year.
In Point of Care Diagnostics we achieved another quarter of double-digit sales growth.
We continue to enhance our product offering and expand our presence in targeted international geographies including Europe where we recently launched our wireless i-STAT handheld device; and in the Middle East Japan and Latin America where we achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter.
In the U.S.
sales performance was driven by continued adoption of our i-STAT system in large hospitals and remote care settings.
In Nutrition sales increased 4% slightly below our expectations.
In China we achieved double-digit growth and share expansion with the new Pediatric products we launched last year.
At the same time recent market softness in Hong Kong and Vietnam impacted our overall international Pediatric growth rate in the quarter.
The international Adult Nutrition business delivered another quarter of strong sales growth including double-digit growth in Latin America as we continue to build and shape the Adult Nutrition category globally.
In Medical Devices our Diabetes Care business delivered 5% growth in the quarter somewhat ahead of expectations including international growth of 10%.
Consumer response to our new FreeStyle Libre device continues to be very positive in Europe and we're expanding capacity to meet this demand.
We also made progress during the quarter to bring the Libre sensor-based technology to the U.S.
with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro our professional use device.
Our Vascular business performed in line with expectations.
Operational sales growth in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth of our structural heart therapy MitraClip the first and only device available for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation.
In Medical Optics sales were impacted by market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses.
We expect improved sales growth over the remainder of the year driven by market uptake of several recent product launches that enhance our portfolio.
And in Established Pharmaceuticals sales increased double digits excluding the impact from recent acquisitions and foreign exchange.
Improved operational execution and portfolio expansion are driving above-market sales growth in several geographies including India China and Colombia.
We're seeing the benefit from the integration of CFR Pharmaceuticals with a broader product portfolio in key therapeutic areas and expanded sales force driving double-digit underlying sales growth in Latin America.
So in summary we achieved another quarter of double-digit sales growth including a sequential improvement in our organic growth rate as expected.
We're particularly pleased with our performance in the branded generics business and another quarter of above-market growth in Diagnostics.
We continue to make progress on margin expansion and reported second quarter earnings per share results ahead of our expectations.
And despite a challenging currency environment which you'll hear a lot of I'm sure during earnings season we're well on track to achieve our financial objectives in 2015 reflecting the strong outlook we forecasted for EPS growth at the beginning of the year.
So I'll now turn the call over to Brian and Scott to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and then be back for questions.
Brian? Finance and Chief Financial Officer</strong> Thank you Miles.
As Miles indicated today we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.52 above our previous guidance range.
Sales for the quarter increased 10.8% on an operational basis that is excluding an unfavorable impact of around 8.5% from foreign exchange.
The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to strengthening of the U.S.
dollar relative to several currencies in the latter part of the quarter.
Reported sales increased somewhat above 2% in the quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in our Diagnostics and branded generics businesses.
Sales in emerging markets increased 21% on an operational basis.
Excluding the impact of 2014 acquisitions and foreign exchange total company sales in the emerging markets increased 11%.
Given recent investor interest in the Chinese economic situation I'd note that our sales in China which represents around 8% of our overall sales increased strong double-digits in the quarter.
The second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.8% of sales slightly ahead of our previous guidance due to continued underlying improvements in Diagnostics and Nutrition and up 250 basis points over 2014.
In the quarter adjusted R&amp;D investment was around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense was around 32% of sales.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015.
As Miles indicated our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 from continuing operations remains unchanged and continues to reflect strong double-digit underlying growth.
Regarding our full-year 2015 outlook for the P&amp;L we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the high single digits.
Based on current exchange rates we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 7.5% on our full-year reported sales more than our original full-year projection in January of around 6%.
As previously indicated the increase reflects strengthening of the U.S.
dollar versus several currencies late in second quarter.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2015.
Scott will provide more detail on the 2015 outlook by businesses in a few minutes.
We now forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 58% for the full year reflecting gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses.
We continue to forecast adjusted R&amp;D investment of around 6.5% of sales and now forecast adjusted SG&amp;A expense approaching 32% of sales.
We forecast net interest expense of around $80 million reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both our borrowing rates for debt and the income we earn on some of our investments.
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2015 we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.52 to $0.54 reflecting double-digit underlying growth largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange headwinds on operating results.
We forecast operational sales growth in the low double digits in the third quarter.
At current exchange rates we'd expect a negative impact from exchange somewhat above 9% in the quarter third quarter resulting in reported sales growth in the low single digits.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 57% of sales adjusted R&amp;D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense approximately 31% of sales in the third quarter.
Finally we project specified items of $0.21 in the third quarter reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release with the exception of the gain on the sale of a portion of our Mylan shares which occurred in the second quarter.
In summary we achieved another quarter of strong performance and are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for the year despite a challenging currency environment.
With that I will turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook.
Scott? Thanks Brian.
Today I'll provide an overview of our second quarter sales performance and outlook by business.
As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I'll start with Diagnostics where sales increased 8.7% in the quarter including above market growth in both developed and emerging markets.
In Core Laboratory Diagnostics both U.S.
and international sales increased 8.5% including another quarter of double-digit growth in emerging markets led by strong performance in China and Russia.
In Molecular Diagnostics sales also increased 8.5% driven by double-digit growth in our Core Business segment of infectious disease testing.
Growth this quarter was somewhat above our expectations primarily due to slower than planned scale down of our genetics business and timing of tender orders in emerging markets.
In Point of Care Diagnostics sales increased 11.5% driven by continued adoption of our market-leading i-STAT platform.
During the quarter we continued to enhance our product offering including the U.S.
FDA approval of our Total β-hCG test which detects pregnancy in early stages during critical emergency situations.
For the third quarter we expect global diagnostic sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis.
In Nutrition worldwide sales increased 4% for both pediatric and adult nutrition.
In Pediatric Nutrition we continued to expand our product portfolio with the recent launch of the first certified organic infant formula offered by a large multinational company in China.
In the U.S.
we launched Similac Advance non-GMO the first and only non-GMO labeled formula from a leading infant formula manufacturer.
In Adult Nutrition sales growth was led by international performance.
As expected U.S.
Adult Nutrition sales were impacted by competitive and market dynamics primarily in the Institutional segment.
We now expect global Nutrition sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis for the third quarter and full-year 2015.
In Medical Devices sales in our Vascular business increased 3% led by strong double-digit growth in MitraClip our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation.
During the quarter we completed regulatory submissions for approval of Absorb in both the U.S.
and Japan and expect to submit in China in the coming months.
Collectively these markets represent more than 50% of the world's coronary stent market.
We also enhanced our Absorb product offering in Europe with the approval of Absorb GT1 a new advancement of the Absorb stent system that improves ease of use.
For the third quarter we expect global Vascular sales to increase low single digits on an operational basis.
In Diabetes Care sales increased 5% somewhat ahead of expectations led by strong international performance.
In the U.S.
we launched FreeStyle Precision Neo during the second quarter.
This easy-to-use meter provides consumers with an affordable well-known brand in the over-the-counter segment of the market.
For the third quarter we forecast low single-digit operational sales growth in our global Diabetes Care business.
In Medical Optics sales were up 1% somewhat below our expectations due to market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses.
Earlier this week we announced U.S.
FDA approval and launch of our iDesign System which creates a 3-D map of the eye that is 25 times more precise than traditional systems and offers the potential for more people to qualify for our LASIK procedure.
We now expect global Medical Optics business to grow low single digits for both the third quarter and full year 2015.
And lastly Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD where sales increased double digits in quarter with and without the impact of recent acquisitions.
EPD continues to make meaningful progress in becoming a more consumer-facing business with an increased focus on branding initiatives marketing to the pharmacy channel and building the Abbott brand in key countries.
For the third quarter we expect similar double-digit growth in EPD.
In summary we achieved another quarter of strong growth achieved several new product launches across our businesses and are well-positioned to deliver high single digit operational sales growth for the full-year 2015.
We will now open the call for questions.
Thank you.
Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Hi.
Thanks for taking the questions.
Actually I have a bunch of questions I'll try and be brief though.
So Miles...
Let's do it as one great big run-on question Mike.
Yeah.
That's usually the way it works.
Miles I think everybody would love to hear your thoughts on China.
Obviously there was some concern about how your China performance would look coming into the quarter given Mead Johnson's report comments from other multinationals about China overall so we'd love to get your comments there.
And then maybe a second item you guys disclosed that you'd filed Absorb in the U.S.
the initial PMA.
Can you disclose at this point whether ABSORB III hit its primary endpoint and anything else you can share on it? Thanks.
Okay.
Well let me comment on China first.
A lot of times you don't know how you're really doing until you see reports of your own competitors to give you context about what others are experiencing in a market.
I'd say overall we're pretty pleased with China.
We're gaining share.
The launch of our new products is moving us along quite nicely.
I think several of us have experienced this cross-border issue in Hong Kong some more than others apparently and that certainly impacted us a little bit as well but we feel pretty good about China.
I mean it's only about 10% of our total Nutrition sales and about 8% of the total company.
So if there's a hiccup in China it doesn't tend to have a big impact on Abbott as a whole.
That said it's an important market.
This is an important business there for us.
I'd say the fundamentals of our business in China are great.
We're growing double digit a strong double digit I should say.
And new product launches going fine.
We're gaining share.
I'm probably less pleased with the development pace of the adult business in China which is a new category but I'm usually dissatisfied with pace no matter what it is.
So I'd say we feel pretty good about China.
I was surprised at the pre-announcement that we saw from one of our competitors but actually gave me a little better feel that the issues cross-border from Hong Kong to Mainland China were impacting others as well so we weren't the only people seeing some of that impact.
So I guess that context helped.
On Absorb I really don't have much to report.
We have a series of improvements or incremental changes to our product over time here.
This is one of the first.
So beyond that I don't think I can comment on your question.
Maybe Brian or somebody else can but...
Finance and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong> At this point we don't have any further information to report on the details of the trial Mike.
We file and then ultimately timing will dictate whether this goes to Japan or not ultimately as we move through 2016.
I would tell you Mike as long as you asked about Absorb I was pleased to see that the Vascular business sequentially here while it's not booming double digits is still improving quarter-to-quarter.
And even though these are low single digit numbers for Vascular that's an improvement over what we've seen say the last year and a half 18 months or whatever.
So I'm pretty happy about that.
I like the direction we're headed here and frankly I like the direction we're headed with the breadth of the business the next-generation products in the business across the board and not just in the stent business but other aspects of the whole Vascular franchise.
Miles just one follow-up.
Can you just share with us your updated thoughts on M&amp;A and use of your balance sheet? Any changes since our call a month ago? Well you know I tried to be studiously evasive then and I probably will try to be that now.
So in some respects no change other than increasingly as time is passing here our focus is sharpening on where our interests lie.
And I'm pretty pleased with well the portfolio of opportunity.
But as I explained before it depends on alignment with other companies and so forth and their interests.
So I think that while I've said in the past sometimes there's not much out there that one can justify from a valuation standpoint or a fit I'd have to say today while valuations are high I think there's a fairly robust set of opportunities that fit several of our businesses quite nicely and our strategies and intentions quite nicely.
So I'm not sitting here on a pile of cash thinking there's nothing out there of interests that fits us.
Quite the contrary.
I think there's quite a lot out there that fits us well.
So I don't really want to directionally comment more than that because I generally don't like to telegraph where our interests lie for obvious reasons.
But I'd say I like what I see I particularly – I have to say you're probably dying to ask me this as a follow-on as well – I really like that Mylan investment right now as a place to park our cash while we're looking at the opportunities we're interested in.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank Inc.</span></strong> Hi.
Thanks for taking the question.
I guess with respect to that Mylan investment right now since you talked about it I guess what are the terms that you have to vote along with management or abstain from the vote just in terms of monetizing that and maximizing the value? You said that was more of a short-term investment that you didn't have intentions on being a long-term owner in Mylan.
So I guess how should we think about the still being a holder in Mylan stock or someone else's stock? Well I'd say that nothing's changed.
I mean we don't have an intention long term of being shareholders in Mylan.
On the other hand I suppose you could say well what's long term? And until we actually have to monetize that investment I'd put it this way.
Cash on most people's balance sheets today earns pretty close to zero.
And that said I think this is a pretty good place to have our cash parked because I think that Mylan as a company is pursuing a strategy that I would endorse.
I have a little bit of insight given our continued dealings with our partners at Mylan.
And I like the strategy that Mylan's pursuing and I support it and endorse it as a shareholder.
So from that perspective I think that this is right now as long as we are a shareholder we're going to vote in our interest and Mylan's interest because as shareholders it certainly directly impacts Abbott.
And I think what they're pursuing with their Perrigo acquisition is something we clearly endorse.
We've said so.
We have the right to vote our shares on that particular issue as we like.
And that's an independent decision by us.
It's not one that the Mylan board or management controls.
That's our decision.
And we made that clear several weeks ago that we support what they're doing there.
Obviously Teva has other desires for Mylan but my own assessment of that is a shareholder of Mylan is that's not likely to happen.
And I think as Mylan's shareholders or Teva's or others' review in more detail the Mylan situation in the Netherlands in particular and the rules around foreign acquisitions whether in the Netherlands or in Ireland or other places I think that their investors are gradually figuring out what the degrees of freedom are that anybody particularly has.
And in our case we know that pretty well as the largest shareholder of Mylan we know it pretty well.
So I'd say we put our interest where our best interests lie and that's to support Mylan's current strategy and current pursuit of Perrigo.
And we get to vote that ourselves so – independently and I think it's important for not only our shareholders but the other Mylan shareholders to know that since we're the largest one and we get to make that decision.
With regard to certain votes Mylan would control the vote if they were pursued.
So if a company like Teva pursues Mylan Mylan controls the vote of those shares as long we have more than 5% of Mylan.
But frankly we're pretty aligned on that.
I mean we haven't disagreed with Mylan on this at all at any point in time.
So I think we're not just a passive ride-along here.
There's our interests here there's Mylan's interests here and we're voting our interests and our own shareholders' interest and I think it's a good place for the proceeds from that transaction to be for now.
And as I said we don't intend to be long term but in the interim here while we don't need access to those resources we certainly want those resources invested the best possible way for us and our investors.
And I like what I see there and I endorse what they're doing.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then just on the strength of the results that we've seen for the first half I guess why not tighten the range from a guidance perspective for the second half of the year? For the full year? You know we could have.
I suppose we could have tightened the range.
The – I think there's enough volatility in the currency markets that I'd say it would – my concern was it would imply a degree of forecast-ability and precision that I'm not sure anybody really has.
And there's a pretty strong possibility that we will beat this original guidance.
But I'm a superstitious guy and I think the minute we try to be more precise than where we already are Murphy is going to reach up and strike us.
And I think that there's always some unpredictable event that happens.
I can't predict what those events are.
We're having another strong year in spite of a very strong headwind of exchange.
I think the impact on us from currency this quarter is probably as great as anything I've seen.
It's everything that everybody wrung their hands about back in December and January as companies struggled to give guidance and we wrung our hands too.
But the fact is we set a double digit target every year and a real double digit target and we did again this year.
And so we set a high bar at the beginning of the year and we're exceeding that high bar thus far.
But I have to say that given the volatility of certain geographies of the world and/or currencies I thought I'd just go one more quarter.
And by the time we actually change this guidance you're going to say we told you so and you'll already know that we're likely to exceed for the year.
I probably could have tweaked the lower end which would have said gee I'm confident.
You know I am confident.
I wouldn't forecast to you anything that I know of today as a downside to this business other than what we all see as ongoing currency translation.
You watch CNBC or other things and people say do you only invest in American stocks and don't invest in companies overseas? All you got to do is look at our underlying growth rates and you can see that investing where we are in emerging markets and other places is paying off.
And it's very strong growth for us.
It's very profitable growth for us.
And I've said before if you want to be where the growth is you got to be able to navigate the volatility and that's what we're doing.
We're navigating the volatility.
We're delivering steady reliable double digit earnings net of exchange in spite of how strong the exchange is.
And I think that's what we're supposed to do.
And I have to say wouldn't have expected it to be tested quite so severely by this kind of currency challenge but we're meeting and beating that.
And given that we set a high bar early I guess my judgment was I'm not ready to move that exchange yet or the guidance yet because I think it is pretty unusual that the currency is as volatile as it is.
So that's one great way of wringing my hands in front of you and saying you're probably right but you get to be right at the end of the third quarter.
Inc.</span></strong> No problem.
Thanks.
Good quarter.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
Thank you and good morning everybody.
I wanted just to follow up on the capital deployment side and ask one financial question.
Miles maybe you could just talk a little bit about your use of cash strategy more broadly.
I mean if I look over the past call it four quarters to eight quarters you've had a big increase in the dividend that occurred in late 2013.
You've been buying back stock fairly consistently and you've now announced some M&amp;A but nothing significant.
Can you maybe just sort of help us understand your broader capital allocation strategy and how we should think about the mix of use of cash? Well yeah and I think it's been pretty clear.
I mean it's a great problem to have.
Gee we have a lot of cash and a lot of cash flow and I think (31:49) the businesses are strong and they generate great cash flow.
We're able to fund our plant and equipment needs.
We've built a number of plants around the world in the last couple of years.
We're expanding capacity.
We're doing all the things you'd do to support the ongoing growth of the business from an internal standpoint and yet we generate a lot of cash.
And in some regards you'd say there's a lot of different things you could do with that cash.
We know that part of the identity of the company is a dividend and so we are attentive to an appropriate dividend payout in a range of a percentage of EPS somewhere between 40% or 45% of EPS.
And we tend to maintain that steady range because there's a lot of investors out there who rely on us for steady passive income that way in their portfolio.
So that's one use of cash and frankly we don't have any difficulty funding that.
So I think that's an important aspect of the identity that's Abbott.
M&amp;A activity is opportunistic to a degree as you know and it can be funded by your cash flow or it can be funded by debt as well.
We watch our debt ratio carefully.
We watch our debt rating.
We watch all those things.
But I have a say right now while we've got what I think is a fairly attractive menu of opportunities for us from an M&amp;A standpoint you just haven't seen us act on it.
Now I would also tell you over the last 10 years you've seen us act on a lot of things and we don't tend to forecast it until it's already happened.
And so I'd say you probably should not assume that we're just sitting on our hands accumulating.
I think investors expect us to deploy cash and we do and we will.
I mean that's one of the things – I'd have to say leaving our cash in Mylan right now is good place for it to be if we haven't got something else to do with it.
I'm not a big fan of borrowing to buy back shares.
I think that's artificial and short term.
Although I know there are many activists who might advocate such I think we can deploy our capital to earn a healthy return but it doesn't mean you can do it on a rolling quarterly basis.
It depends on when the M&amp;A activity is available or when the opportunity arises.
So we're all about building and growing the company and investing the capital in things that earn at an attractive rate for our investors.
And if we have capital beyond that which we always seem to do we do buy back shares.
I think we should – we do have a philosophy of returning cash to our investors at least at some level to keep our stock and share count from being diluted et cetera.
I chuckle a little bit because some investors or analysts out there condemn the practice of buying back shares while other investors want you to return cash to them or capital to them as part of the return and it's interesting to listen to these two diametrically opposed points of view.
It's almost like everybody wants to be chronically unhappy.
I think it's a great problem to have great cash flow and a lot of cash.
We can fund the dividend.
We can fund the share buyback.
The question is how big in any given point in time.
And frankly we're able to fund a fair amount of M&amp;A.
And M&amp;A that is strategically a good fit with the company and a good return above and beyond certainly what we can earn with cash but what we can earn in a lot of things.
So we tend to look at it in all those ways.
Right now I'd say it's in our interest to obviously support our dividend maintain a certain level of share buyback which we do each year on a steady basis and husband our resources for what we believe are some great opportunities in M&amp;A.
We try to keep that balance in the right balance.
We do pay attention to the returns we're earning for our shareholders.
And frankly we track what our shareholders think about that capital deployment or redeployment so that frankly we're reflecting what they're looking for as an investment.
So I don't know if that specifically answered your question but I'd say right now the level of share buyback that we've typically done is not threatened in any way.
I would not go out and do some big leveraged share buyback.
Frankly if I was going to go seek leverage it would be to acquire additions to the company which I think would make a lot of sense.
Okay.
Yes.
That is very helpful actually.
And then on the financial side if I look at your guidance for the full year it looks like your targeting about a 19.5% operating margin.
But as I kind of look at the comp set of the individual businesses in which you compete that would suggest that there are several hundred basis points still of margin expansion left in the business.
I guess A would you agree with that assessment? And B if so is there a reasonable case to be made for consistent call it 100 basis points or so a year of operating margin expansion? Yeah I think in the foreseeable future I'd say that's the case.
It's an interesting thing we've done very well in the margin expansion particularly in Nutrition and Diagnostics.
And in fact in Diagnostics I think there's more opportunity.
But I wouldn't drop all of it through to the bottom line.
I'd like to be investing even more in R&amp;D and Diagnostics and some in SG&amp;A.
I think all of our businesses would take more sales and marketing investments in a heartbeat.
Every business always thinks it's tight and it always thinks it has more things to spend money on.
But the reason they call it discretionary spending is because it's discretionary.
And I think to the extent that we keep improving the margins part of that is good for the shareholder and part of it is good for discretionary spending depending on the worth of the investment whether it's R&amp;D or sales and marketing expansion.
So I agree with you.
I think there's more opportunity.
I think the Nutrition business has shown a tremendous capabilities to improve its gross margins.
Now to be fair we've had the benefit of low commodity prices and at some point that's going to end and we'll see it change.
But we have the benefit of low commodity prices.
That's clearly reflected in our margins in the Nutrition business.
I think the Diagnostics business has just made great strides in what it's done from a gross margin standpoint.
There are days when I look at the margins in these business and say but for exchange or but for price pressure in given markets there's not a lot of robust price upside out there in a lot of these businesses and yet even in the face of exchange and/or pricing depending on where you are in the world the margins keep improving which I think is a great credit to the management team in these businesses.
So long way around I agree with you.
I think there's still consistent opportunity to keep improving margins.
And like every other CEO of a multinational I'm waiting for the day that the U.S.
dollar weakens.
Okay.
Got it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Good morning.
Miles just one question one quick follow-up on some prior questions.
Just coming back to China you have less exposure to many of the factors that your competitor obviously described for their China weakness and you're actually seeing strength in China.
But Nutritional growth did come down modestly for the remainder of the year.
So where specifically is that pressure coming from if it's not a lot of China? Well we've got some challenges in Vietnam and some other places as well.
The market in Vietnam has slowed I'd say kind of suddenly and a lot.
And I don't think we're losing any share in Vietnam but we've certainly seen it slow.
And from time to time we see the impact of government price pressures and so forth.
But do I expect that to be a sustained situation in Vietnam? No I don't.
I can't always explain why any given market will suddenly take a breather but they seem to.
And in this particular case Vietnam and Hong Kong both are impacting these numbers to a degree.
Last year Saudi Arabia impacted our numbers to a degree.
And in a lot of cases I think we get so used to watching China that we discount the impact that other countries may have on our performance.
And the truth is we're pretty large in Vietnam.
We're the biggest nutrition company in Vietnam by far it's a big market for us.
Same with Saudi Arabia.
There are some of these markets that because China gets so much attention we tend to think are rounding error and they're not rounding error they're important.
And they're big markets for us.
So when we see some impact in the marketplaces in some of these other countries it does affect the collective numbers overall.
Because as I mentioned earlier China's only about 8% of the whole company and that's all businesses including Pharma and Devices Diagnostics et cetera.
Our second biggest business in China is Diagnostics.
And so China's important to the company across the board but it's only 8% of all our sales and in the Nutrition business it's only 10%.
Our competitors sometimes are much more highly indexed in China relative to other countries.
And I say that and the Danones and the Meads and the Nestlés they're in all the same countries we are but the degree to which they are dependent on China versus other countries varies.
And in our case while China's a very big business in Nutrition relative to the total of all the business in Nutrition and in Abbott it's not as big.
So some of these – the long story short some of these lesser smaller markets or countries also impact the look of sales.
So what you're seeing here I think is more Vietnam and Hong Kong than fundamental Mainland China.
Okay.
Very helpful.
And then Miles you talked to extensively today about (41:48) the Mylan-Perrigo situation.
Just a small nuance was there a benefit to Abbott shareholders in expressing earlier support for Mylan-Perrigo than perhaps you needed to or are people just making too much at that particular point? Well I think a lot of people are making a little too much of it.
But I think that first of all the rules in the Netherlands are a lot more complex than what a lot of investors understood and certainly about Mylan's domicile there.
And therefore what – there's been a fair amount of press more lately around the so-called structure of ownership in the Netherlands the Stichting and all these other things.
And I think if one assesses the clear path to completion of Mylan's interest in Perrigo versus Teva's interest in Mylan there's a pretty clear difference.
And I don't think investors completely appreciate that because I don't think they know the underlying hurdles or rules et cetera.
And so I think that I think a lot of investors could have misunderstood or misperceived a choice that doesn't actually exist my view one investor.
And so I wanted to make it clear where the largest investor in Mylan stood because I think that will influence other investors to take a closer look at the facts of what is the clear path to completion here in terms of the – what are thought to be alternatives that I don't think are.
And to the extent that that influence other investors to take a closer look I think that's in Abbott's best interest as Mylan's largest shareholder rather than continuing to debate back-and-forth an alternative that I don't think truly is.
End of comment.
Thanks.
Very clear very important commentary.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
Hi.
Good morning guys.
Miles I'm a little surprised just here in the middle of the year we haven't seen a lot – or any M&amp;A from you.
And I'm not sure if you're paying attention to Congress but there's a chance that attached to the highway bill there may be a tax holiday toward the backend of this year.
So given the fact that a lot of your cash sits outside the United States I'm just wondering is that what's holding back any M&amp;A? Are you potentially waiting for this potential tax holiday? And if there is one would that accelerate the pace of M&amp;A? Thank you.
No.
Yeah.
The image that comes to mind is Charlie Brown holding a football for Lucy.
Do I think Congress is actually going to do anything with tax policy before the end of the year? I give you a resounding no.
So I would tell you not for one minute would I hold back our M&amp;A interest based on thinking that Congress is actually going to do something in some comprehensive and constructive fashion here about tax policy in the United States.
I hate to be that definitive about it.
You can probably tell what I think but no I – that has no impact whatsoever.
And I'd say the things that have impacted us here up to now has mostly been us completing all the things that we needed to complete which we've done.
We think we're in good shape on all our transitional things.
And it's more just our own pursuits and decision-making that is driving our M&amp;A portfolio.
I mean we've got a lot of opportunities I think to support our branded generic pharma business and we've got a lot of opportunities in the device space.
And that's where a lot of our interest is right now.
We'll make a lot of progress there.
It will become more apparent by the end of the third quarter I feel confident.
Apparent doesn't mean there's some great blockbuster coming here.
Those things tend to take time and I don't know that I can predict time right now.
But I'd say look we're – I already said – normally I've been on this call and said there's not that much out there.
Frankly there's a lot.
And – but it's all very highly valued and nothing's easy in the deal world and I think you know that even though there's a lot of activity these days in fact a lot more activity than we've seen in a long time over the last 18 months.
So I'm not sitting here holding back for anything.
I think we're moving along as best we can.
I think the one thing that holds anybody back is the fear of overpaying or paying too much and – or making a poor deal.
And I think we've always tried to be disciplined about our deals.
I always find that we're criticized for paying too much until a couple of years later when everybody says hey great buy.
We try to make intelligent deals.
I don't think you can ever expect not to pay full value for something but we're always careful about what we think we can do with a given business and whether we can add value to it and so forth.
And trying to find that sweet spot where everybody's happy is sometimes a little slower than we might like.
Okay.
And just one quick follow-up.
I'm not going to ask you about your view on the med tech tax.
So I'll just ask quickly in the past you've said that the fact that your cash sits outside the U.S.
or most of it's outside the U.S.
it would not hold you back from doing M&amp;A in the United States.
Does that still hold true? That still holds true.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi.
Good morning.
Thanks for taking the questions.
I guess my first is there's certainly been a lot of conversation of you getting bigger and I understand that but are you also contemplating further pruning of the business meaning product lines that may not fit as well or visibility and the returns may not be there? Is that part of the strategy going forward? It is not.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then just a specific question and following up on an earlier one on the Nutrition softness outside of China I think you mentioned price in Vietnam and I'm guessing Hong Kong as well.
Is this is a dynamic that you'll be facing for the next three quarters until it laps? Or are there other factors there that would allow you to turn this geography around a little earlier? No.
I don't actually expect a long sustained downturn we've got to lap here et cetera.
Brian is dying to say something.
Let me let him comment.
Finance and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong> No I just wanted to add...
Brian was just there by the way.
So he really wants to tell you about it.
Finance and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
So in Vietnam we are gaining share.
Remember we are recovering.
So all things are pointing the right way there.
This is truly a market issue.
So I think this is within our destiny to control.
The good news too I think with Nutrition is when you look even beyond that area we're growing double digits in key Latin American markets as well.
So a little bit different dynamics and circumstances than maybe what we heard from others last week.
So I feel good about where we're at.
Yeah.
It's hard to generalize because it – and we just had my staff meeting earlier this week and we look at every geography.
We look at our share position.
We look at our competitors.
And I have to tell you every one of these countries has got a different mix of competitors.
And different companies are strong in different countries.
So it's hard to just generalize with one brush across them all.
Vietnam as I said before it's been an important market for us.
It is an important market for us it will be.
I don't anticipate some long-term difficulty here.
But it clearly impacted this quarter.
Inc.</span></strong> Fair enough.
Thank you.
Operator we'll take one more question.
Thank you.
Our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
Hey guys.
Thanks for taking the question.
Can you hear me okay? Yes.
Great.
Hey let me start one product; question one strategic question.
So international diabetes growth accelerated nicely this quarter I think you had 10% operational growth outside the U.S.
Libre the feedback is all frankly phenomenal that we've heard but you're capacity constrained I believe? So – and you filed Libre Pro in the U.S.
So Miles can you just kind of give us an update on Libre? How big do you think that product can be for you in 2015 2016? When do you think you'll be – won't be supply constrained? And when are we going to see the key European and U.S.
studies that you have ongoing? And I have one follow-up after that.
Thanks.
I'll tell you we think we've got a real winner of a product here but we are capacity constrained and that's our own problem.
We obviously didn't build enough capacity for what we anticipated.
We expect that to start easing in the mid to late fall.
We'll have considerably more capacity online at that point and we continue to invest in capacity because I – we believe in the impact of this product and the response from diabetics and consumers is frankly terrific.
We intentionally slowed down our marketing because there's no point in creating greater difficulty in terms of demand for a while until we can fix that capacity issue and we're getting close to that point now where we can go back to a more aggressive marketing of the product.
But in the meantime we're just waiting for that capacity to come online.
Brian did you catch the rest of those questions? Finance and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong> Yeah it was with respect to Libre Pro with respect to the launch that we had in the U.S.
– or pending launch after the (51:52) approval submission.
The submission yeah.
Finance and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong> So yeah Larry recall we just got this approved in India.
I mean this is a great opportunity for us to go after the doctors and the patients in a different way.
We did file and submit in the U.S.
and typical timeline I'd say here is approximately a year.
But again this is probably a modest segment but it's still an important one for the professional segment that we're targeting.
But I'd say overall between this strategy as well as what we have internationally with Libre and even our approach to the market here in the U.S.
with some of our offerings is really balanced and really helping us as you see here return to growth for the Diabetes Care business.
I mean to be performing in the mid-single digits is where we expected to be and so I think everything's on track.
I don't think I could forecast for you how big it's going to be.
I don't know.
I just don't know.
What I do know is anything I'd tell you would be wrong.
So I think it'll be a significant product.
I think after say 6 months to 12 months of unfettered availability we'll know pretty well but I'd like to hit that capacity or the capacity release point where we've got plenty of manufacturing capacity and we're unconstrained and then we'll get a better sense of that.
Thanks.
And then on a strategic note when one looks at the – at Abbott's Vascular business it doesn't have the breadth right now as its two main competitors.
And cardiovascular device is one of the therapeutic areas where we have seen contracting across product categories so what are the strategic implications of those factors for Abbott's Vascular business? At some point does that business Miles need more breadth within the cardiovascular device space? Thanks for taking the questions.
Yeah and I think I – yeah I do think it needs more breadth but I also think it needs pretty solid performance in the pieces it has.
I think we can do better on the stent front than we're doing and I think we can do better in the endovascular space than we're doing.
Structural heart for us really right now is a product but we think there's a lot more breadth there that we should be participating in.
And then I think beyond that in the device space whether it's Vascular or not there's a lot more breadth.
We created a different structure in our organization where we'll incubate ventures.
Ventures can take on a lot of different sizes and there's a lot of activity there right now.
We have a clear focus on expanding and broadening the whole device business.
It's actually going really well.
We're just not in a position to tell you much about it yet and it ranges from equity investments to outright ownership or assembly of businesses there.
And we announced early in this quarter the second quarter that we were making a change there to not just be a venture funder but actually builder of business.
And it's surprising to me how much opportunity kind of exploded in that space for us.
So yeah we're going to broaden it well underway a lot of opportunities agree with your point and we're on it.
Thanks for taking the questions guys.
Thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions and that concludes Abbott's conference call.

I would now like to introduce Mr.
Scott Leinenweber Vice President Investor Relations.
Investor Relations</strong> Good morning and thank you for joining us.
With me today are Miles White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Tom Freyman Executive Vice President Finance and Administration and Brian Yoor Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian and I will discuss our performance in more detail.
Following our comments Miles Tom Brian and I will take your questions.

On today's conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Thanks Scott.
Good morning.
Today we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 at the high end of our previous guidance range.
We also narrowed our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.14 to $2.16.
The midpoint of our guidance range remains unchanged and continues to reflect double digit underlying growth.
Sales in the quarter increased double digits operationally for the fourth consecutive quarter.
And before I summarize our results I'd like to take a moment to discuss two topics that have dominated the headlines of late growth in emerging markets and the continued strengthening of the U.S.
dollar.
Healthcare growth and demand remains strong despite challenges facing emerging economies.
In the third quarter Abbott again achieved double digit organic growth in emerging markets led by Nutrition branded generics and Diagnostics.
While clearly there has been some softening in emerging markets growth in these economies continues to outpace growth in the developed world and healthcare is growing even faster than overall economic growth in these markets.
National policies focused on expanding access to care and favorable trends including increasing birth rates aging populations and adoption of Western standards and technologies are all driving growth.
Abbott remains uniquely positioned with our diverse set of healthcare businesses to capitalize on these trends from birth to older adults and from diagnosis to treatment in pharmaceuticals and innovative medical devices.
At the same time the strengthening U.S.
dollar continues to be a challenge for Abbott and other multinational companies.
We're thoughtful about how we manage our business and exchange in this environment and we remain focused on achieving the right balance of returns to shareholders and investing in the business to drive long-term growth.
I'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to Brian and Scott and then we'll be back for questions.
I'll start with Diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of 8% in the quarter driven by continued above market performance in core laboratory and Point of Care diagnostics.
We continued to capture share and win new core laboratory accounts with our customer focused solutions.
In Point of Care diagnostics we achieved another quarter of double-digit sales growth.
We continued to expand our presence in key developed and emerging markets and capture share in the U.S.
through adoption of our market-leading i-STAT System in large hospitals physician office labs and remote care settings.
In Nutrition sales increased 6.5% led by growth in our international pediatric business.
In China we again achieved double digit growth driven by continued market uptake of our Eleva infant formula and online offerings in the premium segment.
The international adult nutrition business continues to achieve strong performance including double digit growth in Latin America as we continue to build and shape the adult nutrition category globally.
In Medical Devices as expected our vision care business saw a sequential improvement in growth led by strong performance in our cataract business.
The underlying fundamentals of the cataract market remain attractive and continued market uptake of several recently launched products is driving above market growth.
In vascular sales growth was led by double digit growth of MitraClip the market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation.
And in diabetes care sales growth was led by international performance.
We continue to receive positive response to FreeStyle Libre our new sensing technology that helps people self manage their diabetes without the need for routine finger sticks.
Our capacity expansion remains on track to meet the growing demand for the differentiated product.
In Established Pharmaceuticals sales again increased double digits excluding the impact from recent acquisitions and foreign exchange.
Growth continues to be driven by India Russia China and several countries throughout Latin America.
This business continues to deliver above market growth through improved commercial execution expansion of product portfolios in our therapeutic areas of focus and driving more awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers physicians and pharmacists.
So in summary we achieved another quarter of double digit operational sales growth.
We continue to see strong underlying growth broadly across emerging markets and all of our businesses.
And despite a challenging currency environment we remain on track to achieve our financial objectives in 2015 reflecting the strong outlook we forecasted for EPS growth at the beginning of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian and Scott to discuss our third quarter results in more detail.
Brian? Finance and Chief Financial Officer</strong> Thanks Miles.
As Miles previously stated today we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.54 at the upper end of our previous guidance range.
Sales for the quarter increased 10.9% on an operational basis.
That is excluding an unfavorable impact of 9.5% from foreign exchange.
The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to strengthening of the U.S.
dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.
Reported sales increased 1.4% in the quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in our Diagnostics and branded generics businesses.
As Miles mentioned Abbott sales growth in emerging markets remains strong increasing double digits on an organic basis in the quarter.
Given continued investor interest in the Chinese economy I'd note that our sales in China which represents about 8% of our overall sales increased double digits overall and across each of our reportable business segments.
The third quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.5% of sales up 200 basis points over 2014 and slightly ahead of our forecast driven by continued margin expansion in Diagnostics and Nutrition.
In the quarter adjusted R&amp;D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense was 31.4% of sales.
Turning to our full-year 2015 outlook today we narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance to $2.14 to $2.16.
The midpoint of our guidance range remains unchanged and excluding the impact from foreign exchange reflects strong double digit underlying growth over 2014.
We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the high single digits for the full year 2015.
Based on current exchange rates we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 8% on our full-year reported sales somewhat higher than our prior expectations and reflecting the move that we've seen against the U.S.
dollar since July of various currencies.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2015.
Scott will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.
For the full year we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 58% of sales reflecting gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses.
We continue to forecast adjusted R&amp;D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense approaching 32% of sales.
Overall we expect to expand our full-year adjusted operating margin by more than 100 basis points in 2015.
We now forecast a gain of around $50 million on the exchange gain loss line of the P&amp;L for the full year which is offset by exchange impacts on the operating lines of P&amp;L over the course of the year.
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015 we forecast operational sales growth in the mid single digits.
At current exchange rates we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 6.5% of sales resulting in a low single digit decline in reported sales.
The sales impact from exchange in the fourth quarter is expected to be less negative than the third quarter as we will be lapping the currency effects that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014.
We forecast a fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales.
We forecast adjusted R&amp;D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales which reflects the planned timing of development programs including investment in several next generation diagnostics platforms.
And we forecast adjusted SG&amp;A expense of around 30% of sales in the fourth quarter.
Finally we project specified items of $0.28 in the fourth quarter reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release with the exception of the gain on the sale of a portion of our Mylan shares which occurred in the second quarter.
In summary we achieved another strong quarter and a strong underlying performance and are on track to achieve our financial objectives for the year.
With that I will turn the call over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and our outlook.
Scott? Investor Relations</strong> Thanks Brian.
Today I will provide an overview of our third quarter sales performance and outlook by business.
As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I'll start with Diagnostics where sales increased 8% in the quarter.
In core laboratory diagnostics both U.S.
and international sales increased 8%.
Double digit growth in emerging markets and share gains globally continued to drive above market performance in this business.
In molecular diagnostics sales were led by 10% international growth as well as double digit growth in our infectious disease testing segment.
As expected U.S.
sales were impacted by the continued slowdown of our genetics business as we scale down this business.
And lastly Point of Care diagnostics where sales increased 12% in the quarter.
U.S.
and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT our hand-held device which provides critical information that helps clinicians make quick and informed decisions.
For the fourth quarter we expect global diagnostic sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis.
In Nutrition global sales increased 6.5% reflecting a sequential improvement in growth over the prior quarter.
Pediatric nutrition sales increased approximately 10% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac Advance non-GMO in the U.S.
During the quarter we continued to expand our non-GMO product portfolio in the U.S.
with new launches in the tolerance and up-age categories.
In adult nutrition sales were led by 8% international growth including double digit growth in Latin America.
As expected U.S.
adult nutrition sales were impacted by competitive and market dynamics.
For the fourth quarter we expect global Nutrition sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis.
In Medical Devices modest sales growth in our vascular business was led by 5% growth in endovascular sales and double digit growth in MitraClip.
During the quarter we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mithral valve device market with the acquisition of Tendyne and an option agreement to acquire Cephea Valve Technologies.
Along with MitraClip these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this market.
For the fourth quarter we expect global vascular sales growth to be relatively flat on an operational basis.
In diabetes care sales growth was led by international performance including strong growth of FreeStyle Libre in Europe.
For the fourth quarter we forecast low single-digit operational sales growth in our global diabetes care business.
In medical optics as expected sales increased sequentially over the prior quarter.
Growth was led by strong performance in our cataract business which represents around 70% of our medical optics sales.
Continued market adoption of our premium intraocular lens products including lenses that provide patients with more range of vision options are driving high single digit growth in our cataract business.
For the fourth quarter we forecast mid single digit operational sales growth in our global medical optics business.
And lastly Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD where sales again increased double digits with and without the impact of recent acquisitions.
Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets including Latin America where a broader product portfolio and expanded sales force from the integration of CFR Pharmaceuticals are driving double digit underlying sales growth.
For the fourth quarter we expect low double digit operating sales growth in EPD.
So in summary we achieved another quarter of strong underlying sales growth and are well positioned to deliver our financial targets for the full year 2015.
We will now open the call for questions.
Thank you.
Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Good morning and thank you for taking the questions.
Miles I think people probably first want to hear your thoughts on capital allocation.
On the last call I think people came away from and expecting that Abbott might be more active over the course of the quarter.
Obviously we saw 10.9% but I think people's expectations were a little bit higher.
So can you just give us your current thoughts on business development activity and how you're thinking about the balance sheet? Thanks.
Yeah thanks Mike.
I'd say basically no change from last quarter.
I'd describe a little bit of macro environment.
I'd call it exuberance of activity in this space meaning healthcare in particular pharmaceuticals et cetera.
It clearly came to a halt I'd say mid-summer.
And it doesn't reflect that there aren't the same opportunities or the opportunities that we've been interested in but activity slowed.
I'd say we didn't miss anything.
We're still absolutely as active as we wanted to be.
I might like to have gotten more done too but I think sometimes these things take time.
And we haven't missed an opportunity.
There's one opportunity that went by where I'd say the valuation was such that it obviously was a lot more valuable to somebody else than it would have been to us and I don't regret missing it.
But in general I think there's been a slowing but not so much a change in valuation expectations in some of the businesses out there.
We're still every bit as active and interested.
So on the M&amp;A front I'd say that remains a very high priority.
It's hard to say something gets done within a few months but I'd say we're all going have to just be patient here while it sorts out.
And rest assured we have not backed off one iota.
In terms of capital allocation in general I like our position.
We've got capacity.
We've maintained a strong dividend.
We'll continue to do so.
We think we've got the right balance here in terms of share buyback investment in the business et cetera.
So I think in general all those different constituencies who value some portion of our capital allocation will continue to be satisfied or pleased with what we're doing.
Okay.
And the emerging market performance is obviously encouraging.
People were clearly concerned during the quarter about the potential slowdown in China as well as other markets.
Anything in the quarter that you viewed as one-time whether it be tenders or something that might've benefited the Nutritionals business? Was that a pretty clean picture of your emerging market performance particularly in Nutritionals? Well first let me say I think the emerging market performance was a lot stronger than people expected.
I think there's been a lot of concern about the slowing of various emerging markets in particular China.
And while the overall economies in some of these markets have slowed it hasn't been the same in healthcare and it hasn't been the same in the businesses we're in.
Those have not slowed in the same way.
And so our performance in the emerging markets remains strong in spite of what we might see in construction industries or other consumer areas or I can pick a whole lot of different areas that clearly have slowed or investment has slowed in emerging markets but it's not been so in healthcare.
That has remained pretty strong and I think above expectations and we're gratified by that.
We're glad that's the case.
The single biggest thing Mike as you know that's affected all of us in emerging markets is exchange and across the board.
I mean last quarter was among the toughest I've seen from an exchange standpoint and you say to yourself we got to go where the growth is and the growth is clearly attractive in emerging markets.
It's double digits.
It's healthy strong double digits on the top line and we'd all give anything for strong double digits on the top line and that's there.
But again it's mitigated by pretty strong currency headwind and while none of us are great prognosticators of when that may ease when it does I think that the strength and robustness of emerging markets will really really show.
But in the meantime I'm glad to have the growth of the emerging economies as we do and we continue to be very enthusiastic about them.
That said we have to navigate exchange.
To this point to your specific question about whether or not there's any one-timers here not that I see or I can think of off hand.
I mean everybody around the table here is shaking their heads and nope.
So yeah you're right it's a clean picture and we're pleased with how that picture is developing and there's no oddities in here or whatever.
I'd like to put a one-timer in there of an acquisition here and there and as you know from the first part of your question and we'll see.
Okay great.
Congratulations.
Thanks guys.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi.
Thanks for taking the question.
I just wanted to just focus on the diagnostics business because that has continued to actually perform quite well and just the sustainability of that.
You also commented in the release that you continue to see operating margin expansion there.
Can you maybe just flesh that out a little bit more? Well actually we've been very pleased with the steady growth of that business.
It's been a very strong grower for us frankly across the board.
It's done very well in both developed and emerging markets and I think it's done that with great commercial execution.
It's probably the strongest commercial organization in our company and they've done a great job in terms of their enterprise selling model and improvement of service and so forth and they've got a very healthy and broad pipeline of new systems coming.
I'd say the breadth and magnitude of new products in development has probably never been bigger or better in diagnostics so the coming three to five years here at least as far out as I can see and because I don't know that any of us can forecast more than a year ahead at this rate.
But in any case what they've got coming in terms of new products is going to drive a lot of growth and share gains.
So we're looking forward to the eventual launch of all the different systems and products in development to sustain that growth and we've put that in the hands of a really great commercial team and service team and I think this is highly sustainable.
It tends to fluctuate between 6% and 8% top line growth kind of goes up and down a little bit in cycles.
But in any case anywhere in there is pretty healthy growth in this business particularly in the core laboratory business.
We've seen pretty good improvement in the point of care business particularly as we expand internationally and that's been good.
We've had some ups and downs in the molecular business but I think we've stabilized our plans there and looking forward to how that will go forward.
So I would just say in general it's been a real bright spot for us and a steady one.
On a margin improvement basis they have done a really great job as has our Nutrition business at gross margin improvement.
And while it may sound odd at some point you say gee I think we might be overdoing it here.
Let's invest more and more and more and we're sustaining investments even with this margin which is very healthy we're sustaining investment in a lot of R&amp;D programs and -- that are expensive.
The R&amp;D in this business when you're doing major system development and assay development is expensive and we've got an unprecedented portfolio of things in development and that remains a high priority for our internal investment.
I'd say they are one of the most efficient commercial organizations I've seen.
There's not a lot of waste here and they spend very efficiently they're very effective.
They get great bang for the buck and consequently the margin in this business is just exceptional.
So I'd say they've done a great job and at this point we think there's still room to improve gross margin and so we continue to.
Don't know what else to say about it except it's just very gratifying to see how well they're doing.
Inc.</span></strong> And then I know you had mentioned touched a little bit on the Nutritional margins.
You'd think I mean this year it's been pretty impressive to see if you look excluding currency just on the overall leverage that you've seen through the business into the bottom line.
Do you think that that level maybe not this level in 2015 is sustainable but do you still see the opportunities for leverage going forward? Yeah I see some opportunities.
It's been a focus there now for four or five years and we've seen steady incremental improvement.
Of course early on there's low hanging fruit that you pick and then other things take some investment and some shift in your manufacturing and other things.
And I think that we have begun to see the benefits of a lot of the things that took longer to get at.
So I do I think there's more I do.
Do I think there's another 500 basis points or something? Geez I wouldn't forecast that even if I thought so.
So I think there's still room for steady improvement there.
We have not been dependent on price to get it.
In fact we've been very careful not to rely on that.
I think when you rely on price you don't get at the underlying fundamentals of how you operate your business.
At some point I think we're going to feel the pressure of commodity prices.
We've been fortunate in the last couple of years that we've gotten some great benefit from lower cost lower priced commodities.
At some point that will turn and we've tried to put plans in place to be able to mitigate that when the time comes so I think that will be some pressure on us sometime in the future and we should probably anticipate that at some point.
So we keep our focus on continuing to manage cost input costs et cetera because I think that will be coming someday and we should expect that.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay; great.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
Thank you and good morning everybody.
I wanted to just start with the total top line picture and by just by our own math it looks like the organic growth rate I guess excluding acquisitions accelerated once again to north of 7% this quarter representing the fastest level of growth I think you've had since the spin.
So maybe Miles a) is that correct? And b) maybe you could sort of talk about some of the factors that have come together over the past couple quarters to give you that level of growth and your view on the sustainability thereof.
You're spot on.
The overall organic growth rate if you exclude exchange impact and acquisitions is about 7.5%.
The factors that have driven it a lot of the things that we put in place in our pharmaceutical business our generic pharma business have come together.
We're seeing much better commercial execution.
We're seeing expansion of our product lines in our key therapeutic areas.
You've seen the focus of the business in a number of areas of the world where the growth is clearly helping to sustain the business.
So I'd say if nothing else changed which is not likely but if nothing else changed I think the growth rates we see as an underlying organic growth rate in pharma are sustainable for some time I'd say at least in the mid to high single digits organically and frankly we have ambition to enhance that so we'll see.
They've done a nice job as our other businesses we've discussed also of managing margin and margins.
So I'd say look there's always surprises and there's always something happening somewhere in the world whether it's an access issue or a licensure issue or a pricing issue.
Whatever it is there's a lot of things that will affect this business because if you have the mix of countries that we do business in there's always something volatile happening.
But overall it's been a fairly steady story for us.
You may recall several years ago it was not such a great story and we put some emphasis on all the factors I just mentioned -- commercial execution the breadth of our product lines our relationships with distributors our brand -- all those things to improve that business and actually that's worked and so that's done well.
In Nutrition it's a couple of different stories.
In some places we're doing well and we're satisfied with our performance and in other places we're not satisfied with our performance.
So I'd say while we can say today we're pleased with the solid performance of this business the truth is we're not and we think we can do better.
So I'd say that's a plus to looking forward we believe we could do better there.
Diagnostics I already mentioned.
So I think the probably the one area that I continue to put a lot of thought and effort and focus on our segments of our medical device business.
It's been solid but it's some segments of it are not the robust growth areas that they once were and they're not likely to be.
They are likely to be solid core businesses.
But our issue will be continued incremental improvements in products and then additions to the product lines and spaces around that core.
And that's been getting a lot of emphasis.
So while we're paying attention to the core we also paying attention to how we can enhance and add to it because I think it will be a fairly durable business over the long term.
It's a of course highly profitable business even in the pressures of a different market.
And I think it's a good strong core franchise that we can add to and build on.
So overall I think we'll see the underlying growth that I referenced earlier much more clearly second half of next year because if exchange were not to change – and that's a big if – if it were not to change you'd really see the underlying growth rates of these businesses in the second half of next year although you can see it now if you just do the math.
And I think you'd see that there's some pretty solid good franchises out here because we positioned ourselves in the markets and market segments where the growth is.
And part of that's emerging markets and part of it's particular business segments where there's clear growth.
I think we're going to see some of our businesses like diabetes care surprise people with some growth.
I've got great expectations for FreeStyle Libre.
And as I mentioned our capacity expansion there is well along.
And it won't be long before we'll be able to release more sales of that product which has been hampered by our capacity to produce.
So I think there's a number of things that will sustain growth for us so and I'm pleased with that.
It's the things we can't control like currencies and so forth that are of greater concern.
But we all have that problem and we're all facing it the same way.
And then maybe more specifically on medical devices.
If I look at that business it's still the one that remains a drag on growth despite the overall uptick in performance.
Can you get that back to a mid single digit growth business organically? Or is that the area that requires the most focus from an external investment standpoint? Well I think from my standpoint it requires a fair amount of focus.
If I went back a couple of years ago we were having this kind of a conversation about the generic pharma business.
And there were not a lot of people giving us much prospect of doing better with that business.
And I'd say okay look where it is now.
So I'd say look it's clearly got a lot of our attention.
And I can't forecast for you.
I don't think I should forecast for you what the growth rates are likely to be or what they will be or what it's going to look like when.
But I will say this we are in no way accepting its current standing or status.
It's a strong good business with best in class products in the market.
The market's clearly changed some.
I'm speaking primarily on vascular here because the optics business it's doing well.
I think it's getting our attention.
When we put a lot of focus on something we've generally fixed it and redirected its strategy.
So I'd say we are in that process right now and it's premature to forecast timing or outcome.
Okay.
And then maybe lastly on the M&amp;A side understandably you're not going to give us too much visibility into what you're thinking.
But conceptually as we kind of evaluate the types of deals you might be looking at could you just sort of talk about how you think about the financial engineering cash EPS accretion that's seemed to be quite popular call it six to 12 months ago versus top line growth and ROIC from your vantage point? Well I'd say I start with the strategic fit with the business.
We're looking at growth opportunities and growth comes in a lot of different ways.
If you just start with emerging markets if you put your company in growth markets and you put it in the current of the stream or the flow of business you should be able to do as well as the growth in the marketplace.
So obviously we look for growth segments whether it be geographic or business segments.
And we're in those now.
So I'd say we are looking to add to or expand our footprint in places where we have that kind of growth.
And then you want to be among the leaders in those markets because your ability to drive share gain is greater and so we're targeting areas where there is clearly growth and that means it needs to strategically fit with the businesses we're in.
Now that said there's a lot of ways that fit is accomplished.
If you were to look at the pharma segment there gets to be a blurring sometimes between OTC OTX and Rx and depending on the nature of a given geography or market or distribution channels in that market there's opportunity for expansion there for us.
So I look at strategic fit first.
We're not financial engineering our growth.
We're not looking to be a rollup that's got to go find a few more opportunities every year to overcome last year.
We're looking for fundamentals that drive growth and expansion in markets and there's a lot of healthcare expansion around the world that fits us beautifully and a lot of opportunity for us access.
So our primary focus is on businesses that relate to what we're already in or doing.
Does that mean we would not look at businesses that we're not in no it doesn't mean that.
We'd look at businesses we're not in if they fundamentally have the characteristics that we as a diverse healthcare products company have or look for.
We know what we can leverage.
We know what we can do.
We know what doesn't make sense in our mix.
But we are generally very interested in things that strategically fit what we're trying to do as a company and we're not particularly interested in those that are as you characterized it financial engineering for short term accretion.
I think we're always mindful of accretion.
We're clearly very sensitive about dilution as our investors are.
It's one reflection of price.
It's one reflection of value.
It depends on how long something will take to pay off.
And I think we've been pretty disciplined dealmakers hence probably one of the reasons that we haven't seen as much activity out of us as we wanted to.
You can make a lot of deals out there if you have no limit on what you want to pay.
And I think in this environment you got to put the right value on businesses and that means that your forecast about what a business is going to do in the near to long term really matters and there's a lot of ways to do deal models to convince yourself that what you're doing is a fundamentally good return.
But let's face it at the end of the day we're investing our shareholders' money for growth and for long term sustainability and that's what we're focused on.
Okay.
Thank you.
I appreciate all the perspective.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Matt Taylor from Barclays.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi.
Thanks for taking the question.
I wanted to ask one I guess related to exchange.
It's sort of a two parter but the question is really on number one can you just walk us through your hedging program? Remind us how your hedges were set this year and how further drops in exchange could impact the middle of the income statement and the bottom line.
And then as related to that I was just curious how you think about exchange in terms of being opportunistic with M&amp;A.
You've structured some prior deals where you've done deals in local currency and that's actually benefited you when exchange has dropped.
So just curious if that's something that's on your mind or is more of a minor theme.
Okay.
I'm going to phone a friend here for a little help on some of the exchange explanation but let me generally answer in the following way.
Depending on how you hedge if you hedge your currencies at all it's good for one year.
It's not necessarily so great the following year as your hedges expire and so on.
So you can be opportunistic but at the end of the day we're not currency traders and we're not trying to make money necessarily on currency.
That's not our business.
What we are trying to do is mitigate and smooth the impact of the currency on us so that the changes or swings or fluctuations in currency aren't shocks to the expectations we set for investors or how we budget or plan for our investments in our businesses or the long term continuity of our support of our businesses.
So we look to smooth that impact and to that end we do hedge.
We're thoughtful about our hedging.
We stratify our currencies into three categories those that are inexpensive and easy to hedge and so forth and they tend to be key obvious currencies in markets that you would expect.
There's a middle category where it's more opportunistic in terms of our view of the trade-off of the cost of hedging those currencies and the ability to do and the impact and the volatility and all those things and that's a judgment assessment by our treasury (40:29) group and CFO.
And then there's those that are just frankly either not hedgeable or they're impractical to hedge.
And so we look at that tiering and determine where it is beneficial in our view to try to manage the impact of the currency and then we do it in a rolling laddered fashion.
You can think of them like rolling laddered bonds are laddered bonds or something.
But we do it in a rolling laddered fashion on a continuous basis that is not opportunistic; it's in fact strategic and ongoing.
And we do that to minimize the overall shock to the system of the ongoing effect of currency.
We experience the same exchange markets that everyone else does.
We experience the same fluctuations that everyone else does.
Our longer term strategies affect where we put our plants where we put our R&amp;D where we put our costs where we earn our profits.
Because our best natural hedge to exchange is having our costs in the same places where we earn our profits.
And so we try to take advantage of as much natural I guess hedging as we can by where we invest for plant capacity and so forth and -- but that takes time.
That takes time and so I'd tell you you'd find that the euro doesn't impact us as much as other currencies because we've got considerable investment in Europe that offsets the impacts of exchange.
We're obviously invested in India Russia China Latin America.
We've got a number of capacity investments in all those places that will of course adjust with time.
But that's how we look at it.
I think that the impact of negative exchange on us as a dollar denominated company over the last four or five years like any multinational in the U.S.
has been pretty clear.
It's been a real headwind.
But the growth is in emerging markets.
The growth in those markets around the world is far greater than in developed markets and you got to go where the growth is.
So if you're going to go where the growth is you're going to have to make the management of exchange impact part of your strategy and we have.
Tom anything you would add to that? Finance and Administration</span></strong> No I think you captured it pretty well Miles.
I mean obviously the hedging helps it smooths but it doesn't eliminate currency.
If you look at our EPS forecast for the year this year it's very strong upper single digits and our underlying growth is much stronger than that.
So we did experience some currency this year despite some pretty timely hedging.
It'll help going forward but every year you are still going to have some challenges from the currencies because that's where our businesses are.
And I think there was a second part to question I've already forgotten.
Could you repeat it? Inc.</span></strong> Sure.
Yeah no that's a great first part answer.
The second one was just as currencies shift if there were bigger drops in currency does that change how you think about valuations given those particular countries where then you might have an advantage if you structured it (43:42) Well I recall you asked if we have a philosophy on how we do any M&amp;A in those countries.
Look I think I'd always want to do it in local currencies if possible.
It's not always possible.
So I think there's always an assessment of if you're engaged in any kind of M&amp;A activity in some of these countries with volatile currencies can you do it in local currency or not and it not there is a risk assessment there of how you manage that.
If it doesn't go your way I can tell you there's a few circumstances where I've backed off from opportunities because they were going to have to be done in dollars and I didn't view the risk on the currency as worth taking.
And fortunately it turned out to be right and I was glad I didn't.
But you can't always forecast or predict that and so I think there is an assessment of the value of an investment you make for the long term to add to the company versus what your view may be the currency environment short term.
But generally speaking I'd prefer to do it in local currencies but you're not always able to do that.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Thanks a lot for the answers.
Okay.
Thank you.
Our next question is from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.
Hey guys.
Thanks for taking my question and maybe one on gross margins here.
Really strong incrementals right and despite the FX headwinds that you guys are seeing looks like the increments are really strong.
Points out some structural changes in the business right.
So I'm just thinking sort of what innings are we in on the gross margin side? Well there's two parts to that.
We've obviously improved our gross margins with a lot of internal activity in terms of costs and cost management expense management et cetera and some of that has been in investments in our own production and efficiencies and so forth.
The gross margin has also been impacted interestingly enough by negative exchange.
I mean because it's a mitigating factor when our costs are in local currencies we as we just explained have a bit of a self hedge there and that too contributes to the gross margins.
So you have to break it down into two pieces that which is sort of organic to us and that which is driven in this case by negative exchange and I'm going to guesstimate that's about a 50/50 proposition right now.
I'm looking around the table here for opinion on that but...
Finance and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong> Yeah there's not much impact from exchange this year on our gross margins.
You're seeing the true underlying performance here in what you see in the year-to-date results and what we're projecting for the full year.
Okay.
I stand corrected.
Great.
And then maybe one follow-up on again I think one of the questions I'm getting from investors here is look I mean 3Q was fantastic but as we look at sort of the near term how do we put in context? You have certain elements of your business which are more consumer like versus parts of your business which are much more resilient to cycles out there.
(46:35) So could you sort of compare and contrast how those two pieces play out? Thank you.
Finance and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong> Vijay this is Brian.
So I would say looking forward I'd say all of our businesses look healthy going forward and I don't really necessarily separate it in terms of consumer versus I'll say the non-consumer I mean because we're participating in markets where growth in healthcare has high demand.
If you go back to my comments for example all of our major segments not just Nutrition grew double digits in China.
So we're seeing a lot of resilience I would say on the upstream be that in our diagnostics be in our vascular and our other medical devices in addition to the consumer side.
So you're right the consumer side tends to get a lot of attention and the consumer has been quite resilient around the world.
And you see that reflected in the demand for our Nutrition business as well as our Established Pharma businesses.
But at the same time there's a lot of investment going on in these countries because healthcare is part of their five-year plans or part of their priorities to where they're also making investments in for example private hospitals.
And that's playing very well into the underlying demand that's occurring across our other businesses not just the consumer but across the whole spectrum of health that we're trying to cover here.
Thank you.
Our next question is from - Investor Relations</span></strong> Operator we'll take one more.
Our final question today is from Rick Wise from Stifel.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Good morning and thanks for the question.
Miles a couple of things.
First on the EPD front you did CFR in May of 2014.
Just maybe help us understand is it fully integrated now? Are you fully cross-registered with the products with all the parts of your global business? I'm just trying to gauge where are you in that process.
Clearly you're seeing excellent growth.
And have you achieved all the sales and cost synergies you hoped to? Is there more to come? Just where are you in that whole process? Well I think generally Rick we are pretty fully integrated.
There wasn't a lot of integrating to do to be honest.
The management that was running CFR is still in place.
It's excellent management.
We've had a fair amount of sharing across the board between the regulatory and R&amp;D teams of CFR and the other parts of our business around the world.
We tend to run them in fully integrated fashion in the various geographies of the world rather than functionally from the top.
So CFR has remained fully functionally integrated which is a good thing.
Now we did back integrate our Mexican and Brazilian operations into CFR.
Or actually make that our Latin American organization.
CFR became the core of our Latin American organization and we back integrated Abbott into it.
We did that in every country but in particular Mexico and Brazil because CFR didn't have a lot of business in Brazil or Mexico so we have fully integrated and combined all of that.
I think that's largely done.
I think there's always opportunities for further improvement.
I can't comment on some of the back office stuff because I don't know but generally we tend to integrate our IT and finance systems and so forth over time and my guess is that's probably pretty close to complete but it may not be.
But in general commercially it's fully integrated.
Management's fully integrated.
Abbott we're very happy with the management team.
It's an excellent management team and I'd say it's clearly contributing to our growth and the more we can expand in Latin America the better.
We picked up some other assets in other countries non-Latin American with CFR.
Actually very happy to have those assets too and looking for ways to expand and grow those in those given countries.
So yeah I think that's actually been a real positive.
It was everything we thought it would be and we've been very pleased with it.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Yeah and just a second question on China.
Clearly you've answered some of the concerns 8% of sales up double digits in each segment.
Maybe a couple questions there.
Is this whatever the specifics were of the double digits I don't know if it was low or high teens or whatever how sustainable is it? And what's next in China? You've opened up the sales and distribution centers.
You've launched new products in new categories.
How do we think about growth? And if you want to extend it more broadly in emerging markets but China specifically how sustainable? What's next? Thanks so much Miles.
Okay.
Well I'd say a couple things.
I think the growth opportunity in China remains as attractive as ever.
China reaches up and surprises everybody once in a while in a lot of businesses.
And we've had some experience that way ourselves.
I think there's still a lot of opportunity for us to grow there in the pediatric business.
I think there's opportunity in the adult business.
We have not been pleased with our progress in that business.
And obviously that gets a fair amount of attention.
But I think there's an awful lot of opportunity in China.
I think as a very very large market and because it's China there's always a certain amount of caution about how far one can go with growth in China and so forth.
I think for us there's a lot of opportunity.
Our share position or frankly the size of market in some of these businesses is such we think there's a lot of opportunity.
So for the foreseeable future barring any sudden changes or changes in policy or whatever the case may be I think China is a pretty attractive opportunity for us and it remains so.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.

With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Thanks Scott.
Good morning.
Today I’ll discuss our results for 2015 as well as our outlook for 2016.
For 2015 we achieved our financial objectives for the year reflecting strong double digit EPS growth when excluding the impact foreign exchange and almost 9% growth on an absolute basis excluding the same sales grew over 9% including strong double digit growth in emerging markets and we continued to expand our growth and operating margins.
Overall we made good progress against our strategic objectives.
I would like to highlight few two key achievements from the past year.
In established pharmaceuticals we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia.
The integration of CFR provides the scale manufacturing and portfolio of breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin America and actually number one in many of the markets in Latin America.
And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market.
We also made significant progress improving our commercial execution expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with patients physicians and pharmacies.
In Nutrition we achieved double digit growth and share expansion in China with the portfolio of Pediatric Nutrition products that are customized to meet local preferences.
In the U.S.
we expanded our product offering in the tolerance and up-age categories with the portfolio of non-GMO products providing parents with additional formula choices.
Our international adult nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth as we continue to bold and shape this category globally.
And we achieved another year of significant margin expansion.
In Medical Devices MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million and we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mithral valve repair market with the acquisitions of Tendyne and an option agreement to acquire Cephea Valve Technologies.
Along with MitraClip these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this attractive segment of the market.
In medical optics we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion most notably in the premium len segment.
And in diabetes care we introduced our revolutionary flash glucose monitor FreeStyle Libre in several countries throughout Europe.
Consumer response for this product continues to be very positive and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand.
We also made the progress during the year to bring the Libre technology to the U.S.
with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro our professional use device in June of last year.
And finally in diagnostics the combination of commercial execution high quality platforms and customer focus solutions resulted in another year of above market growth across those developed and emerging markets.
This business also achieved another year of margin expansion while simultaneously investing in the development of next generation system platforms across all three of its segments including the Core Lab Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics.
So we’re entering 2016 with good underlying momentum.
Our businesses have well aligned with favorable long term trends including the continued expansion of healthcare and emerging economy.
While there has been some softening in this economies on a macro basis national policies focused on expending access to care and feasible demographic trends or driving growth in healthcare which is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets.
The fundamentals in the market and geographies where we compete remains strong and we expect to deliver another year of strong double digit underlying earnings growth in 2016.
However a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis and you’ve heard this all weak most notably foreign exchange.
The rapid strengthening of the U.S.
dollar relative to several emerging market currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign exchange will again be a growth headwind in 2016.
We're now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle while we actively worked to mitigate the impact of currency on our results the impact of exchange on our bottom line would be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of currency movements and certain timing effects.
In comparing our 2016 forecast we were mindful of finding right balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term while concurrently making the right choices in appropriate investments to drive sustainable long term growth.
The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela which has been a good market for us for many years.
As many of you know market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging including high inflation increasing price and margin controls regulations on import and slowing demand.
As a result our forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operation in 2016.
Brian will provide more specific details on the impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes.
So for 2016 our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and a lower contribution from Venezuela that I just mentioned.
In this environment we remain focused on what we control.
Our commercial and operational execution our innovations and our efforts to expand margins.
In nutrition our R&amp;D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to our customers than ever before.
We will be opening up several new R&amp;D centers in Asia over the last several years.
We expect continued growth and share expansion in China Latin America and other priority markets including another year of strong international adult nutrition growth.
And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this business margin improvement remains a key priority and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going forward.
In established pharmaceuticals our execution has improved significantly and we’re focused on strengthening our capabilities in key channels and geographies and building a well-recognized added brand with consumers take a permanent role in making decisions about their healthcare.
Internal development programs and local product acquisition are driving a steady cadence of new products in our established pharma business to strengthen local portfolios.
In 2015 our productivity of new product launches increased versus the previous year and we expect another strong year at new product launch productivity in 2016.
In medical devices we expect continued growth and share expansion in our cataract business driven by the ongoing launch and market uptick of our premium intraocular lens product across multiple geographies.
In diabetes care we recently expanded capacities as I mentioned to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe.
And we expect to bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016 targeting in the multibillion dollar global blood glucose monitoring market.
And in vascular we continued to drive uptick of MitraClip and expect to bring it Absorb to new markets through the year.
Finally in diagnostics which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses.
We will continue to execute our commercial strategy to drive above market growth at both developed and emerging markets.
And as we progress through the year we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next generation diagnostic systems platforms as we get closer to launch.
Before turning it over to Brian I’d like to comment briefly on capital allocations.
You always ask me about that and you know that we take a very balanced approach here which rest includes increasing our dividend share repurchases and M&amp;A activity.
Last month we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend marking the 44th consecutive year we’ve increased our dividend.
That is only one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency.
Share repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix.
And lastly while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&amp;A front adding to our business with good M&amp;A remains a key priority.
We see plenty of opportunities and we will continue to remain active on this front.
As always we remain disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit for long term shareholder.
I'm sure you’re going to have a question for me later on that topic.
But overall you can see cash flows remain strong margins remain strong the underlying growth of our businesses remain strong.
In summary the fundamentals of the market and geographies in which we compete all remain strong.
And we continue to focus on what we can control.
For 2016 the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double digit underlying earnings growth.
These impacts while significant are transitory in nature and therefore we remain focused on making the right decisions drive long term growth for our shareholders.
I’ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and 2016 outlook in more detail.
Brian? Okay thanks Miles.
Today we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operation of $0.62 in line with our previous guidance range.
Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis driven by strong performances in our branded generics diagnostics and adult nutrition businesses.
Reported sales declined 3.1% in the quarter including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange.
The negative impact from exchange was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations due to the continued strengthening of the U.S.
dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.
The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales up 130 basis points over 2014 driven by continued margin expansion in diagnostics and nutrition.
In the quarter adjusted SG&amp;A was 29.6% of sales and adjusted R&amp;D investment was 7% of sales reflecting investments in development programs across the businesses including several next generation diagnostic system platforms.
The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat lower to previous forecast due to inclusion of the impact of U.S.
tax legislation inactive in December.
Overall as we look at 2015 we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite difficult environment.
And we delivered strong underlying growth while continue to make significant progress on our margin initiatives.
Turning to our 2016 outlook today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.20.
While this forecast reflects another year strong double-digit underlying earnings growth foreign exchange in the Venezuela dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook.
Let me take a moment to provide more detail on each of these items.
As you know in the third quarter of 2015 several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the U.S.
dollar and have continued to steadily weaken since that time.
Based on the geographic mix with currencies that weakened and the rapid pace at which these currency decline foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015.
Additionally in 2015 our hedging programs served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and volatility.
While our program remains in place for 2016 and it anticipate to deliver some offsetting impact to our exposure.
The benefit of our hedges have naturally lessened over time.
So the follow through from translational foreign exchange combined with these hedging dynamics negatively impact EPS growth in our guidance by little more than 10% for the full year of 2016.
Lastly as Miles mentioned due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela our 2016 forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations.
This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost 2%.
And excluding this impact the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted earnings per share growth in the mid single digits even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier.
As the year progresses we will provide any relevant updates on our business in Venezuela.
I'll now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook.
For the full year 2016 we forecast operational sales growth in the mid single digits.
Based on current exchange rates we'll expect a negative impact at around 4% on our full year reported sales which would result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2016.
Scott will provide more detail on 2016 outlook wide business in a few minutes.
The forecast in adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales reflecting the negative impact from exchange was partially offset by underlying gross margin initiatives across our businesses.
We forecast adjusted R&amp;D investment are somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year.
We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million up over 2015 primarily due to higher U.S.
interest rates and lower forecasted interest income in certain countries.
We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on the exchange gain-loss line of P&amp;L for the full year.
And we forecast around $10 million of non-operating expense for the full year of 2016.
We forecast adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% for the full year of 2016 similar to 2015 and reflect in the effect of the U.S.
tax legislation inactive in December.
Before I review our first quarter outlet outlook I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly earnings growth in 2016.
We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in double digits for each quarter of 2016.
However in absolute terms for foreign exchange in the Venezuela dynamics we'll will have a more pronounced impacts on our results in the first half of the year.
We expect the pace of both sales and the adjusted EPS growth to progressively accelerate throughout the year.
So for the first quarter we forecast adjusted earnings per share $0.38 to $0.40 cents reflecting double-digit underlying growth which is more than the offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution to the Venezuela operations.
We forecast operation sales growth in the low single digits.
And our current exchange rates we expect a negative impact of exchange around 6% resulting in a reported sales decline in a low single digit.
The Venezuela dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter operations sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points.
The forecast in adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales adjusted R&amp;D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter.
And we forecast net interest expense of around $25million in the first quarter.
In summary we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite a challenging environment.
Our business at end of 2016 with good underlying momentum and we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives.
Our underlying earnings growth forecast is to remain strong in 2016 very similar to the underlying earnings growth we saw in 2015.
With that I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights now.
Scott? Thanks Brian.
Today I'll provide an overview of the fourth quarter sales performance in 2016 outlook by business.
As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I'll start with diagnostics where sales increased 7% in the quarter.
In core laboratory diagnostics international sales increase nearly 8% driven by double digit growth in emerging market.
And in the U.S.
we continue to achieve above market performance with growth of more than 6%.
The molecular diagnostic sales grew 3% led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing.
As expected U.S.
sales were impacted by the planned scale down of our genetic business.
And lastly point of care diagnostics where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter.
U.S.
and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT our hand-held device which provides critical information at the patient's side helping healthcare providers choose the best treatments in a variety of care setting when minutes matter the most.
In 2016 we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class model and provide customers with a full offering of solutions to help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care.
We expect global diagnostics sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis with both the full year and the first quarter of 2016.
In Nutrition global sales increased 5.5% sales in the quarter.
Pediatric nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac Advance non-GMO in the U.S.
As expected international pediatric nutrition were all impacted by a difficult comparisons versus the prior year when sales increased more than 25% driven by market uptake of product launches in China and South East Asia.
In adult nutrition sales were led by 10% international growth including double digits operational growth in several Latin American countries.
U.S.
performance was led by growth of venture in the retail and institutional segments of the market.
In 2016 we'll continue to focus our efforts on capturing share with locally relevant pediatric nutrition products and growing and shaping the adult nutrition category globally.
For the full year 2016 we expect global nutrition sales to increase mid single digit on an operational basis.
It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecast for nutrition and established pharmaceuticals.
Excluding this impact we forecast operational sales growth for our global nutrition business would be mid-to-high single digits for the full year 2016.
For the first quarter we are forecasting global nutrition sales to increase low to mid single digits on an operational basis.
In medical devices as expected vascular sales was relatively flat for the quarter.
MitraClip our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation once again grew strong double digits.
And Cephea our innovative endovascular stent continued to perform well.
This growth is mitigated by market dynamics and the coronary stent market.
In 2016 we'll continue to drive market uptake in MitraClip and Cephea and expect to bring Absorb our fully dissolving stent to the U.S.
market.
For the full year and first quarter of 2016 we expect global vascular sales to decline whole single digits on an operational basis.
In diabetes care sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of FreeStyle Libre in Europe.
In 2016 with the recently completed capacity expansion we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more consumers around the world.
For the full year 2016 we expect global diabetes sales to increase double digits on an operational basis.
For the first quarter we’re forecasting global diabetes sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis.
In medical optics global sales increased 2% has strong performance in the cataract business notably in the premium lens segment was partially offset by dynamics in refractive markets.
In 2016 we'll continue to drive updates of our innovative premium intraocular lenses and we expect global medical optic sales to increase low to mid single digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.
And lastly Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD where sales again increased double digits.
Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets including Russia India and China.
For the full year 2015 EPD sales grew double digits operationally with and without the impact of recent acquisitions.
In 2016 we'll continue to broaden our portfolio with globally relevant in products remain focus on successfully building our presence and scale in key countries are focus.
For the full year 2016 we expect EPD sales to increase mid-to-high single digit on an operational basis.
As I mentioned earlier Venezuela has a significant impact in our forecasted EPD growth rate.
Excluding this impact we would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double digits for the full year 2016.
For the first quarter we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis reflecting double digit operational growth excluding the impact of Venezuela.
In summary we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth and are well positioned to maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016.
We will now open the call for questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr.
Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Sir your line is open.
Let's start with Venezuela and maybe you could just give us a bit more in terms of what you're doing one with your operations there; and two the change you're assuming it sounds like you're marking to market the business basically at different exchange rates.
So can you just walk through financially what you're doing? And again why that's blowing the business as much as it is in 2016? Hi Mike.
This is Tom.
I don't – I’ll talk about what's going on for us in the country but I want to make it very clear that we're not changing our exchange rate assumptions for the country.
This is really about what's happening to the market through economic activity of those markets and really demand and ability to pay for products.
The oil price was high at the beginning of the year it declined throughout the year and the top markets became more challenging and we would talk as Scott talked about and Brian talked about significantly lower volume as we exited 2015.
And as Miles indicated in his remarks with price controls very high inflation.
And when we look at the remainder of 2016 going forward we see very challenging conditions and much lower volumes in the country.
So we're focused on supplying the market more focused on medically critical products.
Our products are important to the market but just the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we experienced largely in the first half of 2015.
So that is a situation and I think it will basically take some volatility out of our forecast but reflects the reality of the market we're dealing in.
So two more fundamental follow-up.
So one the Pediatric Nutritional business had a tougher comp in the fourth quarter internationally on optimum product launches and particularly in China.
Can you just separate out for us the tough comp versus the underlying growth and degree to what you think you're seeing maybe slowdown in any of your markets? Sure Mike.
I would say in international as particularly and the slow down we’re seeing on the surface nothing has changed about our underlying momentum here.
If you go back to fourth quarter of 2014 that was the period where we were launching our innovations particularly Eleva and QINTI into the market.
And as you know Eleva has had great success in the portion of the market that it's playing in.
So there is a little bit of a tougher comparison fourth quarter '15 over '14.
If you blend it out in China there on the average Nutrition business grew over the mid teens for the full year.
And so that's more reflective of the performance for this business for a year and it's still ongoing.
We still have the momentum there.
We still have plans for further opportunities of how we compete and how we've been priced to the various channels.
So nothing has changed about the momentum and it continues in the 2016.
So Miles bringing you in here.
So all this discussion the underlying business if we can pull out Venezuela and we can pull out may be one or two other smaller items.
The underlying business hasn't changed but the environment has changed in some places and the price update for prices for assets has changed.
Have your priorities on the capital allocation and the M&amp;A question have your priorities changed at all in the last six months? No.
Let me go back Michael and paraphrase that for you.
The frustrating thing and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S.
based is the underlying market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places.
Every morning we get up we see CNBC.
Everybody brings their hands about China but whether China is 7% growth or 6% growth 6% is way bigger than the rest of the world.
It's a fundamentally strong market for us as our practically all of these emerging markets.
Now the oil-based economy the ones we were extremely dependent on oil take Venezuela – okay there are different stories.
And the volatility unreliability and sustainable market there is different than just about anywhere in the world.
So okay there was an outlier.
And every year there is going to be some outliers somewhere.
And I think if you're in a broad mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies as a multinational somewhere something is not going to be great.
But the fundamentals of the markets particularly for us in healthcare are good.
And yes translating that back during this period it's unusual it's frustrating.
I mean none of this have seen this kind of oil price in couple of decades none of us have seen this kind of currency pile on in a long time.
So okay that said we all know that every multinational CEO has said in the last two weeks in his earnings calls and we all see it we all experience it.
Now going back to your next question has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed? No.
Has my priority changed in terms of M&amp;A activity? I'll tell you one thing about it that's changed a little bit.
We've been looking at properties largely internationally.
And I'd say I'm probably balanced in that a little bit back in other way.
I don't think in the past it was pretty hard in a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals.
And I think there are opportunities there.
But I think as you and others we've watched those valuations over the last year when deal heat turned and I can tell you that there was still one particular one that we were involved in an auction for and the valuation that that property went for we did not win it.
But the valuation that property went for was non economic.
I mean just plain non economic.
I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal.
They obviously have their reasons and they obviously saw something rest of us didn’t appreciate.
I’d say is an understatement but the evaluation are at a level in some cases that you have to question prudence.
And I think at the end of the day while we got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places.
Those valuations when we redeploy the capital on behalf of our shareholders have to make some sense.
And I don’t think that we are anymore and I think we are prudent I think we’re disciplined I think we’ve made good deals in the past.
I've gone through so much of this where I've heard we paid too much we didn’t pay enough we got a good deal et cetera.
But I think some of things I saw last year said but I don't think I mind of losing that one.
I don’t think I've minded not participating that one.
So I think right now first of all I don’t see a lot that people are offering up for sale in effect and you know the old maxim; everything is for sale at some price.
Well the price of some of these things would be for sale at isn’t prudent it just isn’t prudent.
So I think you have to step back and say we’re not in that zone.
We’re not going to be that irrational in some cases and that’s me I mean I hate that I’m going to see some of this in print later but I think that.
So you look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of the currencies we would do a lot of those deals in local currency in fact almost all of them in local currency and I’d say based on where those currency rates are today you could say it’s time this is the time because there is not as much currency rift in a purchase in that particular market et cetera.
But I think if I would think about mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently have I'm not sure investors would applaud further wading toward it just now.
I think there is a prime issue here.
I’d tell you having said that if there was a right opportunity and the right place and I believe that we are strategically very important to us or real opportunity for investors and you know the balance of what we first saw in both of that market in the position currency and so forth.
They are all lined up and the valuation looked good I’d probably do that deal but that was a step up of a lot of ifs right now.
So you’d say what's changed? I’d say where I’m looking and what I’m considering it hasn’t changed it’s just shifted in some of its balance.
I think I’ve got all the same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen but I’m prioritizing some others now that are maybe more important I think in this market this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses.
Now I’ve heard other CEOs say the same thing I’ve heard a lot of people say actually I’ve mostly heard bankers say that it’s a very robust everybody is out there trying to buy stuff market.
I’ve heard it more from bankers than from other companies reporting.
I don’t think there is that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces.
I don’t think there is that many properties I don’t think there is that many assets I don’t think there that much to consolidate.
So I think it’s fairly predictable particularly for an analyst in this space as you are to predict the kind of things that people are going to be looking at there is not a lot out there to consider.
So I think for us we know what our strategic priorities are.
We know what can help our business.
We know where there's real plusses and opportunities and the question is whether or not the other parties whoever they maybe see the same sort of opportunity and we can come together on an overlap of valuation and make something happen.
I know that sounds like textbook platitude but that’s really what it is.
There is a lot of people at the dance looking at each other and trying to decide whether they want to dance but I don’t think there is that many opportunities to be made and everybody is in the same environment where they think their own evaluations are low and they are looking at evaluations from last year that will turn a high and I think you’re in a zone where people are adjusting to what's my value.
And so having said all that am I any less focused on it? No I’m probably more focused on it if anything.
But I’d say we’re also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right timing and so forth because you know we don’t get swept up in deal heat.
We’re fairly strategic about it and I know that a lot of people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the midst of it but I didn’t see anything go by that I felt particularly bad about not being in the mix of it.
I mentioned there was one particular one we were in the hunt on and the evaluation at the end was so high I don’t mind missing it at all.
So I realize that’s a long ramble for you Mike but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I’m thinking about it.
We’re definitely not inactive that’s for sure.
Listen I have follow-ups but I'm going to let some others jump in.
Thanks Miles.
Our next question comes from Ms.
Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
Good morning.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Just to kind of follow up I guess along Mike's line of thinking I know you talked a lot about more from a geographic point of view.
I was just wondering if you could talk more about the balance of Abbott from more of a business mix point of view.
Has the way that you've looked at the mix of Abbott from that perspective changed over the last kind of year or so really since the spin of AbbVie? And if I look at the growth rates for this year medical devices the growth operationally was 1.5.
If that division were to be separated out I just look at Abbott as - it would be even stronger as a company and how do you think about that franchise and strengthening it or just kind of the composition of Abbott today and the future.
Well I think I’d start with that would be all about strengthening rather than separating out but we're committed to all four major segments that we have in the company.
One of the important things about those segments is they are in relative balance in terms of size sales profitability et cetera.
They have all got you now somewhat different dynamics and they have also got a lot in common because the EPD and nutrition globally they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth devices diagnostics I mean there is a lot of different things going on with these businesses.
But I’d say first is balance matters in the mix with the investment identity of the company for a investor because we want to be reliable performer steadily over time.
And as you know our proprietary pharma business avaricely grew to a terrific size and based on one product in particular.
And so we were out of balance as a company and so we split into two companies.
But we got balance in these businesses.
That said you know I’d say from an M&amp;A perspective and the places where we are looking to be perfectly fair we are not looking to do anything with regard to M&amp;A in our nutrition business today.
I mean if something came along opportunistically we would look at everything but the fact is that business is - that’s an organic business for us and all of our performance objectives and things we want to do in the nutrition business globally are organically driven and we think we’re in a good position for all of that.
So the kind of investments that we make in those businesses and we’re a capital plant et cetera in the right market for the world and managing supply chains and so forth.
The other three businesses are each a different tale you know diagnostics I’d say we got a very strong business here.
It’s actually a diverse business.
It’s wanted in a segment of diagnostics and if we opportunistically could add to it we would.
Obviously all the criteria you look at have to make sense but that’s a business where we don’t really have to but if we had opportunities we will.
EPD similar you know we’ve got a gem of a business there and having done a lot of things to shape that business in the last several years we are in the right growth markets we’re in high growth markets we’re in markets where the profitability and the market development the retail facing all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of generics are good.
We’ve identified like let’s say in priority 15 countries in particular that meet our criteria and we’ve got strong positions and most of those particularly important ones and we’re always looking to enhance our footprint in those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets.
Latin America was a great example of that and so there is still many geographic opportunities to do so but I always make the distinction to investors and others that it’s really where we can distinctively differentiate branded generic pharmaceuticals which means retail and channel and so forth right till the end other Latin American countries and so forth.
And so when we have those opportunities it’s great to add on but what we’ve got is core business now a very strong branded generic international largely focused on emerging market business where there is tremendous tailwind of market growth.
So that’s one that’s opportunistic.
And then devices I’d say it’s some of both.
We look at that we’d always want to strengthen that business we do wish to strengthen that business there are a number of ways for doing that and obviously there is organic in-house and then there is our venture organization where we're building a number of small companies who are investing in other early stage companies and so forth and building our pipelines for the future.
And then finally opportunistically there are available opportunities where it fits our market segments and so forth and then there is always M&amp;A.
So we are always mindful of those opportunities.
It gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments.
Would you think about something completely unrelated difference? Probably not.
There are too many opportunities to build or strengthen the ones we have and their needs from a strengthening standpoint vary.
Some have more need to have more breadth of product than others and some are purely opportunistic.
Okay.
And then just thinking about -- I know one of the areas that you've highlighted earlier was building out the capacity for FreeStyle Libre.
What about the U.S.
timing for that and is that going to be a consumer product or is that just going to be more of the physician product? Well I think it depends on what timeframe you're asking.
And it's going to be both eventually.
I mean right now I want the fastest regulatory path possible.
This product has been exceptionally well received in Europe.
Spectacularly well received I should say.
Consumers and users and diabetics and so forth have just given us an over whelming positive response.
So that's good and we're just in the process now to releasing all the new capacity we invested in in the last year.
And we got the next way to capacity expansion underway.
So it's kind of one of those great challenges where I want to play from my own perspective.
The diabetic community in United States wants this product.
And it's a regulatory pacing issue here.
It wasn't so in Europe.
And I would say no more about that but I'm in a hurry because we know the value of the product.
We know the reception of the product.
We know what the physician community reception of the product is.
We know all of that and the value proposition of this product on top of the medical proposition is just fabulous.
I have great expectations for it.
I'm excited about it.
And there is sort of two dimensions to that.
One is enough capacity which for a while we'll have and then we'll have another tranche coming on.
And the regulatory process for how fast we can go.
Any sense on when the first product could hit market in the U.S.? I'm one of those superstitious people that no matter what I tell I'm going to be wrong.
And so I don't want to jinx anything.
So I'll say I would optimistically hope towards this year but I don't know.
Okay fair enough.
Thank you very much for question.
Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets.
Your line is open.
Hi good morning guys.
Miles first question is on the Mylan stake.
I'm wondering if you'll give us an update on this stake.
What you're thinking is -- in the past you've said you're not going to be a long-term holder.
Are you any closer to selling that stake? And will the sale be associated with some M&amp;A? Thanks.
Well good news.
You're right.
We're not going to be a long term shareholder of Mylan.
But the good news is we don't have to sell it right away.
We have the freedom to sell it.
We just don't have an immediate reason to have to.
So I'd say we can leave it in Mylan shares or we can leave it in cash either way.
And you ask if it had something to do with M&amp;A.
Well obviously that might trigger it.
I think it depends on what the price of Mylan is in the market and the manner in which we might market our shares and so forth.
There is a couple of dynamics there but I would confirm.
No.
We don't intend to be long-term Mylan holders.
And well we don't think holding this back is probably trigger of M&amp;A activity.
Maybe a little evaluation but we're not particularly hung up on value right now.
We did watch the entire Perrigo process and hoped for a path and we though until that stabilize and was finished there was no point in being in the way of that.
So that happened that stabilized that's finished.
There is a stable market now for Mylan shares.
And we'll just wait and see what triggers it.
But we otherwise have no reason to move one way or other until there is some trigger like M&amp;A I would guess.
Okay.
Let me just follow up -- If the price were to rocket north we'd probably view that as a trigger too to be obvious.
Let me ask a specific question on your vascular business because if you strip out currency I think over the last 12 months even going forward most of the businesses are on track at least performing in line with our expectations.
But the vascular business continues to come -- at least relative to our expectations continues to come in below.
And I know you highlighted Absorb but a lot of our channel checks are not very positive on Absorb.
So I guess my question is what's the commitment to this vascular business? Is this a business that you need to build up through M&amp;A and the reason why we haven't seen a lot of M&amp;A is it because the targets have still unrealistic valuations? Thanks.
Well I'll say couple of things.
First of all we're committed to the business.
And I think these are the bigger market conditions here.
If you look at the markets around the world not just the U.S.
but literally every major country in the world the markets have stabilized among competitors.
Share doesn't move a lot.
It does moves a little.
The provisions in these spaces -- they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit and that's about it.
The innovation here is at a point where I'd say the incremental value recognized by the healthcare system is limited.
If you think about what drug code it stands for and so forth have done in the vascular space it's been a tremendous boon in the treatment of patients.
But I think now what we see is this market is far more driven by cost and prices in either countries or hospital groups and others trying to manage the overall cost of healthcare.
So I think all of us see the same dynamics where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition than just innovation.
And I think increasingly the payer whether it's government or purchasing people or insurer whatever it is are increasingly more influential here than preference of physicians.
You say well those aren't very good dynamics.
Well they are not bad dynamics either.
We have to compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of other businesses.
And I think we and our competitors in this business are all broadening our product lines or innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings in the space.
And there is still a lot of room to innovation but it may not be specifically just on the stents.
So that - what behooves us is to expand our business and to some degree or to a large degree that is M&amp;A.
And in our case it's been a lot of small-ball M&amp;A and look to expand around those businesses might require to Absorb those kind of things or incremental.
Well MitraClip is very significant that way.
We look at expanding into structural heart or heart failure or other categories and we're trying to build our breadth in those other -- let's say surrounding spaces that way.
I don't think that's very different for any of the companies in this business worldwide.
I think it's been difficult for any market that have been kind of a robust-innovation driven growth that this one did back in early 2000s.
It's a different market today.
It's a different market everywhere today.
So is it a slower growth market? Yes.
Is it still a very attractive market? Yes.
It's still a very profitable market for all participants.
And it's why it gets a lot of pressure from a cost standpoint from payers etcetera.
I don't think that's a secret to anybody.
So while other make it a --performance of the business and say gee it's a little lower expectations.
I'm beginning to think its just robust adjusting our expectations to sort of a reality of the value propositions in the market today.
And so I think it's a very strong business it's a very healthy one in recent that respect.
We still invest quite substantially in R&amp;D and innovations there and clinical trials and so forth.
We get innovations that are in R&amp;D and in the clinical space and a lot of investments around it.
So would it benefit from a much broader footprint? Well it probably would.
The question is how to get to that broader footprint.
And I think the current medical device space broadly defined today there is either a bunch of big companies or bunch of little companies.
There is not much in the middle.
And the couple of things in the middle are extremely highly valued relative to their current performance.
And I think there is a lot of speculation or question about whether or not that kind of value will play out.
So it will just evolve in little time.
We've made a lot of investments in a smaller companies or segments as you know whether Tendyne or Cephea or others to expand our footprint here.
So I think -- I believe in medical device space right now and long term but I don't think it will be the same kind of space it was10 15 years ago.
You had mentioned priorities.
Is vascular higher up on your priority list now? Well that implies it wasn't before.
I would say the device space has always been high on my priority list.
And whether its -- the vascular space or the optic space or whatever this has been high on priority list for a while.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you Miles.
Our next question comes from Mr.
Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.
Your line is open.
Good morning.
Thanks for taking the question.
It's just a one clarification question and then two real questions.
On the emerging market growth in Q4 can you give us the trend of the organic constant currency growth for this quarter please? Yes.
Larry if you look at the quarter and you take out the impact of what we talked about a little bit slow in Venezuela throughout the year we are in the double-digit range for emerging markets across Abbott's businesses.
The emerging market momentum -- Sorry Brian that was for Q4 2015? Q4 2015.
And for the four years as well double-digit growth to the underlying momentum continues in the '16 as well.
Okay.
Thanks for that.
And then so for my two real questions one is on deal size.
Miles you've talked about in the past a sweet spot of $5 billion to $7 billion.
That's one thing you haven't touched upon this morning.
Any color on that? Is that still the case? And then I had one follow-up.
Thanks.
In reality we've got a lot of capacity and it just depends.
We've obviously done a lot of small things and small can be measured in a lot of ways.
I can remember when I thought a $1 billion dollars was huge.
Now people seem to think of that as dinky.
We've done a lot of things smaller than that and also mid size -- I don't feel constrained at $7 billion.
I don't feel constrained at $8 billion or $10 billion.
I don't feel constrained.
So I'd say look if the opportunity is right the strategic fit is right and the valuation is right I don't feel constrained by size right now.
That's very helpful.
And then I hope you understand the spirit of this question because it's kind of a question that we'll probably get today.
But I was struck by your comment earlier Miles when you said every year there is some outlier somewhere when you were talking about Venezuela.
And I think in the past Abbott would absorb those outliers.
So I guess why not now and what can you do to kind of mitigate that in the future? Thanks.
Well I think that's a good question.
And I'd say what we always do everything we can to mitigate.
Here is what's different this time.
Last year exchange was a strong headwind for any U.S.-based multinational across the board.
And I recall at this very time last year from December to now you'll recall both oil and exchange kind of hit kind of sudden hit accepted the oil price drop at that point was a very high level -- much higher level than where we are today.
But there was this sudden hit in sort of late fourth quarter '14 and then in early '15 and everybody scrambled to readjust their ETF guidance for the year to try to deal with what they saw coming as currency and was already happening.
And a lot of companies dialed back to single digit or whatever and laid it on exchange and so forth which was valid.
In our case we said -- we think we can navigate through it and we did.
And we had extremely strong underlying growth in our market as we still do.
And it wasn't just double digits.
It's been healthy double digits all year long.
And so in our case we were able to mitigate and off of lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very differentiated higher growth than many many of our peers even multinational peers not in healthcare.
And what we got now is another year on top of that okay same sort of thing.
And if you look at the exchange rate graphs who would have thought these exchange rate could in a lot of cases be even bigger.
Even bigger exchange rates -- how we want to translate it to have stronger philosophy on the other side.
And then on top of that nobody predicted $25 to $30 oil.
Now that's a curve ball for the whole world.
As so when you throw that curve ball in there it dramatically unbalances the mix of their currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really affect the underlying performance of the country.
So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia.
Now these are countries they are all strong countries for us.
And to different degrees they’ve been impacted by their own oil revenues and therefore their own ability to pay for products.
Now having said that is Russia still a strong market for us? It is.
Do we have the same kind of difficulties in Russia that we have in Venezuela? We don't.
It is a fundamentally good market strong underlying market et cetera.
The only thing it’s not strong is the Ruble which is dramatically weaker versus the Dollar than even a year ago.
And so there is this disproportionate imbalance in the pressures in the currency basket if you will from a little handful of countries where they already had currency translation challenges just like the rest of the world.
Except that they have oil dependence on top of it which amplifies it even more.
And when you start to stack up all of those things you’ll say okay could we navigate through this? And the answer is we could.
I can cut a lot of expenses I can delay a lot of investments.
There is a lot of things that frankly I have the discretion to do.
We as a company have the discretion to do.
And I could then say to you we’ll either have 5% earnings growth or high single digit earnings growth but in our judgment this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing depth of currency walls and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact on its economies that I would look out and say I don’t think it’s prudent to compromise our ability to the laughter all this underlying growth for one year.
In suspect it’s more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions.
It’s more prudent to take that one out and keep right ongoing and I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world the ones that are delivering growth and if you believe in the underlying growth of healthcare and those economies and you believe in the underlying growth of all our products if you believe in Abbott’s ability to continue to access all that growth then my judgment was okay I’m going to roll out of the pocket here take Venezuela out of the assumption.
If I hadn’t taken Venezuela out of the assumptions I'd be telling you right now that you are going to have mid-single digit growth on the top and bottom line.
And you know something you think that was terrific in this environment.
And if you compare this to all the other multination in our phase or frankly other multinational species they’ll tell you that’s right now with everybody else.
So in this case we said if don’t want to artificially compromise our investments in a lot of these businesses whether it’s an SG&amp;A investment or R&amp;D or whatever because of Venezuela.
So I think I’m going to take that one out and keep right ongoing because I believe in the longer term growth prospects of these economies in these businesses and I’m not going to compromise that for couple of quarters in Venezuela so at the end of day could we manage through it? Yes.
And you know this.
If you look back at even 10 years of track record of Abbott it’s absolutely been reliable at double digit bottom line and high single-digit topline unlike almost any other large diverse multinational out there.
We’ve been a very reliable performer that way in a very diverse world.
So I don’t say all that defensively even though it might sound like it.
I look at the world and say man this is like a total different circumstance that anyone of us have ever seen.
And that’s going to make a judgment of how far do I go to push off what we ought to be doing to sort of wait out this oddball storm we’re in.
And I think there’s a lot of people who project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time.
And yet everyone says yes but what is down.
And At what point do these oil driven economies start performing better 60 bucks 70 bucks 50 bucks? There is different thresholds where the performance of economy change dramatically through a lot of different businesses in the world not just us.
In our case healthcare is pretty good no matter what the oil price is.
The dynamics of Venezuela are unique.
They are unique.
And even the Saudis.
Do they still spend on healthcare? Yes they do.
It’s still a very strong important market for us and so is Russia and so on.
So I don’t know that’s a long round of a way of saying we made a deliberate decision.
It was discretionary.
Could I have made the decision to say I’m going to deliver high single-digit earnings no matter what? Yes probably but I’d have had to compromise the underlying momentum and whereas I didn’t think it was prudent.
For exchange yes we can manage exchange.
Venezuela I think it’s more prudent to just take Venezuela out of the mix in terms of what our expectations are and that’s an unusual anomaly.
I challenge back to 2015 we lived through exchange can we live through exchange again? Yes we can.
And the single biggest in difference in our guidance for this year is actually Venezuela.
I don’t know if that answers your question but that was my judgment you know it’s not an inability it’s more of a decision.
If you look at our spending rates and stuff in our go forward guidance our spending rates are healthy.
Very helpful thanks Miles.
The next question comes from Mr.
Rick Wise of Stifel Nicolaus.
Sir your line is open.
Thanks for the question.
Miles hard to resist just asking one more question on Venezuela and I totally understand the point you were making there.
But you sort of said in your last comment that maybe a quarter or two of headwind.
Wouldn't it be more prudent to think this might be a couple of year issue and might be structural? And then just as part of that maybe for Brian is the simple monkey math on this - you're really growing mid-teens some of that 15%.
If Venezuela is a 5% hit to EPS growth and FX is 10% that's what you're really growing on a sustained basis.
Yes let me deal with your Venezuela question first and then I'll let Brian wrap up with close on what he just said about our growth rate.
You know you could be dead right about Venezuela I don’t know but here is the difference for us.
We’re healthcare company and among our businesses there are products that are medically necessary and we have to pay attention to medically necessary.
We don’t have to lose money all the time we don’t have to be irrational for whatever reason but we’re mindful that we’re a healthcare company.
We’re mindful that we have medically necessary products.
We’re mindful that we’ve been in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades and a lot of times in the past in decades foreign companies have exited those countries immediately when the economics turned sour.
And the long term commitment to that continent the governments of those countries and the healthcare systems of those countries they know that and they recognize that.
Abbott has never done that in 90 years in Latin America and we are a fundamentally large healthcare provider in Latin America.
So our judgment was to make these decisions one step at a time as we see how circumstances develop.
It’s a pretty big decision that we’ve taken just to say we’re going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for the year so that our investors frankly you’re getting news today that we’re taking it out of our expectations right and yet all I’m trying to do here is de-risk your expectations de-risk your riding the roller coaster volatility here with that particular country because that one’s unique.
And so we just chose to take it out of the estimates because we know we’re going to continue to have medically necessary products there but that’s going to be in our view at a much lower promotional level even in the past.
So for right now I think that’s the right prudent place to be for that change I suppose anything to change.
I hope the change is more favorably frankly but I’m not listening through the graveyard I just know that they are in a very tough circumstance as a country and they are volatile they are unpredictable and it’s not a very reliable market as markets go.
So I think this is the right step you could say we shouldn’t just go a lot further and I’d say you know you could say that if you were just in some common industrial consumer or whatever good but I don’t think as an healthcare company you can quite do the same things.
So I think we have to be a little prudent here about the medically necessary part that’s why we’re where we are.
And Brain you can address Rick’s final comment about underlying growth rate.
Sure.
Rick when you think about Venezuela and a decision to derisk this and just assume for a second if that’s your reality your growth rate it doesn’t change.
Your growth rate will actually become better as you move through time so nothing’s changed about Abbott’s growth perspective they may even become better.
When you think about what I’ve said and what you’ve modeled in '15 you know that we had mid-teens underlying growth not for the impact of foreign exchange and we take these things that we talked about into account be about the de-risking of Venezuela on what it means to our earnings as well as the FX you are going to get right back to the mid teens.
Rick I think you did a better job summarizing than Brian did Thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions.
