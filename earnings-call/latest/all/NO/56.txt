[Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Doug Bergeron CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and good afternoon everyone.
We are very pleased with the results of our first quarter of fiscal year 2011.
Our Q1 revenues of $284 million were once again the highest in the history of the company a 27% increase over the previous year.
This is the third straight quarter of mid-20% growth rate.
We continue to see the benefits of our new business initiatives as non-GAAP services revenue grew 65% in the first quarter over the same period last year and 22% sequentially.
Q1 is also the first quarter that services revenue as a percent of total revenues surpassed 20% at 21%.
Our non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were at 41% another milestone and our cash balances grew to $479 million at quarter end an increase of $34 million from the previous quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.43 per share 65% higher than the $0.26 per share results last year.
Today I will review our performance by region and follow with comments on our strategic initiatives including the mobile payment space.
Finally I will turn the call over to Bob who will provide a detailed review of the financials and update guidance.
VeriFone's first quarter revenues reflect strong results globally.
North America revenues led the way with 43% year-over-year growth and we saw double-digit growth in every one of our international regions.
I'll talk more about our international results in a few minutes.
But first let's start with North America.
Each of our domestic segments performed well in the quarter driven by ongoing upgrade and replacement dynamics an improving economy and the impact of our transformational services initiatives.
On a year-over-year basis our petroleum revenues increased 30%.
Demand continued to be strong in our direct channel to major oil companies and large independent marketers.
There were several significant developments in our Petro business during Q1.
First we announced and launched an annual software maintenance program for all petroleum clients.
Approximately 25% of our U.S.
space signed up for this service within the first 60 days and we expect a similar number of additions during Q2.
We continue to make good progress with our Secure PumpPAY initiative to address the hundreds of thousands of unsecured gas pumps throughout the country.
Secure PumpPAY installs in Q1 were primarily with large major oil-branded companies wholesalers of fuel.
This is traditionally a sweet spot for VeriFone point-of-sale solutions since many of these companies are multi-branded and we have the network connectivity to support them.
In the quarter we closed deals with 16 of these wholesalers including Tesoro in California Sherman Lewis [ph] in Texas and True North Energy in Ohio.
We hope to have secured 25 000 of the nation's 800 000 pumps by year end and double that again next year.
We also completed initial pilot installations of Secure PumpPAY media our advertising at the gas pump initiative which is now live and working extremely well in pilots with Robinson Oil in California and a Radiant and Risser Oil in Florida.
This service leverages the investment of Secure PumpPAY upgrades by providing fresh feeds of content and advertising to the consumer and a revenue opportunity for the gas-station operator.
It also leverages  VeriFone's significant investments in our digital media sales force.
We expect to continue expanding the pilot through Q2 leading up to a nationwide launch.
Our combined multi-lane Retail business and vertical markets revenue increased 63% on a year-over-year basis.
We continue to win new business and benefit from merchants upgrading the systems to address best-practice security standards.
As we have mentioned before there remains a significant number of national retail chains who were given temporary PCI waivers by Visa and who are now finally upgrading their infrastructure.
As well we are seeing the first refresh opportunities for merchants who upgraded to PCI early in the last upgrade cycle and whose customer-facing solutions are now four years old and in need of replacement.
We also experienced significant expansion in our non-retail verticals specifically retail banking and hospitality.
Retail banking growth is being driven by market share acquisition the overall banking recovery and the need to upgrade outdated solutions posing significant security risks due to being out of compliance.
Our hospitality vertical which includes everything from quick-service restaurants to fast-casual restaurants and hotel properties experienced solid growth due to the ongoing upgrade of a large quick-service restaurant chain.
We are also beginning to see more growth in the Hotel segment as many chains are recognizing the need for increased security due to several recent breaches and process automation to improve the client check-in experience.
Our Taxi business was also a strong contributor to year-over-year growth in North America.
Notably we signed an agreement with the largest fleet in Las Vegas representing 80% of the local market and we continue to expand in other metropolitan areas across the U.S.
Now let me discuss our International business where revenue grew 16% over the first quarter of 2010.
Compared to the first quarter of 2010 Latin America grew 23% Europe expanded by 14% and Asia increased by 12%.
In Latin America we are capitalizing on a booming Brazilian economy and a recently deregulated payment marketplace where demand for technology-enabled payment systems is very strong.
Brazil's economy is now growing at rates equivalent to China but with the added advantage of having an even stronger consumer economy where retailers are motivated to provide the best possible checkout experience for their consumers.
Our shift to a more service-based offering extended to Brazil in the quarter as we signed a multimillion dollar managed services deal with Cosan a Brazilian gas station chain.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues grew 12% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis.
Our team in Poland delivered a record quarter of system solutions revenues.
In addition we saw the first installations of our VX 820 contactless units at PKN Orlen the largest petroleum chain in the country.
Our U.K.
operation also received its first orders for our VX Evolution series products including the VX 820 contactless.
The VX 820 is also in pilot at the four largest retailers in the U.K.
and multiple smaller retail groups that perceive the shift to contactless as a real opportunity to drive customer behavior.
Our PAYware Merchant managed infrastructure and PAYware Merchant gateway is now live for deployment to all U.K.
retailers.
Going forward this will serve as our managed payment footprint for opportunities throughout Europe Latin America and Asia-Pacific.
We intend to implement multiple gateway solutions throughout the world in the coming year in order to drive managed services opportunities content and digital media streaming encryption and better management reporting for our merchants.
Also in the U.K.
we have made significant progress in our new London Taxi business.
Our taxi card payment and digital media solution system has now been fully approved and certified for most taxi models by the London taxi licensing authority [Transport for London's Taxi and Private Hire].
The system which was initially available in a pilot program and is now available for wider release integrates with taxi meters and allow drivers to easily accept credit debit and contactless cards while also streaming digital content to passengers on a 12-inch screen.
We're also launching our VeriFone Entertainment Network to deliver compelling onboard media from leading broadcasters and advertisers through a highly targeted channel.
We now have nearly 1 000 taxis signed up to multi-year agreements and well over 100 of them fully installed in on the road accepting cards.
Our business model in this market involves providing systems free of charge to cab operators in exchange for multi-year agreements that drive transaction revenue based on fair surcharges.
Now let's move to Asia where we posted solid results in the first quarter.
Revenues were up 12% year-over-year.
We continue to drive and develop managed services across Asia to augment our current solutions into vertical markets such as transportation logistics and retail.
In Australia and New Zealand we saw record revenues in the first quarter.
In Australia we are seeing success in expanding into the retail vertical markets.
And in New Zealand we are seeing the benefit of our positioning in support of a market upgrade cycle driven by compliance mandates.
In China Tianjin City Electric Power Bureau selected  VeriFone for an electricity fee collection project using our VX 670 solutions.
We also shipped the first large China order for our VX Evolution series of products to CCB.
We also completed the implementation of our PAYware card management system in China.
The card management system will be used as a platform to offer gift cards prepaid and loyalty managed solutions into the extensive retail marketplace.
A prepaid card pilot will be launched in Q2.
Additionally our pay-at-the-table solution is now being offered as a managed service to our payment gateway in Singapore.
Now let's take a few moments to give you an update on some of our strategic initiatives.
Our Encryption business made excellent progress as a result of the process agreements we signed and announced previously; notably the first data RSA agreement.
We now have signed 30 national retail chains double our customer base in the last three months.
First Data has convinced its alliance partners to make VeriShield Protect an automatic component of Level 4 merchant activation unless the merchant specifically opts out.
We also won our first international encryption deal with CardNET the processor of 80% of all credit card transactions in the Dominican Republic.
VeriFone's PAYware Mobile enterprise solution was selected by the National Retail Federation as one of the top five new technologies at the NRF trade show in January.
With PAYware Mobile enterprise retailers can equip store personnel with smart mobile devices that enable roaming checkout operations so that items can be scanned payment cards accepted and receipts e-mailed to customers or transmitted to a nearby wireless printer.
PAYware Mobile enterprise is the first commercially viable solution to integrate mobile payment devices into a PCI-compliant environment and drastically reduce PCI's scope and the merchant's overall risk profile.
We also continued to expand our network of PAYware Mobile resellers at key merchant acquirers and ISOs.
Elavon Class A certified PAYware Mobile to its large U.S.
sales force.
BB&amp;T Bank is promoting PAYware Mobile within its 1 700 plus brick-and-mortar retail bank branches as well as to its currently installed base of 50 000 plus merchants.
Through our direct marketing initiatives we gained new ISO reseller partners that are primarily focused on the growing mobile payment space.
The growing network of third-party services providers will continue to serve as a key distribution channel as  VeriFone bolsters its range of mobile payment solutions for next-generation smartphones.
Now I want to provide a brief update on our M&amp;A activities.
Last quarter we announced a strategic partnership with Gemalto the global leader in smart-card solutions whereby we and Gemalto would jointly pursue new smart-card solutions based on the global EMV payment standard for the U.S.
market.
On December 31 Gemalto transferred their existing point-of-sale business to VeriFone and Gemalto has been designated as VeriFone's preferred supplier of machine-to-machine wireless modules.
The Gemalto point-of-sale business mainly serves the Middle East South Africa India and the U.K.
and will enhance our offerings in these locations.
Finally I want to provide a quick update on the Hypercom transaction.
On November the 17th we announced the entrance into a definitive agreement to acquire Hypercom Corporation.
The transaction was approved by Hypercom shareholders on February 24.
We continue to pursue the required regulatory approval and anticipate that transaction will close in the second half of 2011.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss in more detail the P&amp;L balance sheet cash flows and guidance.
Thanks Doug.
Before proceeding with the financial review I would like to remind our investors that our distinct spreadsheet for the non-GAAP financials and reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financials is available on the Investor Relations tab of our corporate website at www.verifone.com.
As Doug discussed revenue in some detail I'll begin with non-GAAP gross margins.
Gross margins came in at 41% up one point from Q4 fiscal year 2010.
Change from last quarter reflects a mix shift to its higher-margin Services businesses compared to the system solutions and continued improved system solution margins as a result of material cost savings and product mix.
Compared to the prior quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $2.3 million to $64 million.
Sales and marketing and research and development expenses each increased by approximately $1 million on a sequential basis primarily as a result of a full quarter of expenses related to our Q4 acquisition activity and costs associated with the new Gemalto channel acquired in Q1.
Non-GAAP other income and expenses was a net expense of $3.5 million in the first quarter essentially unchanged from the previous period.
Now let's take a look at our cash flow and balance sheet.
Cash increased by $34 million in the first quarter and reached $479 million.
The primary cause of the cash increase was VeriFone's $40 million of non-GAAP net income.
Also on the balance sheet we're been able to maintain inventory at Q4 levels.
DSO was 54 days an increase from the record low of 46 days in Q4.
The biggest reason for the change was the impact of Gemalto opening balance receivables.
Debt covenant metrics are in compliance by a wide margin.
Details of the compliance calculations can be found on the Investor Relations tab of our corporate website at www.verifone.com.
For those investors evaluating our balance sheet I'll remind you that in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we adopted APB 14-1 also known as ASC 470-20 for the accounting of our senior convertible notes.
The cumulative effect of the adoption is a reported long-term debt that is $22 million below the par value from principal.
Now let's look forward to the balance sheet of fiscal year 2011.
We're increasing our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '11 and now project revenue to be between $280 million and $284 million.
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.42 to $0.43.
On a full year basis for fiscal '11 we're increasing our guidance for revenue to be in the range of $1 150 000 000 and $1 160 000 000.
We now expect fiscal '11 full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 excluding any impact from the Hypercom acquisition.
I'll now turn it over to Doug for some concluding remarks.
Thanks Bob.
There's been a lot of press coverage lately around announcements and speculation about mobile-enabled payment systems based on near field communication technology from the likes of Google and Apple PayPal and Isis.
Isis is a joint venture of AT&amp;T T-Mobile and Verizon that intends to develop a new payment brand and suite of value-added services delivered through a consumer's handset and redeemable at a point-of-sale.
The Isis JV alone represents a market reach covering 76% of U.S.
mobile phone subscribers and a distribution network of over 20 000 retail stores across America.
When you add in the Google Apple and PayPal brands and their respective global reach it becomes quite clear that we're at a tipping point where mobile payments can begin to change the way we pay for goods and services.
But the rate of adoption and ultimate success of any mobile payment solution depends on services providers winning over the merchant.
These merchants won't willingly migrate to alternative payment schemes and value-added services unless they are seamlessly compliant with traditional ways to pay at the point-of-sale and don't add to the complexity and expense of payment acceptance.
Service providers have continually tried to force feed new payment acceptance and security requirements on merchants who have been telling us that frankly they've had enough.
So I want to take a moment to outline six key rules that any new participant will need to follow in order to be successful with mobile commerce.
Rule one: The point-of-sale becomes the hub of systems complexity.
But the cost of deploying and managing all of this new software complexity should be borne by the new services provider who stand to gain the most.
Retailers will not invest on pure good faith.
Rule number two: Consumers must see real value from these new ways to pay.
Therefore to convince shoppers to leave their cards at home electronic wallets must provide things like coupons loyalty rewards or discounts.
These new forms of value add even more application complexity to the point-of-sale.
Rule three: Retailers will not tolerate special-purpose lanes for smartphone shoppers.
Therefore mobile commerce must be streamlined to converge on a unified point-of-sale that is already integrated with other store systems and bank networks.
Rule four: Mobile commerce must become ubiquitous to be successful.
It is unrealistic to assume that special software running at a handful of big-name merchants will force the transformation.
Consumers need the confidence that their phone can be used nearly everywhere to force a sustainable change in buying behavior.
Rule number five: Plastic cards won't disappear anytime soon.
Hence mobile commerce must be integrated with other forms of payments and existing payment systems that are certified by major processors and installed in a vast majority of retailers.
And rule number six: Security must be ironclad.
Even minor setbacks in security real or perceived could compromise consumer adoption and stop the movement in its tracks.
Billions have been spent securing the existing payment ecosystem so new entrants must play by the same rules.
With our large footprint and payments and security expertise VeriFone provides the reach to achieve broad acceptance quickly without adding complexity and additional cost to merchants.
New entrants will be well served to trust and rely on us to integrate NFC-enabled phones and NFC-related services into the global payment systems because our solutions are certified by all major processors and installed in a vast majority of large retailers petroleum convenience stores and small and medium businesses in the United States.
To conclude let me say again that we are very pleased with our first quarter results.
VeriFone came charging out of the gate to start the year.
In the first quarter we posted record revenues of $284 million higher gross margins of 41% and impressive earnings per share growth of 65%.
Every region grew by a double-digit percentage and our services-oriented initiatives made significant advances in the quarter.
Our services have made us a more important partner to merchants than ever and provide competitive advantages for us throughout our full suite of point-of-sale solutions.
We look forward to building on both our customer partnerships and our robust start to 2001 as the year unfolds.
Thanks for listening and we will now open up the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of John Williams from Goldman Sachs.
I'm just curious to get a sense of your organic growth just stripping out some of the acquisitions.
I mean your top line was strong again but I just wanted to see what the last three or four little deals that you've done over the last year and what the actual impact was and what the organic quarter portion of the business looks like.
The Gemalto transfer of business out of the low single digit to $2 million to $4 million in the quarter most of this other stuff that we've paid $5 million to $10 million $1 million here $1 million there.
But it's not really material.
Bob do you have anything to add to that? Yes the actual breakdown of the numbers was pretty small.
And the Clear Channel it looked like that closed right early last year it was before our time.
But it was early last year so is there a year-over-year impact there from the Clear Channel business? Well it's going very nicely so definitely.
But we'd call that part of our organic growth now.
It closed during the fiscal of last year.
So it's in the numbers.
In terms of the year-over-year comp it is having an impact.
You can't really give more? Yes the impact [indiscernible].
The other question we had is on Chip and PIN.
It really depends on who you talk to I guess in the space.
There seems to be a very wide array of opinions and I'm just curious to get your sense on how that could roll out from your side of things.
I mean to some extent you need the hardware upgrade certainly.
But there seems to be a lot of other moving parts so I'm just curious to get a little more color on how you see that playing out the next five years or so? Very similar to NFC.
The easiest part is the hardware either an NFC reader or in the case of the in the EMV an EMV card slot.
What doesn't get discussed often enough is the software complexity that's required by both NFC and EMV that needs to be integrated in the payment system.
In the case of EMV in the United States there hasn't even been a spec developed yet to decide what features and functionality will exist in EMV U.S.
that ultimately we will have to write code to and integrate with all of our existing point-of-sale systems.
Obviously we're strong proponents of an EMV initiative in the U.S.
Number one it would add a huge upgrade opportunity to our existing growth prospects.
And number two there's many places in America 40% 45% where you still hand over your card to an integrated Wintel [ph] cash register solution.
Obviously in the event of EMV all of those cash-register solutions would need to be front ended by VeriFone or VeriFone-like EMV Chip and PIN solution.
So we don't handicap the odds of this happening soon.
We suspect that there's some good reasons in recent legislation that could help this.
And ultimately if fraud can be reduced in the U.S.
that should have the follow-on effect of reducing interchange for retailers which is a good thing for them.
I'd point out that NFC on the other hand -- I'd like to point that the purpose of using that Chip and PIN payment process is already established and it operates in the card emulation run.
A quick follow-up would be it seems as though the networks are embracing in every market but the U.S.
And I'm wondering if you see the potential for the U.S.
to be more a part of call it Chip and PIN version 2.0 which is maybe just Chip rather than Chip and PIN and if there's any impact there that you see for you guys obviously given that PIN pad upgrades would be a big piece of a Chip and PIN reterminalization? Yes there's also a few subs Sahara and African countries that have aligned themselves with the U.S.
in not moving forward.
But we absolutely do think that the U.S.
destined to align itself with Chip and PIN countries.
In fact a lot of the hacking that occurs in Europe of credit card numbers ends up with the result of producing mag-stripe variance of European chip cards for use only in American retailers.
So a lot of the fraud is being exported to America.
But Doug to your point about the Chip only there's certainly as some of the card brands suggest chip only.
But in terms of upgrading our equipment if we do go to a Chip only don't forget that 50% of transactions are debit card and there is a benefit; they have the PIN number available for debit card usage as well.
Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays Capital.
Just a quick question on the petrol market first.
I think Doug you mentioned you expect 25 000 of the pumps to be upgraded by you guys by the end of the year.
Just correct me if I'm wrong but I think you've completed about 6 000 in 2010.
So are you saying incrementally another 19 000 this year? Yes.
So that's an increase.
The last time I talked about this I said we would likely double our success last year.
And now we're effectively saying we're going to triple our success over last year.
And just to further comment on that industry.
I mean you also mentioned that just 25% of the pump -- or the gas operators have adopted the software or new services and software solutions.
Is that around the GAAP accounting changes you had talked about happening in the past? Historically we've been troubled by the accounting that forced recognition of pure product sales over longer periods of time if you sign some for maintenance agreements with the product sales.
So we ended up signing kind of ad hoc pay-as-you-play service agreements with our customers.
Given the recent FASB there's long string of numbers attached to this it gives us the ability to recognize the product revenue but then goes sell a software services maintenance agreement to our customers who -- I've been looking for this as well.
This is a good thing for us and a good thing for our customers.
LLC</strong> I mean so this is an entirely new revenue stream that's coming in this year on the services side.
Is this also a higher-margin like other services? Yes.
We're already doing the work because we're providing this upgrades for free.
So now we're charging for something we're already doing so it's really very high margin on an incremental basis.
And is this a sort of a one-time -- is this like a SaaS model Software-as-a-Service? Or this is more of a one-time one-off and it's upgraded every now and then? It's not one-off.
Now you're paying an annual services fee.
So it's recurring? Yes.
Just another question on the VeriShield Protect product.
I think you also mentioned that now First Data is putting that on to -- correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard you said that First Data's putting it automatically onto terminals or onto the software products they now offer? You have to look at the market in the way that there's level one level two merchants which processers address directly and we are working with First Data and several of the other processors in selling this encryption service to them directly.
Level four merchants the merchants that are largely addressed to ISOs and indirect sales channels and in First Data's case alliance partners are typically small one-lane merchants who have not and still do not remain or do not think about security as the first thing to do when you wake up in the morning.
What First Data has decided since this is a revenue stream for them as well and I think in their efforts to follow best practices and we applaud them for this is to make encryption a standard that comes with the offering to those level four merchants through these indirect channels.
And if the merchant doesn't want it he has to overtly opt out of it.
And that's another recurring revenue stream higher-margin business as well? Yes and those sales have not hit the income statement yet.
This has been a great win for us in the quarter but it will take a couple of quarters to implement all of the technology and all of the necessary touch points to get this properly rolled out.
Last question for me.
When we put all these newer services together collectively with the services you're already offering I mean it seems like the growth there again 60-plus percent can you just help us understand what you expect from a margin standpoint Bob maybe by the end of the year given the higher margin component or nature of these businesses? Again we're still -- I'll let Bob speak his peace in a second -- we're still building out a lot of services infrastructure.
So frankly I would have expected at this point that services gross margins would have been dilutive.
I'm impressed that they are now accretive to overall gross margins.
Over time that's where you'll see the real margin expansion is in the services line because the nature of most of these business models is high fixed costs low variable cost.
When you sign-up your hundredth national retailer on a several hundred thousand dollar a year encryption program it doesn't cost you lot of extra money.
In terms of guidance I gave you the revenue and the EPS and and I leave the journalists to fill in the pieces in between.
But I think you'll see that the gross margins will continue to improve over the course of the year.
Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities.
Just a couple of questions on Europe.
Are you seeing any fall-out from your large European competitors' decision to what could arguably be seen as competing with its customers? And if so can you already start capitalizing on that fall-out? Yes both Hypercom and VeriFone have been witness to the third-player issues with their customers.
As we become more of an entrenched services provider we have still maintained and will maintain a very delicate and productive relationship with all of our processor customers and we find the fact that that delicate relationship in some peoples' minds has been violated has opened up good opportunities for us and for Hypercom and we expect that will continue going forward.
Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Inc.</strong> So when you look at your North American business which continues to be very strong can you give us a little bit of a breakdown as to how much of total North American revenue's coming from petrol and multilane combined? At the top of my head 60% maybe even more.
That's really where we continue to see great traction.
We've got some very innovative solutions in petroleum.
We have with the Secure PumpPAY and Secure PumpPay media solution.
In multilane what has been underestimated for some time was the magnitude of the Visa deferrals which is a huge revenue opportunity for us.
We hope to make some significant announcements over the next couple of months on some big wins there.
And the fact that we were early to market with our best in class PCI solutions back in 2007 is already showing the benefit to us of seeing refresh opportunities from these customer-facing solutions by large retailers who want these systems to look good and behave perfectly in front of their consumers.
So our Retail business continues to do very well and I expect it will do well all year.
Inc.</strong> And just as we think out over the long-term given that distributing piece within the North American business what do you think is the normalized rate of growth at...
I don't know Darrin (sic) [Andrew] because I don't know what normal is Andrew.
We've got a large market share that will continue to give us this kind of base of replacement opportunities.
But we're going to continue to be innovative and innovative last year was taxi and encryption and this year it's media at the pump.
But I can assure you that we're going to continue to leverage that channel and leverage that incumbency and bring new products and services out.
So I don't know -- if we sat on our hands and stripped R&amp;D down and innovation down we could boost margins but probably not sustain these types of growth rates.
With innovation we can sustain I think above trend-line growth rates for many years.
Inc.</strong> One last question I think you just touched on it with regard to encryption.
What exactly is the mechanism that results in revenue recognition? I mean is this something -- I realize that the encryption technologies installed in major merchants what exactly needs to happen to them to I suppose turn it on and start generating revenue? Most of them go through a fairly sophisticated testing program of a dozen two dozen stores.
Unique keys need to be injected in each device.
Until very recently that needed to be either physically done on-site or needed to be done as part of a new system installation.
We recently introduced a remote key injection capability which is enabling a much faster to market capability for our merchants once they sign on.
They need to -- and this is an important part too they need to decide where the data gets decrypted.
Throughout last year the choices were really at their location at TNS at the gateway or at our location.
As a result of our multiple-processor relationships effectively all but two and hopefully all but one in the near term a large retailer can now safely simply ask his processor to decrypt to the transaction on his behalf because all of them will have installed VeriFone decryption appliances.
And that too simplifies the time between signing the contract and generating revenue numbers for VeriFone.
Inc.</strong> And you'd expect a meaningful measure of revenue from that this year? Yes.
I mean I expect these 30 national retailers to grow quite dramatically over the next couple of years.
I expect this level four decision by First Data and others will follow will have a material impact on overall usability.
And there's a tipping point here.
Pretty soon and I think we're not too far away from it you become basically the way this is done in the industry which is what we have been coveting for the last couple of years and why we made this investment.
Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
I wanted to ask a follow-on question on the North America side.
Obviously you're stepping into some tougher comps ahead.
The growth has been pretty strong.
Doug you've been pretty upbeat about the outlook.
But is double-digit growth sustainable in North America here through the balance of the fiscal year? Is there anything on the horizon that could stabilize growth? No I don't think we'll see 43% year-over-year growth.
But double-digit's I think a fairly low hurdle and I'm pretty confident that that's in the cards for the foreseeable future.
It's gone way faster than a lot of the processors we cover.
On the EMEA side Europe in particular very strong.
That was probably the biggest upside surprise beyond North America for us.
You mentioned Poland and I think U.K.
with VX.
Any other product or regions worth calling out to help us better appreciate the growth there? Middle East and South Africa doing well.
Our management team based in the U.K.
is amongst the best in the company.
They continue to take market share from that terminal provider/processor that they compete with in the U.K.
and things are pretty rosy right now.
The great future for us in Europe is the market behaves very much like the U.S.
market.
And once we get the Hypercom deal into the fold we are going to start moving in a much more aggressive manner.
The transformational initiatives that we've been so successful integrating over the last two years in the U.S.
aggressively into Europe.
And my hope is that we can move European growth rates over the next two years to North American-like growth rates.
So similar to that sort of a housekeeping question I guess is it safe to assume Doug and Bob that most of the services growth that we saw sequentially was North America? Yes it is.
But we have very good uptake of gateway-type initiatives in Europe as well.
So we are going to be driving a lot of services throughout the world.
And every region their task was really driving the growth of services revenue.
Let's give them their fair publicity here.
Our Latin America team innovated with a number of great services initiatives this managed services initiative with Cosan a number of services initiatives throughout Mexico and in Brazil.
And our Asia team put up a gateway in Singapore and is really looking to get out of the just direct 101 competition with small terminal providers in China and go up market to provide complex technology and processing services to a wide range of vertical industries that are blossoming within China.
So I think our services story has lots of chapters left and many of those chapters will feature our Latin America our Asia and as I said previously our European teams.
Just for Bob the DSOs and the inventory any trend to call out there for the next couple of quarters? I mean I heard the Gemalto for this quarter.
Does that run down or is this a new norm? Just anything you can share with that would be great.
Well this is the type of DSO that I would expect us to have in general.
But we recently have been doing better than that.
As I said Gemalto was a major cause for the difference as we go forward.
We can't always expect to be shipping as much of our revenue early in the quarter as we did during last year.
But we still shipped a very large portion more than 2/3 of our revenue were shipped in the first two months.
So we're still well weighted to the front end of the quarter compared with many companies.
Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC</strong> Just a couple of kind of I guess mix questions.
So as we think about the guidance in the second quarter and going into the back half of the year it looks like services is going to be really what's going to throttle the growth.
And I'm just wondering as you think about system solutions dropping from absolute dollar levels in the first quarter potentially down in the second and then maybe flat in the back half of the year is that just a replacement cycle that's slowing in certain areas and then the mix shift's going to services? Or is there some other dynamic that we need to be thinking about there? Not really.
I mean we operate in an imperfect world with components that need to be procured and with geopolitical flair-ups in regions that didn't have a flare-up last month.
So we tend to be conservative.
I don't think there's frankly anything fundamental in our business that would suggest a slowing.
It's just conservative guidance around a wild and wacky world in which we operate.
We're very international company.
We're dependent on a lot of logistical partners and we worry about that when we put together our guidance.
So we don't think it's fair to be able to come to our investors at some point and say oh well our guidance assumed everything in the world is going to be perfect.
In the current quarter we have Chinese New Year in Q2 which is a real stop-work order throughout not only China but throughout Asia.
So we typically always have some Asian softness in the quarter be it Q1 or Q2 that Chinese New Year falls in.
But that's really the only thing there.
LLC</strong> And so the back half of the year's growth rate relative to let's call it second quarter's implied because the first quarter was particularly strong is just conservatism.
That's what we should -- that's the take-away? No and I don't want conservatism to mean you shouldn't look at our guidance as real.
Our guidance is real but we operate in a complex world.
We don't ship from deal-break software in California to ship to a California company.
We break software in Asia we put products together in China and we ship to customers in 120 countries in the world.
So we tend to expect that not everything will go as planned.
LLC</strong> And then in the past you've mentioned about the NFC model being one where you'll likely give the product away free and then charge the participants to have access to really the ultimate your network.
Is that still the plan or is that changing? And if so what's the response been from Visa MasterCard as an example which will be a participant in that network? I haven't heard recently from Visa and MasterCard and they're not frankly a customer of ours.
They've set rules for the industry.
What we have successfully been able to evangelize is that in order for this to work is not just a piece of hardware.
It's an integrated piece of hardware and ongoing software and maintenance software.
These applications that are going to be adding a value-centric experience for our consumer and retailer are going to be highly complex and quite volatile.
They're going to change a lot in the first several years.
So what we have said is even if we could we couldn't sell you hardware.
We have to sell you an integrated software services solution that includes hardware.
And that's been resonating extremely well because the last thing retailers want is the additional burden of having to manage all of this complexity from all of these different new entrants at the point-of-sale which is a sacred area protected by PCI and running one of the most important parts of their business receivables collection if you will.
So we've got a great message for retailers that is strongly resonating around the world.
LLC</strong> And then just lastly since we have you on this forum Hypercom put out that 8-K that has some implied values for your growth rates and I mean just for purposes of clearing the air are those your numbers embedded in that? Or are they adjusted by Hypercom DBS? I think the document itself said that those numbers were adjusted and we're not going to further comment on the investment.
Just speaking about Hypercom I would like to add in that we're extremely happy with their recently reported results and we congratulate them and the  team on them.
They showed that they too are experiencing great growth in this industry and we're excited to be with VeriFone as soon as we can get this deal done.
There are no questions at this time.
I will now turn the call back over to Doug Bergeron.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Bergeron CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and good afternoon everyone.
We are very proud of the results of our second quarter of fiscal year 2011.
For the sixth consecutive quarter we’ve posted all-time record top-line results.
Q2 non-GAAP revenues were $293 million a 22% increase over the previous year.
This is also the fourth straight quarter that growth rates exceeded 20%.
We continue to see the benefits of our new business initiatives as non-GAAP services revenue grew 40% over the same period last year over twice as fast as our 18% growth in product revenues.
Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were at 43% a significant 200-basis-point increase from Q1.
Our cash balances grew to $532 million an increase of $52 million from the previous quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $0.46 per share 59% higher than the $0.29 per share result a year ago.
Today I will review our performance by region and follow with comments on our strategic initiatives including the mobile payment space.
Finally I will turn the call over to Bob who will provide a detailed review of the financials and update guidance.
VeriFone's second quarter revenues reflect strong results globally as once again we saw double-digit growth in every one of our regions year-over-year.
I'll start with North America where we delivered 14% year-over-year growth.
We continue to see strength in our Domestic business driven by ongoing upgrade and replacement dynamics and improving economy and the impact of our transformational services initiatives.
Our Multi-lane Retail business posted strong results with some key wins at several national retail brands including Dillards Michaels OfficeMax Phillips-Van Heusen and a large and iconic national department store with 850 stores.
We continue to win new business because we are seen as the unchallenged thought leader in the industry and the safe bet to future-proof any customer's multimillion dollar investment.
Our leading position in encryption mobile checkout and NFC is driving sales success in our core product set.
We saw strong demand in our petroleum business as sites continue to upgrade for PCI-compliance loyalty software and our Topaz user interface.
Our petro product software maintenance program launched last quarter continues to be very successful with approximately 60% of our U.S.
space having now signed up for the service well ahead of our internal plans and up from 25% at the end of Q1.
Sales of our Secure PumpPAY solution continued well in Q2.
Recall that there are over 700 000 gas pumps currently in need of an upgrade as these pumps remain one of the favorite targets for criminals to install illicit skimming devices.
We recently secured 2 major oil wins representing 30 000 likely pumps over approximately the next 12 months.
And Visa continues to remind merchants and acquirers of their liability for such breaches which was effective mid 2010.
Given the recent increases in retail fuel prices cash flow remains a challenge for the independently owned gas stations.
So to ensure success we have recently introduced a managed service program which allows Secure PumpPAY upgrades for a low monthly services fee.
Additionally we have introduced Secure PumpPAY media which allows these upgraded pumps to host full motion video advertising content sold by our existing advertising sales force.
We have a number of revenue sharing plans available to the retailers that provide the potential for turning the Secure Pump upgrade into a net profit center for the retailer.
The initial Q2 pilots of Secure PumpPAY media have gone extremely well and we will expand dramatically in Q3.
We have received encouraging feedback from the market and anticipate very positive market acceptance when the solution is released into the mainstream market in early Q4.
Let me discuss our International business where revenue grew 28% over the second quarter of 2010.
Compared to a year ago Latin America grew 11% Europe expanded by 41% and Asia increased by 25%.
In Latin America we continue to benefit from our market-leading position in the very strong Brazilian economy.
We made good progress on our transformational initiatives highlighted by securing a subscription-based PAYware card management solutions deal in Brazil with Sorocred [ph] a private label brand currently issuing and acquiring more than 3 million cards.
We also received our first large Latin American Vx Evolution order outside of Brazil from Credy Banka Visa in Colombia for both desktop and wireless solutions.
The Vx Evolution platform has been certified by all major customers in the region.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues grew 41% on a year-over-year basis.
In the U.K.
we delivered strong revenues across the retail banking and petro sectors with key wins at Wilkinsons Corney &amp; Barrow and HSBC.
We saw our first Vx Evolution deployments into the U.K.
Northern Europe and South Africa.
This will be the standard going forward offering customers faster processing more reliability and features such as color display touch screens and contactless NFC.
We are seeing a strong contribution from the completed integration of the Gemalto point-of-sales sales group into VeriFone and better alignment of the sales team in France to address the market needs in both the banking and retail sectors.
Our Turkey operation also added the strong year-over-year results -- to strong year-over-year results with several key wins including their first order for the VX 820 to be deployed at Migros the largest retail chain in Turkey.
Now let's move to Asia where we posted excellent results in the second quarter.
Revenues were up 25% year-over-year.
We've introduced the Vx Evolution product across Asia and have received significant orders from Singapore Comfort Taxi the Australian Post and one of the largest retailers in the Philippines.
In Australia and New Zealand we saw continued strong revenues in the second quarter primarily as a result of a compliance-driven upgrade cycle in New Zealand.
We posted record revenues in India with a significant win at ICICI merchant services First Data’s Indian subsidiary and our integration of the Gemalto point-of-sale channel.
Now let me take a few moments to give you an update on some of our strategic initiatives.
Earlier this month we announced PAYMEDIA solutions.
As a turnkey solution PAYMEDIA represents an expansive portfolio of systems infrastructure and services with which ISOs acquirers and resellers can equip merchants for a true intelligent checkout capability that integrates traditional payment with discounts rewards and coupons.
This solution will enable our reseller partners to provide complete integrated solutions that drive consumers into merchant stores by enticing them with rapidly evolving value-added services a monthly subscription-based pricing model eliminates upfront hardware costs and ensures compatibility with new capability and services as they become available.
In Q2 we continue to leverage our strong incumbency in the U.S.
market by expanding our network of PAYware Mobile resellers at key merchant acquirers and ISOs.
Throughout the quarter we gained 43 new resellers of PAYware Mobile.
During the quarter we went live with Elavon and BB&amp;T and continue to see excellent progress as these large financial services providers leverage our industry-leading solution.
In June First Data completes class A certification of PAYware Mobile and will begin marketing the solution as their exclusive smartphone payment solution.
With PAYware's superior reliability and encryption capabilities as well as a superior transaction pricing plan for merchant transactions above $100 we offer an ideal solution for mobile professionals seeking a robust smartphone payment solution.
Monthly transaction volumes on our PAYware gateway now exceed 8 million transactions.
Across our broader gateway solution set we also implemented a fully integrated gateway solution for Citi private label a part of Citigroup.
Regarding our taxi business.
We continue to make excellent progress in the U.S.
as we roll out both electronic payment and advertising to many new cities including Reno Miami San Diego and Washington D.C.
In London we have now quadrupled cabs under contract to 4 000 including one of the larger fleets.
Our goal remains to sign over 10 000 taxis to 5-year contracts by the end of the year.
Our encryption business continues to perform very well and we've added another 10 national retailers since last quarter's update.
We now have over 40 named customers signed on to us to encrypt transactions at over 20 000 retail lanes across the country.
Our backlog has never been stronger and we continue to develop the business.
We recently announced that we are partnering with Google and top retailers to deploy a new NFC-based mobile payment system for trial use throughout the U.S.
The trials are occurring at major retailers including American Eagle Outfitters Foot Locker Macy's and Toys "R" Us.
Google and retailers are using VeriFone's Near Field Communication-enabled point-of-sale systems to power more engaging consumer-friendly transactions.
Our retail presence security infrastructure and brand recognition is key to the success of the NFC offering.
If these trials lead to wide-scale deployment across the industry we expect a boost to our growth for the next several years by $100 million to $150 million per year in the U.S.
and even more internationally.
This is just the beginning.
VeriFone is at the center of the payments evolution and is a critical driver in bringing together new payment innovations couponing and loyalty programs at the point-of-sale.
Over the last 30 years we built the world's leading payments infrastructure developed ironclad security and we will continue to innovate and invest in NFC and in our own mobile payments technology to drive the future of secure mobile commerce.
Now I want to provide a brief update on our M&amp;A activities.
I'm pleased to announce that we have reached a definitive agreement to acquire Destiny Electronic Commerce Limited trading as CSC a South African-based electronic payment solutions provider.
Headquartered in Johannesburg CSC is a leading provider of secure payment technologies services and solutions at the point-of-sale.
South Africa is a very attractive market for VeriFone as the country has a highly developed infrastructure but also has the growth potential of an emerging economy.
This acquisition will provide a base on which to expand VeriFone's Africa business into the company's next $100 million market.
The acquisition is expected to close this summer subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
Finally I want to provide a quick update on the Hypercom transaction.
On November 17 we announced the entrance into a definitive agreement to acquire Hypercom.
The transaction was approved by Hypercom's shareholders on February 24.
As a result of the recent action by the U.S.
Department of Justice we have dissolved our agreement to sell Hypercom's U.S.
business to Ingenico and we are now in serious and parallel negotiations with several alternative buyers.
We continue to anticipate that the transaction will close in the second half of 2011.
To set expectations for the Q&amp;A portion of the call we won't be taking any further questions regarding the acquisition.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss in more detail the P&amp;L balance sheet cash flows and guidance.
Thanks Doug.
Before proceeding with the financial review I would like to remind our investors that a succinct spreadsheet of our non-GAAP financials and reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financials is available on the Investor Relations tab of our corporate website at verifone.com.
As Doug discussed revenue in some detail I'll begin with non-GAAP gross margins.
Gross margins came in at 43% up 2 points from the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
The change from the last quarter reflects continued improved system solutions margins as a result of material cost savings and improved product mix.
Compared with the prior quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $7 million to $71 million.
Sales and marketing expenses increased $2.4 million primarily as a result of a full quarter of expenses related to the Gemalto channel required in the first quarter.
Research and development expenses increased by approximately $3.7 million on a sequential basis as we continue to invest in the key technologies required to support new product offerings.
Non-GAAP other income and expense was a net expense of $2.5 million in the second quarter a sequential reduction of $1 million primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange movements.
Now let's take a look at our cash flow and balance sheet.
Cash increased by $52 million in the second quarter to reach $532 million.
The primary driver of the cash increase was VeriFone's $43 million of non-GAAP net income.
In addition we received approximately $20 million from the exercise of employee-owned stock options.
Also on the balance sheet inventory balances declined by $6 million and days sales outstanding increased to 66 days.
The biggest reason for the change in days sales outstanding was the less linear shipping patterns due to part shortages on some of our product line resulting from the earthquake in Japan.
These shortages were remedied late in the quarter -- later in the quarter than we had hoped and thus some shipments were delayed.
The issues with Japan's supply are now fully resolved.
For those investors evaluating our balance sheet I'll remind you that in the first quarter of fiscal '10 we adopted APB 14-1 also known as ASC 470-20 for the accounting of our senior convertible notes.
The cumulative effect of the adoption is a reported long-term debt that is $18 million below the par value of the principal.
Now let's look forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2011.
Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal '11 is for revenue to be between $295 million and $300 million.
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.45 to $0.46.
On a full year basis for fiscal '11 our guidance is now for revenue to be in the range of $1.170 billion and $1.180 billion.
We now expect fiscal '11 full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.80 to $1.83 excluding any impact from the Hypercom acquisition.
I'll now turn it over to Doug for some concluding remarks.
Thank you Bob.
To conclude let me say again that we are very pleased with the second quarter results.
We once again posted record revenues of -- non-GAAP revenues of $293 million a 200-basis-point boost in gross margins to 43% and year-over-year EPS growth of 59%.
We look forward to building on our first half successes throughout the balance of fiscal year 2011.
Our business remains extremely well-positioned to grow and expand.
Internationally we are mobilized in some of the world's fastest-growing economies.
In the U.S.
and Europe we continue to benefit from security and EMV upgrade cycles and a renewed sense of urgency around protecting against data breaches through encryption.
Our advertising initiatives which began 3 years ago as a small taxi experiment in New York have now expanded cross-country and are positioned to succeed in London and at the gas pump.
And perhaps most materially we are now ready to benefit from a more probable NFC upgrade cycle worth hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several years.
VeriFone has become the critical enabler of payment security payment-enabled media and smartphone-based payment at the point-of-sale.
And together with our industry partners we are reshaping the future of payments.
Thank you for listening and we will now open up the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays Capital.
Just starting off on the services side.
I'd like to just get a better understanding of what percentage of your business now would you consider to be really services-based and recurring revenue more importantly? I mean I think the trends we're seeing on the Taxi businesses is pretty positive.
And now especially with the petroleum side it’s seemingly turning to more of a recurring model with very strong numbers of new pump upgrades.
So would you give us a sense of where you see services -- I mean I know you can see in the numbers now but where do you see it going and then also what percentage of that is recurring? Yes I think it's consistent with what we said over the last several quarters that within the next couple of years I could see services growing to 30% or more of our business.
And you're right in concluding that many of our new product initiatives even product initiatives not necessary services initiatives we’re rolling out as managed services.
In the gas pump market we recognize the cash flow issues around the independently owned gas stations and we're trying to turn what was once a product company into a solutions sale.
So we're very excited by all of this.
Okay that's helpful.
Just to comment for one more second on the petroleum side.
The 30 000 new pumps I mean that's obviously a very sizable number when you talked about I think doing 19 000 this year.
I mean first of all do you actually have the capacity to do that over a period of 12 months? And then second of all when you talked about a monthly fee can you give us some sense of how to quantify that? Yes we will be scaling up the capacity to install these pumps both with partners and internally and that will be a ramp up over 12 months.
It won’t be $2 500 a month starting next month for sure.
But the pricing there's a number of pricing plans out there.
But on the managed service spaces think about $100 to $125 per side per pump with an opportunity to offset some of that with shared advertising revenue and even coupon revenue.
So we think we've lowered the barrier the economic barrier for these retail merchants to become compliant to minimize the liability risk that they have and also give them an opportunity to make some money in it.
Okay.
Just one more question on the taxi side.
You mentioned 4 000 cabs in London now which obviously is a lot higher than the 1 000 you had signed on in the first quarter.
The opportunity there -- I mean is that even generating much revenue yet or is that just a big opportunity for the next few quarters? Yes we have less than 1 000 installed.
And we're rapidly -- we've recently opened up a number of new installation days to meet the above -- the demand that is running above schedule right now ahead of schedule.
So we're going to be ramping up more and more installations per day over the next quarter.
But our hope is to continue to sign and continue to install.
And I think entering into fiscal year '12 this will be an important and nicely accretive addition to revenues and margins.
Okay.
So just last question for me and then I'll get in to the queue.
But...
Well Darrin just before you do that just to add a little bit on the taxis that the percentage of credit card usage in London is tracking I think a little bit ahead of what we experienced in New York back then we're not ready to give out numbers but I would say we recorded our largest fare so far of GBP 600 single fare on the taxi in London.
So it's a 10% markup on that.
So it's a very juicy business.
Yes they're a little expensive over there.
I think when you add up all these initiatives that are seemingly kind of ramping up towards the second half of this year and you compare that to your guidance which obviously was very strong on the top-line.
But bottom line I guess just curious it seemingly looks conservative when you move out to the numbers for third and fourth quarter growth rates.
So is that just conservatism built into your assumptions or is there anything else? We're always conservative.
We like to make our plans.
I think the important thing to note is we are making a lot of investment right now.
We feel that we're at an inflection point of turning this business into something much greater than it ever was and you can see our sequential spend on both sales and marketing and R&amp;D is quite significant.
So I'm very comfortable with the top-line growth.
You're right.
We've got all a lot of irons in the fire here.
Margins have expanded.
I don't think they'll expand monotonically every quarter and you shouldn't expect that.
But we're going to continue to distance ourselves from would-be competitors in many of these markets by continuing to invest strongly in R&amp;D and sales and marketing.
The next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
I wanted to ask I guess Europe.
That was sort of -- that was the biggest upside relative to our expectations.
I'm curious how Europe came in versus your plan.
And I think I ask this every quarter but just impact on demand from FX Gemalto other things? If you can give us some color on what drove the upside that would be great.
Yes FX is not a major contributor.
I mean some of our sales are in dollars some of them in pounds and some in euros.
But the euro moved around a fair amount in the quarter.
But net-net I don't think it was a major contributor.
Bob can confirm that or correct me.
The new Gemalto sales channel is great.
The Gemalto the smartcard manufacturer company has a lot of bank relationships that are now ours and a lot of great people that are now working for Verifone.
So I think that is probably the single biggest reason that we're exceeding plan.
Also our U.K.
business is very strong.
Our German business is doing very well.
And our Scandinavian business is doing very well.
So pleased all around.
We have a great management team both in northern Europe and southern Europe and the Middle East.
Just to be clear then this baseline of $90-plus million is this no risk of pull forward here Doug.
I mean is it a good baseline to assume in Europe going forward? Generally yes.
We don't pull forward orders.
We book them when they come in and sometimes...
Just things coming in a little bit faster maybe from a timing standpoint at some of the pilots that you've been talking about that’s what I meant by pull forward.
Yes.
No I think we're very comfortable with our European results and we think they represent a good baseline for going forward.
Good.
Last one for me.
It's a good summary of a lot of the initiatives and the transformational work.
But just on the Google pilot.
Obviously there's a lot of interest in that.
The $100 million to $150 million that you're talking about can you just give us some sense of what the assumption is there and is that all system sales Doug? And what kind of share are you assuming in terms of participation in the pilot? Yes I mean to get to those numbers we assumed that the pilots are successful and this goes mainstream.
And then when it goes mainstream over a period of 3 to 4 years you would have approximately 15% or 20% of our U.S.
customer base either upgrade to NFC capability or accelerate the upgrade cycle for integrated NFC capability.
So it's largely product sales but we've successfully through these trials has been charging for the various wallets that are coming forward.
None of these wallets are going to look like other wallets.
That's how Google is going to differentiate themselves from Isis from Visa et cetera and each of these wallets represent software at the point-of-sale and we're charging for that and I think people view that as fair and reasonable.
So it's largely a product sale.
There's a lot of software add-ons and we qualify it again.
We don't know if these trials are going to catch on.
We're hopeful.
We're doing everything we can to make Google and the other innovators successful in this.
But at the end of today are consumers are going to move these transactions to smartphones? I hope so but I have no guarantees.
Yes just as a follow-up to that Doug.
I mean how are we going to gauge these pilots? I mean what is can be viewed as successful enough to proceed to the next pilot or as you said mainstream? I mean what should we be looking for? Probably a better question for Google or the competitors to Google.
But I think they're looking to get feedback from the retailers that they're drawing additional traffic that their ticket sizes are increasing that they're experiencing loyalty benefits.
And if they do then I think retailers will see the ROI of -- not so much the incremental cost of upgrading the NFC.
That's not significant.
Just the disruption and the chaos of upgrading your point-of-sale.
People want to think twice about doing that and they want to see some proven value by some of the trials in order to do that.
So I think if that happens we're going to have to also see many of the handset manufacturers get excited by these trials and really follow through on their soft commitments to include NFC capabilities in the handset deliveries starting in Q4 and throughout the first half of 2012.
And if all that happens you've kind of solved the chicken and the egg problem and I think we've got a great opportunity in front of us.
Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Inc.</strong> Doug just to clarify are we talking about a wholesale shift in the revenue model in the Petroleum business? Because I know in the past you kind of talked about $2 500 ASPs and 2 terminals per pump.
Is this -- are we moving entirely to a services model now? We now charge for services in all of our systems in the petroleum industry because it's a very complicated high-touch service model that we need to provide for our customers.
But for the big oil companies we're happy enough to sell you the upgrade and charge maintenance on top of that.
The managed service frankly was designed for the independents that may be flying the big oil flags but they're privately held.
But we're also certainly willing to entertain managed services offerings to the major oils if those deals come through.
Either way we're agnostic.
We want the long-term relationship.
We want to be seen as a technology provider that can be innovative and also flexible with respect to the various pricing models.
Can I clarify one point that that $2 500 you quoted was for both sides? $1 250 per side.
Inc.</strong> Okay $1 250 per side all right.
Because when I look at your sequential North American revenue is down a little bit and I know you've made some comments about higher retail gas prices potentially pressuring demand.
Can you just talk a little bit about why we saw the sequential decline in the systems revenue this quarter? Bob if you could -- you've got the numbers closer to your microphone than I do.
Well as we've explained there are several dynamics going on there.
One is that in the kiosk side we went through a major upgrade of the Ruby and Sapphire products over the last year.
And so whilst the gas pump business itself out on the forecourt is projected to pick up through this year or next year the other is falling off.
So you see some of that transition that we're going through right now.
Similarly level 1 level 2 merchants have been very strong over the last year.
And again we're picking up in that over the future with some really big announcements that we've had and scored that I would say those are the 2 major factors on my systems.
It was a little bit weaker this quarter.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
So I'll ask the same question that Tien-Tsin did about Europe.
If we look at the level of sort of that $120 million quarterly revenue number is that the right base for North America? I mean as we normalize some of the PCI upgrade cycle in Multi-lane or could we see that maybe step down one more time as the comps get a little tougher versus 3Q '11 for example -- or 3Q '10 I should say? Bob? Okay.
So I think that is the right number to normalize going forward for North America.
We've spoken about robust numbers in the out on the forecourt.
So I think you'll see that.
And we have scored some good ones the level 1 level 2 so we're feeling very healthy there.
In the financial services that business has been flat for some time and will continue to do so.
So not expecting much of a change there.
And then as Doug has said most of excitement is on the services side that where we'll be adding revenues for a number of reasons that he described.
It's also important to recognize or take note that all of these multimillion dollar in some cases 8-figure deals that we signed and announced in the script and there's others that we didn't announce are rolled out over multiple years in many cases.
You can't upgrade scores of systems at hundreds of stores in one quarter if you had all the king's army and all of the king's men you just couldn't do it.
So -- all the king's horses and all the king's men -- so you have to recognize that these deals are going to be rolled out over multiple quarters and that adds to the visibility that we have in the North American channel.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
And then just one more quick one if I may.
This was a quarter in which services revenue wasn't as much as a percent of the total as it has been or as it was in the first quarter for example yet gross margin looked terrific.
Does that suggest that as Doug you move toward that goal of 30% services revenue that we could even see the gross margin expand sort of beyond what we'd historically thought about being maybe in the mid-40s up into kind of high-40s level? Yes.
I think multiple years from now the sky is the limit in a sense.
The services businesses have natural margin expansion opportunities overtime because they're high fixed cost low variable cost in their very nature.
And as they represent a higher proportion of overall revenues you're right it'll be very helpful to gross margins.
We’re still early in the transformation.
And on the way to that better world we're also impacted by product mix and country mix and our people buying more wireless this quarter versus non-wireless products.
So I think net-net we've got some good winds at our back.
But I want to be careful to manage everyone's expectations in the short term.
Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson from Raymond James.
Inc.</strong> I was just curious on 2 different topics here.
First you mentioned that if the NFC ramp starts to take off nationally it could be $100 million $150 million incremental to the top line over a period of several years annually.
I was just kind of wondering how do you think about NFC in China and could you give us any -- can you give us an update on how VeriFone is performing in that country? Yes I mean there's a number of NFC trials not just in China but I think Singapore deserves some praise for their almost public government-sponsored push towards NFC.
We've got a number of pilots going on in China.
Turkey and Brazil are both as is the U.K.
all very NFC-focused these days and throughout Scandinavia.
So NFC certainly is not a U.S.-only phenomenon.
The trials in transportation have proven out to be in most markets extremely successful because of the need to get customers through a turnstile or on a bus very quickly.
And you can do it with NFC much quicker than you could with a swipe or otherwise.
China we're doing well.
We had another good quarter.
We're continuing to try to transform our business there from a product business to a higher complexity product business.
So we're hanging around if you will the highly complex transportation projects petroleum projects.
We recently went live with our card management solution there and we recognize at the low end of the market there's internal competition that develop local closed loop products that are not very interesting from a margins perspective but we want to grow our business in a way that's helpful to overall gross margins and growth rates.
So nothing really new to report other than what we've reported before.
I would add to that that it was Chinese New Year this quarter so it's not the most robust quarter.
But it's always this way that quarter and echo the things that Doug said.
Regarding NFC I'd also point out that it's been somewhat impeded over the last year or so because there were some conflicting standards.
And some entities wanted to go with the 2.4 gigahertz frequency and others with the 13.56 megahertz which is what you see in the U.S.
and Europe.
There seems like they're settling on the latter and so I think that's going to help that whole standard accelerate in China over the next year or 2.
Inc.</strong> Okay that's helpful.
And as a follow-up VeriFone continues to make solid progress in signing up domestic national Tier 1 retailers for the VeriShield product.
I think you mentioned 40 now representing 20 000 lanes or so.
Can you give us a sense -- how long does it take to implement just roughly a customer? And how should we think about the pricing in dollar terms? As I recall this is a monthly recurring service fee.
If you could just shed a little color on that I'd appreciate it.
Yes.
The deployment complexity is twofold and I won't be dismissive of this.
Its key injection which we I think announced 2 quarters ago we now can do remotely.
There's some training.
But then the other complexity is to make sure that the processor that the retailer is connected to can decrypt the transactions.
And as we previously announced we've signed up I think 5 of the 7 major processors.
They're in various stages of implementation.
Some are live some are not live some are still in QA.
So depending on that that seems to be the governor of how quickly these implementations go from dormant to live.
But once we're up to 80 90 retailers which we expect we can be over the next 2 or 3 quarters with hundreds of thousands of lanes and all of these processors are live this should be a really great business for us.
Pricing for smaller chains call it less than 20 stores et cetera maybe less than a couple hundred point-of-sale systems you're talking about sub-$100 000 per year pricing.
For medium-sized chains with national in nature but low hundreds of stores you're talking about several hundred thousand to $500 000 a year of recurring revenue.
And for some of the bigger higher volume names the pricing can exceed over $1 million a year.
But these numbers though large in some cases are small in comparison to some of the PCI compliance audit costs that they otherwise would have to undergo.
And certainly they're dwarfed by the impact of the lawsuits such as the ones that Sony and others are going to have to deal with when you're victimized by a breach.
So we still think it's a compelling economic opportunity for these customers and a great value proposition.
We have become the standard.
We see no other real traction with any other solution and we've got a product that people are willing to pay for.
So I think we have several years of great commercial success ahead of us here.
Inc.</strong> Terrific.
And last question any comments on impact to VeriFone if Durbin -- the proposed Durbin amendment is enabled on time or if it's delayed? Does that have any impact on your business? Not really.
I mean it's interesting to watch this from the sidelines.
The First Datas of the world I think are hoping it doesn't get delayed and not amended.
And the Visas of the world are hoping that it does get delayed or amended.
In any case we're providing systems in an integrated world with both debit credit pin debit and now NFC.
And irrespective of how the pricing model or the governors on pricing turn out in the final analysis I don't think it affects our services revenue or our product revenue.
Inc.</strong> Terrific.
I'll add to that.
The one thing to watch which they haven’t announced is the element of the interchange fees that is related to security.
Now that first $0.07 or $0.11 is just non-secure and they have been charged with adding an extra fee on top of that.
And the bill says [ph] it’s got to drive security throughout the industry.
So the mechanism that they use is the thing to watch if they have any impact on driving high security throughout the industry which may be beneficial to VeriFone.
They've indicated that these rules will come out on the latter part of July.
Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities.
This is actually Nick Setyan for Gil.
Gemalto disclosed that its payment business that it sold to you was about EUR 52 million annually or almost $20 million a quarter.
Does that reconcile with what you're seeing? What was the organic growth in the quarter? What Gemalto was doing before really doesn't relate to what they're doing -- what we're doing after.
In many cases some of those products were discontinued but we're selling our products into their customer base.
I think -- I don't have it in front of me but it contributed under $20 million in the quarter certain probably $10 million to $20 million.
That's right.
Yes.
The accountants are kind of nodding.
So it was very helpful.
But long-term what we wanted was these customers to sell our other suite of solutions into not necessarily the Gemalto products and that's important to recognize.
Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research.
I was hoping you guys could shed a little bit of light on the increase in the receivables year-to-date compared to obviously where the balance was at the end of last year.
Bob? So that's all related to that DSO number that I mentioned how the DSOs are up and it's because more of our revenue shipped at the end of the quarter than -- in prior quarters it's been more evenly spread at month-by-month throughout the quarter.
As I indicated that was due to some part shortages that we had because of the earthquake in Japan and it took us a month or 2 to recover from that and make the quarter.
So back-end weighted quarter due to part shortages was the reason for that.
Yes.
It's important to note that bookings didn't look much different than other quarters.
The linearity of bookings -- it’s the linearity of shipments.
We just were in many cases scrambling for workaround components or in some cases where we couldn't find workaround components we had to ship alternative products.
So I give a lot of credit to our supply chain people.
We often take for granted the amount of paddling under the water that goes on in the event of one of these supply chain disruptions and they delivered and I'm very proud of them.
Great.
Now the supply shortages is that all complete or has that been rectified by other means? Or do you guys expect that to continue at all? Yes.
We've -- there’s still some shortages but we've remedied all of them now.
So it no longer will impact our supply chain.
Your next question comes from the line of John Williams from Goldman Sachs.
Just wanted to delve a little bit deeper into the explicit assumptions around the NFC numbers that you guys put out the $100 million to $150 million and then greater internationally.
I was hoping specifically that you can just talk a little bit more about how you guys intend to get paid for the wallet support that you had mentioned earlier Doug and perhaps just give us a little more detail on how that would be structured as far as the revenue model goes.
Yes.
So there's 4 million 5 million lanes of VeriFone customers across the U.S.
and several times more of that around the world.
So we’ve assumed as I said earlier that if and only if the trials are successful then you would expect that 15% to 20% call it 1 million lanes a year would get upgraded with our systems.
In addition to that what we've heard from many retailers is they don't want a VeriFone reader connected to an old VeriFone system.
They would then just as soon upgrade to a new VeriFone solution that has integrated NFC capabilities into it.
So we have assumed out of that million merchants or so that some would buy our NFC reader capability.
Some would upgrade quicker than otherwise.
And all of them would likely want to then enable these new systems to handle multiple wallets out there.
And we know there's -- we know we're working with 3 or 4 of them so we know there'll be more than one.
And what we have said is we'll just charge you once for a software upgrade.
It's $10 $15 per lane for the wallet software.
And over time if you want other wallets we'll download -- remotely download those to you as well.
Not different than downloading an app from the app store.
If you want it you pay for it.
If you don't want it you leave it alone.
And we think that model is going to work out really well for us.
So in essence what you're describing it sounds like a little bit of an end around on the merchant acquirer who would typically be the one providing support for the wallet.
Is that fair to say? No I don't think the merchant acquirer has any ability to work in an integrated environment at the point of sale.
It requires VeriFone to do that.
So these transactions ultimately go through in most cases go through the natural topology of the payment ecosystem and they'll get the transactions that way.
But we're the ones that are coding these applications and these unique data structure sets to meet the individual specifications of each of these wallets so we're the ones that are selling.
Okay.
I guess we can get more detail from you offline.
I guess the other question was -- I don't know if I missed it but the organic revenue growth question that was asked earlier did you guys give that number or was it something that we missed? No we didn't.
Because for a small tuck-in acquisitions in this case a channel not even largely a product set mostly a channel we have not typically given organic growth rates.
I mean the vast majority of our growth since the acquisition of Litman has been organic despite the fact that we make small little tuck-in acquisitions from time to time.
And the next quarter will be the same.
And as of right now the acquisitions that you haven't grown over thus far are which ones? Just to make sure we understand for those of who have modeled those.
I just want to make sure we understand what we should still be accounting for in terms of organic versus non-organic growth.
I think we've been pretty consistent that we believe our business grows long term 10% to 15% organically.
We think we are in a sweet spot right now with a number of interesting initiatives.
So we're quite comfortable to commit to 15% in the short term top-line organic growth and then we'll benefit a little more from tuck-in acquisitions from time to time.
Got you.
Just last question on our side.
In terms of -- I know you said you weren’t going to comment any more explicitly on the Hypercom deal but have you heard anything from the European regulators and have they started looking at it yet or is it something that has not really started? Again we are working to close the transaction as quickly as possible and we're not going to make any more comments.
Your next question comes from the line of Paul Simon [ph] from Aness Crest B Hardt [ph].
I had a few here.
So first of all on the systems gross margin definitely a nice expansion there sequentially and year-over-year.
Should we -- I'm just trying to understand like what's swinging that around -- what's causing that expansion and if this is -- if this 43% roughly is that a good margin to use going forward? Yes I think Bob mentioned we had some good cost savings in the quarter.
Our guys are always squeezing the lemon every quarter.
And we had a kind of a nice somewhat unforecasted benefit due to product -- favorable product mix around some of our higher-margin solutions in the quarter.
Certainly directionally over the next year I would expect some small gross margin expansion from products and some wider gross margin expansion overall due to the increase in services mix.
But I'll say it once again every quarter can't be 200 basis points.
And certainly once the Hypercom acquisition closes we expect for the first 2 or 3 quarters for sure that while we're digesting that business and fixing some of the supply chain opportunities that we see in front of us and reorienting some of the products in various markets that we'll see a step down in gross margins.
But over the long term we think due to consolidation of the supply chain the increased purchasing power that with Hypercom and with increased services we’ll continue to move forward.
Okay great.
And then on the one taxi side Bob made a comment regarding electronic credit card usage in the cabs being ahead of New York.
Could you give us a sense of what it's running at in terms of what percent are using credit card? Yes.
I mean because -- I won't because it's still a low number.
I mean it's low double digits.
But the fact is until we get these 4 000 or 6 000 or 8 000 installed consumers won't have the expectation that the capability is there.
So they won't have the card frankly on top of wallet if you will.
They'll be looking for cash before they get in.
So this will in my mind no doubt over time meet or exceed the New York utilization rates which are now over 60% as we’ve said before largely because the usage in London is much more business-centric because of the cost.
And the average fare is so much higher.
It just makes the use of cash much less practical.
So I think this is an inevitable good story here.
And the surcharge that you're looking at is still 10% on top of the fare? Yes.
I mean it’s less than the allowable surcharge but we have costs as well remember? We pay interchange.
We run a very sophisticated helpdesk.
And in many cases we're sharing some of the fee structure with the fleet operators not a significant amount but enough to get them to hammer on their drivers to push the acceptance of cards.
I've learned in life that if you get everybody's interest aligned it all seems to work a little bit together -- better.
And we’re paying for the equipment as well.
Right the upfront cash is being funded by VeriFone and that's a cost in the COGS line in that as well.
Okay.
Then last question for me.
On anti-encryption you had mentioned last quarter that First Data was making it standard for level 4 merchants.
Have you seen any traction there and most of the conversation so far has been around level 1 and 2? Yes.
I mean they're in the process of finalizing some software and security and some implementation stuff again.
First Data runs multiple hosts.
It's a very large organization.
So sometimes between announcement and revenue there's a lot of oars in the water.
So we're working with them helping them encouraging them and hopefully we get this live for our small merchants as soon as possible.
Your next question comes from the line of Robert Dodd from Morgan Keegan.
Inc.</strong> Just one question it's mostly been covered.
It’s actually the overlap of between Durbin and then the petro side of the business.
I mean there's some big ifs.
If Durbin does happen if the cost reduction get passed on to the gas stations I mean they could be seeing $1 in savings per transaction.
Do you think that would have a benefit to their cash flow? And do you think it would have a material benefit to demand for your products? And on that basis how high could you get capacity in terms of ability to actually install pumps over the next couple of years? Listen if the revenue is there we will get the resources to install these systems.
We still have 9% unemployment in this country.
There's lots of people that would like to work for us who are our partners.
So I'm not worried at all about that.
And I think your point is dead on.
These small businesses that are -- that run 6 or 8 or 10 gas stations would benefit quite materially from that savings.
And I think coupled with the liability shift they would be then in a much better place to upgrade a Secure PumpPAY.
But again we're seeing good upgrade progress already absent that and we're not counting on that as a necessary ingredient for success here.
At this time I'm showing no further questions in queue.
I would like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Doug Bergeron for any closing remarks.
Okay everyone thank you for listening today.
Hopefully we'll talk to you before next quarter with some good news on getting this transaction completed.
It's been long and frustrating for all of us but we're working diligently to get it done.
Thanks again.
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference.
We thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a great day.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 VeriFone Systems Inc.
Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Amesia and I will be your operator for today.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
Doug Reed Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please proceed.
Thank you Amesia and welcome everyone to the VeriFone financial results conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011.
Today's call is being webcast with both audio and slides available via the link in the Investor Relations area of our website and a recording will be available on our website verifone.com until September 13 2011.
With me today is our CEO Doug Bergeron; and our CFO Bob Dykes.
First for the legalities.

These non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for disclosures made in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are presented in our earnings release which is available on our website.
[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Bergeron CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and good afternoon everyone.
We are delighted with the results of our third quarter of fiscal year 2011.
For the seventh consecutive quarter we posted all-time record results.
Q3 non-GAAP revenues were $317 million a 21% increase over the previous year.
This is also the fifth straight quarter that growth rates have exceeded 20%.
Sequentially we had a record quarter-to-quarter growth of $25 million or 8%.
This includes a little over $1 million from our South African acquisition that we completed at the end of June.
We continue to see the benefits of our new business initiatives as non-GAAP services revenue grew 31% over the same period last year significantly faster than our 19% growth in product revenues.
Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were at 43% consistent with our strong Q2 results and up 4 points over the same period last year.
Our cash balances grew to $584 million an increase of $53 million from the previous quarter.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings for the third quarter were $0.49 per share 36% higher than the $0.36 per share results a year ago.
Today I will review our performance by region and follow with comments on our strategic activities including the mobile payment space.
Finally I will turn the call over to Bob who will provide a detailed review of the financials and update guidance.
VeriFone's third quarter revenues reflect strong results globally with double-digit growth year-over-year in each of our international regions and continued solid performance in North America.
In North America sales of $122 million were up 1% sequentially and down 1% compared to last year.
By comparison on a year-over-year basis Ingenico recently reported a 25% revenue decline in their North American segment and Hypercom reported a 13% decline in their Americas segment.
Recall that in fiscal year 2010 we saw full year revenue growth of nearly 30% in North America due in big part to the widely publicized PCI deadline.
So our 2011 comps are difficult.
We had an excellent quarter of advertising and taxi revenue as the summer tourist season kicked in and strong sales into our small business and ISO channels.
Our Multi-lane Retail sales were robust featuring key wins at several national retail chains including Lord &amp; Taylor Eddie Bauer and OfficeMax.
We are taking market share because of our leadership in encryption mobile checkout and NFC.
We continue to see good demand for our Gemstone systems Ruby Topaz and Sapphire in the petro station kiosks as our product innovations and solid performance differentiate our solutions in the marketplace.
However we are not achieving sales volumes at the levels of a year ago when many sites were upgrading for PCI compliance.
The roll out of our software maintenance program for Gemstone systems continues to be very successful.
Approximately 65% of our U.S.
base has now signed up for the service and we continue to -- we expect continued adoption of this program in Q4 and beyond.
Installations of our Secure PumpPAY solution continue to expand in Q3 but sales were weaker than expected due to a challenging retail environment for gas stations.
We remain confident that sales will ramp up over the next 12 months as stations seek greater security at the pump and a share of the advertising revenue that Secure PumpPAY media can generate.
The Secure PumpPAY media pilots have gone extremely well and we are pleased to announce that we released this product into full production on August 1.
Now let me move on to our International business where revenue grew 41% over the third quarter of 2010.
Compared to a year ago Latin America grew 23% Europe expanded by 57% and Asia increased by 42%.
Latin American sales were at record levels with strengths in all markets across the region.
We enjoyed continued success in Brazil where we offer leading-edge solutions in a growing economy.
Banorte in Mexico selected VeriFone as its sole provider for the year.
In Colombia we shipped significant volumes of VX Evolution systems to Credy Banka Visa.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues grew 57% on a year-over-year basis.
Our new Gemalto channel continues to perform well above plan and contributed $16 million in the quarter.
Before counting the benefits of this new channel European revenues grew over 30%.
In the U.K.
we delivered strong revenues in the retail and petro sectors with key wins at Wolseley Travis Wicks and AIB.
In London we have now signed nearly 6 000 taxis to 5-year processing agreements.
U.K.
retailers continue to embrace contactless systems.
They are engaged with VeriFone to gain a greater understanding of NFC and mobile payment with a focus on the 2012 Olympics and capabilities for accepting contactless and NFC methods of payment.
Our Turkish operation posted a key win at Ziraat Bank the largest Turkish bank contributing to strong year-over-year results.
We recently announced that a direct distribution relationship is now available for retailers acquirers and processors in Germany Italy France Spain Austria and Switzerland.
This new strategy addresses the market opportunity presented by giving customers access to multiple new and upcoming products and service offerings directly available from VeriFone.
Customers will no longer be limited to the portfolio of offerings that local distributors choose to sell and support.
We will continue to partner with Point in Scandinavia and the Baltics CCV in Benelux Printec Group and Melon in the Baltics and INPAS in Russia as resellers of VeriFone systems and technology in those regions.
Moving on to Asia.
We recorded excellent results in the third quarter.
Revenues were up 42% from a year ago with growth across the region as we began shipping our VX Evolution products in volume.
As we anticipated our China business was up sharply at 183% sequentially and 22% on a year-over-year basis as we moved from a seasonally weak Q2 which was impacted by the Chinese New Year slowdown in demand.
We also enjoyed some great wins at HDFC Bank in India and Caltex an Australia-based petroleum company.
Now let me take a few moments to give you an update on some of our strategic initiatives.
We've continued to develop new mobile solutions for taxis and buses and self-service solutions for functions such as mass transit and parking.
Working with the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority we will be deploying 1 000 transit pay systems to provide real-time bus information to customers on Staten Island buses.
TransitPAY processes real-time bus location details and shares current status with riders via SMS text messaging website or bus shelter displays to alert riders of next bus arrival time.
TransitPAY is a rugged reliable and secure solution that can transform the passenger experience and can integrate NFC smart phone-based payments and contactless smart cards.
Westbahn an Austrian rail provider has selected our PAYware Mobile enterprise and managed service solutions for use in mobile ticketing validation and payment services as it modernizes the Austrian train service.
This solution creates easy-to-use environment in which all functions and activities associated with payment transactions and configuration are centrally managed.
We continue to make great progress in our Encryption business with named customers numbering in the 50s including recent marquee wins with Dick's Sporting Goods the largest U.S.-based full-line sporting goods retailer with 455 stores in 42 states.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology a federal agency that works with industry in the U.S.
to develop and apply technology measurements and standards has announced in early June their plans to create a format preserving encryption standard specifically calling out VeriFone's own VAES3 algorithm used in VeriShield Protect as part of that standardization effort.
After receiving support of public comment NIST is moving forward with the proposal.
There's still much work to be done: creation of a special publication; subsequent public comment; and ultimately a finalized statement which is expected within 6 to 9 months.
This significantly advances our VeriShield Protect solution as an industry standard for end-to-end data protection.
Visa's recently announced plan to accelerate the migration to EMV contact and contactless chip technology in the U.S.
combined with the industry's interest in deploying NFC technologies creates a unique situation that may stimulate and accelerate terminal upgrade cycles.
It's too early to predict what other card networks will do.
But directionally this could mean a complete product refresh over the next several years representing hundreds of millions of dollars of business.
Our work with Google and Isis continues to progress well.
We are live with the Google Wallet at their initial pilot locations announced in late May.
The next big phase of the Google rollout is currently planned for the end of the month where we go from 100s of locations to tens of thousands of locations.
And just last week we participated in a field demo with Isis the telecommunications carrier JV that plans to bring their mobile payment capability to the point of sale throughout 2012.
And recently we have made great progress with PayPal who plan on using VeriFone to enable hundreds of thousands of merchants to accept PayPal PIN and PayPal NFC over the months and years to come.
As I mentioned last quarter if these initial rollouts lead to wide-scale deployment across the industry we expect a boost to our revenue for the next several years by $100 million to $150 million per year in the U.S.
and even more internationally.
VeriFone continues our focus on innovation to remain at the center of the continuing payments evolution and redefining the point of sale as an intelligent point of interaction combining payment and media.
Now I want to provide a brief update on our M&amp;A activities.
I'm very excited to announce that we closed the Hypercom transaction on August the 4th.
This acquisition enables tremendous geographical and product and services diversification.
Hypercom's presence in a number of important markets enables VeriFone to accelerate overseas growth increase innovation and build value for customers employees and shareholders.
We plan to grow and enhance all major product lines that existed prior to completing the acquisition bolstered with the strong VeriFone brand identity.
In the quarter we also closed the acquisition of CSC a South African-based systems and software provider.
South Africa is a very attractive market for VeriFone and will provide a base on which to expand our African business to better address a large and growing market.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss in more detail the P&amp;L balance sheet cash flows and guidance.
Thanks Doug.
Before proceeding with the financial review I would like to remind our investors that a succinct spreadsheet of our non-GAAP financials and reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financials is available on the Investor Relations tab of our corporate website at www.verifone.com.
As Doug discussed revenue in some detail I'll begin with non-GAAP gross margins.
Gross margins came in at 43% basically unchanged from our second quarter of fiscal year 2011.
Compared with the prior quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $3 million to $74 million.
Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $1 million primarily to support higher revenue volumes and new product releases.
Research and development expenses increased by approximately $2 million on a sequential basis as we continue to invest in the key technologies and certifications required to support VX Evolution product offerings.
Non-GAAP other income and expense was a net expense of $3.1 million in the third quarter a sequential expense increase of $0.6 million mainly as a result of favorable foreign exchange movements in Q2 that did not recur in the third quarter.
Now let's take a look at our cash flow and balance sheet.
Cash increased $53 million in the third quarter to reach $584 million a noteworthy increase of over $180 million from Q3 fiscal '10.
The primary driver of this quarter's cash increase was VeriFone's $46 million of non-GAAP net income.
Proceeds from option exercises contributed only $4 million in Q3 versus $21 million in Q2.
Elsewhere on the balance sheet inventory balances increased by $3.5 million and days sales outstanding decreased a day to 65 days.
Let's now look forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2011.
Our improved guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '11 is for non-GAAP revenue to be between $395 million and $400 million.
We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share expectations to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.50.
On a full year basis for fiscal '11 our guidance is now for non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.289 billion and $1.294 billion.
We now expect fiscal '11 full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.88 to $1.89.
We will provide full year fiscal '12 guidance as has been the custom at our fiscal '11 year-end report on the next call.
I will now turn it over to Doug Bergeron for some concluding remarks.
Thanks Bob.
To conclude let me say again that we are very pleased with our third quarter results.
We once again posted record revenue this time of $317 million solid gross margins of 43% and year-over-year earnings per share growth of 36%.
The closing of the Hypercom acquisition positions us incredibly well.
VeriFone is stronger than at any point in our 30-year history.
We will continue to aggressively grow and expand both geographically and in our product offerings.
We are already well on our way to driving significant operating synergies to the elimination of overlapping expenses and through business process reengineering and we are optimistic of our ability to drive gross margin improvements due to our larger and very well-managed supply chain capabilities.
Thank you for listening and we will now open up the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.
First question just any sense of the decision-making.
Are you seeing any signs of decision-making by customers whether it's in Europe or the U.S.? And maybe perhaps also Doug if you can give us a sense of the types of revenue you think would be more resilient now through the downturn of the economy versus maybe what you've seen in prior cycles.
It would be very helpful.
Frankly and I stand to be corrected in future calls perhaps but we haven't seen the friction in the financial markets spread at all to our book of business or to our customers' attitude or confidence in their future.
Much of our business is driven by innovation by the need to become compliant for security increasingly throughout the world by contactless and NFC.
This may change if things got a lot worse.
But so far we really are viewing this as a Wall Street issue not a customer confidence issue.
I would just add to that that our revenue in Greece grew quarter-to-quarter quite substantially.
So even in very weak markets the need for merchants to upgrade their systems and maintain their base systems is clearly supersedes the general economic trends.
Okay.
That's helpful.
One follow-up to that.
When we looked at prior fourth quarters VeriFone's had sequential increases in revenues versus third quarter levels.
Your guidance is calling for I think $395 million to $400 million of revenue which you seem to pick for sure.
But if you back out the quarterly run rate of Hypercom's revenue I think you told us $350 million per year then the sequential change is actually not an increase.
So with taxi accelerating potentially and correct me if I'm wrong but if taxi in London accelerating petro maybe accelerating and organic trends still seemingly sound is there any reason we shouldn't think that fourth quarter numbers or your guidance is very conservative? Well I think it's been extremely consistent here that our guidance following a record quarter has been effectively to repeat the record quarter.
You're comparing actuals which we admit have had a tendency to exceed guidance but I see nothing to be ashamed of guiding to another -- to basically repeat the organic success that we had this quarter followed by the first quarter of Hypercom.
And listen we don't have that type of visibility yet into the Hypercom book of business that you would expect us to have 2 or 3 quarters from now.
So I guess I have to ask you to cut us a little slack to get ahead of that.
We think given all that's happening inside with integration these are good numbers and yes we hope to beat them someday too.
I would expect that $350 million to be uniform over that year so you could assume a little bit weaker Hypercom in that number.
Yes.
Out of the gate exactly.
Just one last question for me and I'll move back to the queue is when you look at some of the new initiatives I mean obviously you've had some great success in the taxi business and the encryption business so far.
You touched on a new -- it sounded like more of a newer initiative with the MTA.
I mean can you give us a little more color on what exactly that is? And is there any opportunity for that to build out beyond just the New York City buses? Yes I think it's consistent with many aspects of our business that have morphed into full systems integration and solution sales that combine our unique position with ruggedized terminal technology with gateways and sophisticated software that we write and then manage total project over time.
We had announced success in the past.
This is not new in Cancún Mexico; in Turkey and this recent success in the first of 6 boroughs in New York is -- first of 5 boroughs in New York is something that we're quite proud of.
I don't think it's another major growth driver Darrin.
It's just I think emblematic of how our business is evolving into a higher end software and solutions business versus just a terminal business.
And Hypercom gives us more strength in that area also.
They have some products uniquely designed for the unattended space.
And the next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.
Just a follow up to Darrin's question and maybe just on North America.
I'm curious how that came in relative to plan.
Obviously you are taking share from the other guys.
But I'm curious if you saw any change in buying behavior throughout the course of the quarter and in the more recent weeks.
We saw a little improvement -- unanticipated improvement in the ISO channel.
First Data stepped up by more VeriFone-branded solutions which continued good success in multi-lane.
Perhaps we didn't do a good enough job early in the year reminding stakeholders that our 10% steady-state growth rates in North America were operationally high in 2010.
I think it grew by around 30% and that this year to keep even with last year would have been a Herculean feat requiring some market share increases which we've done.
But we expect North American growth going forward.
It's probably flat again -- flattish again in the fourth quarter but returning to more normalized growth rates in 2012.
And again as I mentioned to Darrin we haven't seen any of this financial market turmoil spread into our customers' buying attitudes or trends so far.
And I'd also point out in terms of taking market share that we said in our formal remarks that Hypercom went actually down 13% and Ingenico 25%.
So clearly by staying about flat we are gaining market share in North America.
Sure.
Yes I mean yes and plus the comp is obviously tough and will be tough in the fourth quarter.
That's good to know.
And just from a modeling standpoint can we get some help in the gross margin and what that might look like in the coming quarters as you digest Hypercom? And I guess what point could we see margins I guess Hypercom margins actually start to cross over 40%.
Yes they're going to be obviously sequentially down for a couple of quarters at least.
But we're -- it's been a job one over here across what 50 different managers' MBOs.
I think correcting the supply chain discount disadvantages that their products have will take us 2 or 3 quarters correcting some of the market pricing errors and symmetries et cetera will take a little longer than that.
We want to be respectful to all of our clients and show increased value when we have price changes.
But I think you should see VeriFone-like margins across the Hypercom solution set by the end of 2012.
I will say there's a slight higher mix in Hypercom of traditional services versus higher end software services which have a naturally lower margin.
But we're looking to either rationalize or improve those margins as well.
In the near term down I don't know how many hundreds of basis points on average.
But Bob can help you I guess...
Well I don't want to give specific guidance on the gross margin.
We're pretty confident about where we could come out on the revenue and the earnings per share but we're still working out between some of the cost reductions where exactly on the income statement they'll fall with our accounting which is as you can imagine slightly different from any company that we buy because there are always variances there.
So I don't want to start talking about a particular gross margin.
But we are right out of the box identifying components that we can buy more cheaply than they can so we're switching there as quickly as we can and efficiencies by just introducing our systems into the services organization.
And there are lots of areas where we have teams of people working and improving various systems just simply because of our scale versus where Hypercom was in the market allows us to move quite rapidly in that area.
So you're seeing some good improvements versus their margins even this quarter but will get better quarter-by-quarter.
So it sounds like things are underway but give it a couple of quarters before we start to see some.
Right.
Last one for me I promise.
Just I guess Doug you made some comments to the press about your appetite to do acquisitions still some of size.
Obviously you guys are digesting Hypercom now.
So maybe can you just clarify that a little bit what was the intent there? Well I think the reporter asked me "With Hypercom are you done making big deals?" And I said "Certainly while we're integrating Hypercom we are." But think of VeriFone as a very value-centric but opportunistic acquirer and we look at small deals all the time and big deals probably no more than one a year.
That's not how the Bloomberg report came out.
But the point is we have a great business with great organic growth.
But when opportunities present themselves we're also not afraid of going after them if the price is right and we can make it work financially.
You don't get to write these articles for these guys.
They do it themselves.
And the next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.
Doug real quickly.
A couple of things that we've highlighted in the past as opportunities for you guys the NFC rollout you touched on that already.
Couple of other things that I wanted to just sort of hear some updated thoughts on regarding the pumps and the opportunity that you have there.
Also some of the secure pump and ERP technology and the kiosk itself.
Can you just touch on those? And are there any change in expectations on those 2 pieces in particular relative to your expectations there? Well the kiosk is an ongoing upgrade opportunity for us.
It was a bit of a bubble in 2010 as the kiosk were subject to the deadline.
But we have a great business there with the vast majority of U.S.
pumps and we have a continuous ongoing business of upgrading and replacing.
In terms of the secure pump opportunity financially and arithmetically it's a much bigger opportunity in whole.
There's hundreds of thousands of pumps versus less than 100 000 gas stations.
There's no mandate yet so there's a lot of evangelizing about why this is a smart thing to do.
We've had to cut our teeth in terms of figuring out financial models for smaller independents that make sense wrap it into our media business.
I remain very optimistic about that.
I think 2012 will be the year of the pump in a lot of ways in VeriFone.
2011 was a -- is continues to be a pilot year and a go-to-market year and we're building a channel.
We're building a distribution network.
We're building repair and overhaul capabilities.
We're learning how to sell advertising.
But if our past track record in introducing new technologies to existing markets is any predictor of the future I think we're going to be very successful here.
Got it.
And just to go back to the Hypercom commentary from your release the expectation that you would still see $350 million in revenues and EPS expectation of $0.20 to $0.25.
Can you just walk us through what does that sort of derive from? Is there strong order growth? Is there a backlog number? What is it specifically that you guys are looking at that gives you the confidence over the next 12 months to still have those financial expectations for the Hypercom contribution? Hypercom to their credit continued to perform for their customers right until the very end.
Their Q2 numbers were -- revenue numbers were strong.
Their Q1 numbers were strong.
And listen if you're a customer buying from Hypercom after a 9-month highly publicized antitrust review and a couple of months of not so friendly overtures from VeriFone it means you really like those products and you really were loyal to that -- to those products.
So we think once -- we're very confident that once we get through the early days of turning over every rock and understanding every customer relationship that those customers once they hear our commitment to those products going forward will buy even more from us.
The $350 million frankly just represents kind of the run rate of the business with some negative revenue synergies that you would expect in a couple of markets less the U.K.
U.S.
and Spain piece.
And we've always from the start said that there would be no U.S.
piece.
The U.S.
-- I mean the U.K.
and Spain drop off was a bit of a surprise at the last moment.
And we've also always said that in some markets where frankly it was just VeriFone and Hypercom where Ingenico might not have been present or relevant that there would be some revenue -- negative revenue synergies or dis-synergies.
So we're confident we'll get this under our wings.
We are already very quickly and then we'll start growing that business by introducing more products and more services and adjusting things where we can.
And the next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Inc.</strong> I appreciate the desire to reserve '12 guidance for the fourth quarter call.
But Doug just taking a step back you've made some qualitative comments about global demand.
If I use $350 million for the Hypercom contribution next year and something less than that right in the fourth quarter what do you  think the right organic revenue growth is for VeriFone in 2012? It's double digits with a 1 in front of it but it's too early to kind of shake out everything because we haven't completed our bottom cup yet.
So it will be lower than that in North America.
It will be higher than that in the emerging markets.
I think we'll show very good growth in Europe despite the macro environment because of a thirst for customers in Europe to have VeriFone as a very credible provider and because of the unique market position that we've developed in certain markets notably the Middle East and in Africa and the U.K.
and Hypercom's very strong presence in Germany and in France.
So is it 11% or 19%? I don't know.
We'll give you a relatively narrower range in the next call.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
That's helpful.
Just trying to get to it anyway.
And then it looks like system gross margin ticked down a little bit here sequentially.
How much of that is mix or is there something else going on? Obviously maybe multi-lane came off a bit versus the channel.
Or is there something else happening? There's nothing -- I'll turn it over to Bob because we've spent some time on this.
There's nothing "going on" here.
Yes there isn't any one particular item.
I mentioned when we announced this result last quarter that gross margin particularly product gross margin is subject to quite a bit of noise.
It will go up and down.
The general trend is up but from quarter-to-quarter you are going to see noise.
And it's just the whole variety of small items tend to be in there and they moved it to this number at this time.
But you'll continue to see improvements over time in that area.
I think the 2 things that come to mind there were a couple of good guys in the Q2 gross margins.
I think Bob mentioned that as -- in fact I think he may have mentioned it on the call.
And certainly this quarter with whatever 40% year-over-year international growth the geographic mix the contribution from some of the lower margin emerging market economies had a mix but had an impact on the consolidated GMs.
But overall we feel very strong about our pricing power and our opportunity to continue to grow gross margins after the impact of the -- the initial impact of the Hypercom stuff.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
And then it looks like DSOs were kind of elevated again this quarter.
I know you'd made some comments last quarter about the disruption from the Japanese earthquake orders being very linear but deliveries being somewhat back-end loaded.
Is there anything that we should be thinking about in terms of DSOs going forward? No I think they were improved a little bit this quarter.
The Japanese stuff is not a headline anymore.
But I can tell you if you talk to anybody in Silicon Valley supply chain managers are still working midnights with their Asian suppliers calling on different components.
But no we feel good about that.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
So we expect that to come down in the future? I mean it's actually at its multiyear average right now.
Bob had performed some weird act of magic by getting it done to the low 50s at one point.
With a business that is 70% international if you look at our historic DSOs 60% to 65% kind of the zip code that we stopped...
And with Hypercom more international obviously  because we picked up no U.S.
business.
That also will be negatively affected.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
All right.
And then one last one if I may.
Any revenue at all from London taxi yet or is that all on the come for '12? We're getting some.
We're live in well over 1 000 taxis.
Were getting some.
You don't really get to a tipping point on adoption.
Adoption is defined as the percentage of fares that go electronic until you get a kind of an expectation by the consumer that he can use it which takes a little while but it also takes a much larger number of installations than we have now.
I mean for instance in New York a consumer confidently gets into a cab without any money in his pocket and then expects to use his credit card.
That took us 1 year 1.5 years to get to.
So we'll get there.
And the next question comes from the line of Robert Dodd with Morgan Keegan.
Inc.</strong> Just looking at the kind of -- talking about your long-term gross margin expectations for Hypercom.
I mean the Hypercom guys had a pretty substantial piece of overhead in their COGS on the systems side $40 million $50 million managing supply chain et cetera.
The difference between their system gross margin and their industrial gross margin they used to call it which was in the mid-40s.
I mean is there any reason to think that you have to keep much of that overhead? Or in the long term should we be looking at gross margins for the combined business once you cleaned that out that are higher than the VeriFone alone gross margins have been over the last couple of quarters here? We don't get to provide $350 million of services and product with no incremental overhead.
I think what has been referred to as overhead is actually the people working in the service organizations to perform that work.
So it's labor cost in those plants.
We will expect to perform more efficiently and with better reporting improved prices to the customers et cetera.
So we're definitely targeting to improve the profitability of the service organizations and so much true overhead the way most people think of it.
Inc.</strong> Okay.
Got it.
On the EMV and NFC side I mean can you give us a little bit of color on what the -- would be the ASP kind of increase for a multilayered Tier 1 merchant who went from a plain or an ordinary in the U.S.
VeriFone terminal that is just maxed right to one that's perhaps got NFC and EMV functionality? Would that be a 20% ASP increase? Or can you give us a ballpark number there? It's still unknown.
For instance the NFC capability itself should raise an ASP by $50 to $100 per system whether it's a standalone plug-in or it's more likely just customers really wanted integrated solution just a higher priced system.
But we're charging and customers are paying for individually for the Google software Wallet for the Isis Wallet.
We're going to be charging for the PayPal wallet and the same goes for EMV.
The cost of the EMV card slot the cost to us might be $20 and the ASP might be $50 increment.
But we're a long way from even seeing what a spec is going to look like from Visa and if Visa's partners at MasterCard follow through as to what the EMV requirements are going to be.
And those requirements are going to lead to software and that software is going to have to be written.
So depending on the complexity of that software it will change the price points of the solution.
So at the end of the day I think there's still a lot of -- at least in the EMV side there's still a lot of mystery as to what Visa would like to accomplish here.
Obviously we're very supportive of everything they do pro-EMV.
But also I'd like to add that we also think there could be an accelerated turnover of the terminals themselves.
So it's not just how much extra you sell a terminal for but you sell a whole new terminal.
Particularly in EMV you can't be an add on to the terminal.
It takes a whole new terminal.
That the exciting part of that for us.
Inc.</strong> Right.
Got it.
Is there going to be any advantage to you guys in the long run of having EMV as a global kind of standard instead of having to maintain a U.S.
product set which is essentially the only non-EMV product? I mean is there any gross margin advantage cost manufacturing and scale benefit that you can get out of that? Obviously this is years in the future before that's fully implemented.
But any color you could give there? We also sell mag stripe [ph] terminals into sub-Saharan Africa and rural India not just the U.S.
But no I don't think so.
I mean we're at such a scale both in the U.S.
and outside of U.S.
that we already get kind of the maximum supply chain efficiencies.
Even where there's EMV there's various versions of EMV and various software updates for different countries it's not as simple as it may seem from the outside.
Many of the European countries have their own EMV overlays and requirements.
So at a physical level yes everybody's converged on the dimensions of a smart card slot.
But at the software level there still remains a lot of differences around the world.
And the next question comes from the line of Gil Luria with Wedbush Securities.
Over the last few quarters your cash flow has been very strong.
It's at least matched your earnings and I think you made a lot of comments in the past about the fact that you expect that to continue going forward.
Is that still the case now? Is that part of your expectations going forward that cash flow will continue to match your pro forma earnings? We probably have a couple of quarters of noise here as we pay off all the bankers accountants and lawyers that had their nose to the trough on the Hypercom deal.
And then the integration activities are nontrivial.
Bob mentioned in order to improve gross margins in some of the Hypercom services organizations we're implementing VeriFone systems.
So I think there is a nontrivial amount of kind of integration activity that will go on for the next couple of quarters which probably will have a small dent in cash flow.
And then we're continuing in several markets like pumps and London taxis to finance the razor so we could sell the razor blades.
Again at the margin it probably doesn't impact your statement that we're going to have strong cash flow but it's a bit of a headwind.
And I think getting through the other end of the Hypercom tunnel here through integration our cash flow is going to be extremely impressive and noteworthy.
Great.
And then your petroleum business you've had some ups and downs.
It's a very big item for you.
Can you catch us up on what percentage of revenue it is? And going forward do you expect it to grow a lot more or kind of in line with the rest of the organization? Well now with the new denominator in revenue it's less than 10% of total revenue.
But I would anticipate as it relates to 2012 2013 it will grow faster than the rest of the company for the reasons we've outlined earlier in the call around secured pumps and the like.
Great.
And then final question one of the gross margins gains you're going to get from integrating Hypercom is what you just announced in the last couple of days which is going direct to a lot of customers in Europe.
Will you also at the same time sell through those same distributors or will you move away from selling through those distributors completely and focus only on your direct channel? No we're happy to continue to make our products available to our resellers.
We think they've been great partners and we're happy to do that.
But we don't -- we no longer think it needs to be just their decision as to whether or not some of our advanced services and solutions offerings are made available to their end-user customers.
And in some cases some of these resellers have done a good job reselling our products and even reselling some of the services that they've come up with on their own and others they've done less of a good job and we want to make sure that we don't miss those opportunities.
We know there's a thirsty need out there by customers for things like encryption network management gateway provisioning you name it and we want to make sure that those customers know it's available from VeriFone if you'd like it.
And the next question comes from the line of Tal Simon with Monness Crespi Hardt.
First question I had was on the services gross margin.
Ticked up pretty nicely sequentially.
Just want to know what the main drivers there were? Go ahead Bob.
Again it's various noise elements although the Taxi Media business was up sequentially.
And so that I would say will be the biggest positive factor there.
Although by no means should anyone expect that every quarter things always go in the same direction.
I think at a meta level here we said before that there's a lot of tailwind on our services gross margins because the nature of many of these businesses -- encryption gateway et cetera -- is they have a fixed cost and they have a variable cost.
And the incremental revenue comes in at a nice pickup in margin.
So over time as our services revenue is growing faster than our product revenues we think it will have a -- start to have a meaningful impact on aggregate gross margins as we reach scale or we reach lift with some of these services businesses.
Okay.
Great.
Then I just want to follow-up on the PayPal partnership that you mentioned.
Can you give us a little bit more color on it? I recall after eBay's last call there was some concerns about PayPal has become more of a competitor? I just wanted to...
Not getting too far ahead of our skis here but PayPal and VeriFone have developed a very good working relationship over the last several months.
And they understand the value of our competency and our willingness to help in our ability to help them get their PayPal to the point of sale available at hundreds of thousands if not millions of American merchants very very quickly.
So they're delighted to work with us and we're delighted to work with them.
Okay.
Great.
And then last question I had was on PAYware Mobile.
Can we get maybe an update there? I think last call you talked about distributing it through more partners.
Maybe we could just get some color on the traction you're getting there.
Yes it's certainly the de facto preferred product by the ISO and processing community.
First Data is selling it.
Several of the processors are selling it.
First Data is selling it now through their alliance channel.
So we're picking up merchants every quarter.
We don't go out and publish our daily transaction volume amounts because if we did across the enterprise it would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
But we're pleased with it.
We're still to this point marketing it through traditional channels who go through a merchant qualification process.
We believe that's a process that has done well for us in the past and we'll see how that goes.
Okay.
Great.
And then a follow-up on that one just in terms of Square which you're obviously alluding to in some of the commentary.
Are you seeing any more of them? There's obviously a lot of -- they get a lot of press.
Are you seeing any of the core business impacted by Square in any way? No not at all.
Listen a business that says 60% of their customers are customers that the likes of VeriFone or First Data rejected is an interesting business model.
But we haven't seen any more noise there.
And the final question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.
If we could just come back to the EMV comments from before.
Doug I guess based on your experience with EMV around the world if this initiative from Visa does get traction I guess what's the soonest that perhaps you guys may see uptick in revenue? Are we talking 3 or 4 years out? Probably a little better than that because -- or probably a couple of years better.
Merchants will start to smell the change afoot and then start incorporating that large merchants anyway into their buying behavior before all the Is are dotted and the Ts are crossed at least buying the systems with the physical EMV capability.
But before we get to the software piece which is an important and critical component here there's going to have to be alignment between Visa and other card associations and the card issuers who are going to have to produce these cards.
And this alignment historically in other European countries and throughout Latin America doesn't happen overnight.
And then this alignment then has to turn into specifications which ultimately will turn into software that VeriFone will write.
It's plausible that we could start seeing sales of smart card-equipped systems to the early movers like McDonald's or Wal-Mart or Costco over the next couple of years.
But it's quite unlikely that we would be downloading the most current version of the then blessed EMV software for those systems within 3 years.
And that's just I think just based on what I've seen in European countries.
Okay.
Just one more question I appreciate the response there.
Looking at the foreign exchange benefit for the year can you guys just shed a little bit of light on perhaps what the benefit was for the top line and then finally to the bottom line for foreign exchange? I'm sorry I don't understand the question.
The foreign exchange impact during the quarter.
Yes? What was the benefit to the top line and then finally to the bottom line? No we really don't measure our foreign exchange in terms of the revenue et cetera.
I know some other companies are always apologizing for the revenue would have been this except for exchange rates et cetera [indiscernible].
We just focus on the revenue that we bring we understand exchange rates are moving during the quarter and we work to bring that revenue in.
So when exchange rates are going negative and in a country like the U.K.
for example so the U.S.
dollar is going up and the pound is going down then we're pushing our sales guys to move the prices up to compensate for that.
And I'm sure the reverse happens when it goes the other way.
And in quite a few markets we sell in U.S.
dollars.
So we're really focused on bringing in the revenue and not driving that excluding exchange rates.
Okay.
Everyone thanks for listening.
We're busy at work driving those operating synergies and gross margin expansion.
We'll talk to you next time.
Goodbye.
Thank you for your  participation in today's conference.
This concludes the presentation.
You may now disconnect.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 VeriFone Systems Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Doug Bergeron CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and good afternoon everyone.
We are delighted with the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011.
For the eighth consecutive quarter we posted all-time record results.
Q4 non-GAAP revenues were $416 million a 51% increase over the previous year.
This is also the sixth straight quarter that year-over-year growth rates have exceeded 20% even when you exclude the contribution from the Hypercom business that we acquired in August.
Sequentially we had quarter-to-quarter growth of 9% excluding Hypercom our highest sequential growth rate in many years.
We continue to see the benefits of our new business initiatives as non-GAAP services revenue comprise 22.5% of total revenues in Q4.
We were able to grow cash by $11 million to $595 million despite paying Hypercom transaction and restructuring costs and paying off Hypercom's entire $71 million debt.
Operating cash flow was a near record $53 million.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.53 per share 33% higher than the $0.40 per share results a year ago.
Today I will review our performance by region and follow with comments on some of our strategic activities including an update on the Point acquisition.
Finally I will turn the call over to Bob who will provide a detailed review of the financials and update guidance.
Our international operations led the way in Q4 posting year-over-year growth of 95% including our Hypercom results and 51% excluding Hypercom as well as phenomenal sequential growth of over 19% excluding Hypercom.
Latin American sales were once again at record levels with particular strength in Brazil where we are seeing strong demand for our VX Evolution systems.
We also enjoyed key customer wins in other countries across the region including in Puerto Rico Mexico and Central America.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues grew 60% on a year-over-year basis and 15% sequentially excluding results from our Hypercom acquisition.
In the U.K.
we generated strong revenues in the retail and banking sectors with key wins at Jusins [ph] Farmfoods and Selfridges.
In London we've partnered with Visa to increase installation in adoption rates of in-taxi payment and media systems in London cabs.
And as part of this effort Visa has launched a $4.4 million media campaign on VeriFone Systems to be aired during the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
We have now signed nearly 7 000 taxis to 5-year processing agreements.
We still expect to have 10 000 taxi installed prior to the 2012 Olympics next summer.
We made some great progress in our expansion into Africa with our first orders for VX Evolution systems to be supplied into Nigeria.
This is a project driven by the Central Bank of Nigeria to turn Lagos into an electronic payment society and cut down on a black market currency trading that takes place today.
Projected systems deployments over the next few years will be in the hundreds of thousands.
Finally elsewhere in Europe we generated excellent sequential and year-over-year growth in Russia and in Turkey.
Moving onto Asia we recorded great results in the fourth quarter.
Revenues were up 51% from a year ago and up 5% excluding Hypercom.
Our business in Australia and India remain very strong with 29% sequential growth excluding the impact from Hypercom.
In Australia we completed migration of St.
George Bank Bank SA and Bank of Melbourne's 40 000 point-of-sale terminals to VeriFone's fleet services management systems.
In addition we made delivery to GM Cabs for the first 2 000 VX 680 Evolution mobile solutions in Australia.
In India we continue to see strong demand with wins at HDFC Bank First Data and Venture Infotech.
As we look forward to Q1 FY '12 it is important to note that the Chinese New Year falls on January 23 the earliest since 2004 which will affect sales in greater Asia and shipments from our Asian contract manufacturers to destinations throughout the world.
Now let me move on to North America where sales were down 5% compared to a year ago when many multi-lane and petroleum customers were still purchasing systems to comply with the mid-2010 deadline imposed by the Payment Card Industry or PCI.
Recall that we were required to divest the Hypercom U.S.
business.
We expect one more quarter of difficult U.S.
comparisons due to the PCI deadline.
Recall as well that the year-ago growth rate in North America was 30%.
We expect to return to 8% to 10% growth rates in the U.S.
beginning in Q2.
We had an excellent quarter of advertising and taxi revenue with year-over-year growth of 13%.
We have now secured 10-year 10 new -- I'm sorry we have now secured new 10-year contracts to process card transactions and advertise with several taxi fleets in Las Vegas including Yellow Checker Star a fleet of 900 cabs.
Our Multi-lane Retail business was healthy featuring key wins at several national retail brands including The GAP Dillards GMC and Jos A.
Banks.
The sale to The GAP satisfied their need for an innovative hardware and software solution to support the Google Wallet rollout.
Our petroleum customers continue to sign up for an annual software maintenance on their VeriFone Gemstone systems.
Now 75% of the 65 000 U.S.
gas stations using the sophisticated Gemstone systems have now committed to the program up from 65% last quarter.
We launched the software maintenance offering a year ago.
It has successfully met our expectations thus far and we expect the adoption to continue to spread even further in 2012.
We now believe that this is the appropriate model for many of our complex system solutions sales worldwide.
In Q4 we installed more than double the number of Secure PumpPAY solutions that we installed in Q3.
However for FY '11 total installations in about 5 000 pumps was below our goal set 12 months ago.
In FY '12 we are now expecting to retrofit 10 000 to 15 000 pumps with Secure PumpPAY.
Remember security at the pump is not mandated.
And as we said several times during the year gas stations have been budget constrained due to tough economic conditions.
We responded by offering a wide variety of options for varying levels of monthly payments and shares of advertising revenue through Secure PumpPay media.
Secure PumpPay Media with video and audio functionality was released in August and many gas stations are waiting to see more data on the level of advertising revenues that can be generated.
At the same time advertisers prefer a broad screen count before committing to national campaigns.
We saw the same dynamic in the early days of taxi advertising.
So while the ramp up for Secure PumpPay has been slower than expected we are definitely moving towards the tipping point of a critical mass of installations that will attract robust levels of advertising.
The opportunity represented by hundreds of thousands of pumps in the U.S.
still lies ahead of us and we are focused on delivering these results over the next few years.
Now let me take a few moments to give you an update on our strategic initiatives.
Our end-to-end encryption software for securing card hold data at a merchant is gaining great momentum in the market.
VeriShield Protect has already been recognized as the industry standard and now that payment processors such as First Data have implemented the back end of the solution retailers are signing up and turning it on.
Q4 was the best quarter ever for new signings.
The customer list swelled from 50 to 66 national retailers including notables such as Dick's Sporting Goods Jiffy Lube Beverages and More! Nautica Hibbett Sporting Goods Sterling Jewelers Duty Free America Zales David's Bridal Benetton Group AAA and Kinney Drugs.
VeriShield Protect secured 43 million transactions in the quarter and our per-transaction revenue model is holding up extremely well.
In October the PCI Security Council finally released guidance on point-to-point encryption solutions and requirements endorsing a hardware-on-hardware approach and expanding its PIN transaction security program guidelines to include all payment card acceptance devices including those optimized for mobile devices.
Our combined PAYware Mobile Enterprise VeriShield Protect offering is a great solution that meets these strict hardware-based encryption guidelines.
We believe this will throw a monkey wrench into the business plans of those who have tried to short-circuit payment security requirements with cheap add-on dongles.
We also made great progress in our mobile payment solutions initiative during Q4.
VeriFone was awarded a prestigious SESAME 2011 Award at the card trade show in Paris for our PAYware Mobile Enterprise solution.
As a reminder our PAYware Mobile Enterprise solution is a secure card acceptance solution leveraging iOS Android and Windows Mobile devices that integrates with existing in-store point-of-sale systems and works with all forms of electronic payments including mag stripe Chip and PIN NFC-enabled handsets and contact with cards.
The solution also incorporates VeriShield Protect card data encryptions and a barcode scanner to provide retailers with a secure solution for mobile POS and other applications.
Disney Stores are now rolling out PAYware Mobile Enterprise in the U.S.
and in the U.K.
and another well-known iconic chain with 2 600 U.S.
stores coast-to-coast is now beginning a rollout.
In addition Aurora Fashions will be deploying its fully-integrated solution into their brick-and-mortar stores in the U.K.
to help with queue busting and to offer a better experience to all shoppers.
The solution will be managed through our U.K.-based data center.
While the PAYware Mobile Enterprise device fits around smartphones and tablets such as the iPad we can now provide retailers with the software apps to run in the phones and tablets and serve customers in a consultative passion throughout the store.
We recently completed the acquisition of Global Bay Mobile Technologies a leading provider of next-generation mobile retail solutions.
The integrated VeriFone and Global Bay platform extends beyond payments to offer a complete set of mobile retail applications such as inventory management clienteling CRM and task management.
The platform includes mobile user interface management local data storage the synchronization of data and application updates and integration to many of the most common back-end systems that retailers deploy including Oracle Epicor SAP IBM and many more.
We continue to make great progress on our strategic relationships.
Google is now live in approximately 40 000 VeriFone lanes across the country.
VeriFone has upgraded each of these lanes with NFC functionality and sold the VeriFone Google application and interfaces at each live location.
VeriFone has proven invaluable in the Google Wallet initiative delivering 12 of the 13 of the SingleTap merchants listed on the Google Wallet website.
We also continue to work very closely with AT&amp;T T-Mobile and Verizon's payment joint venture called Isis to support their 2012 pilot plans as well as scaling to support their national rollout.
In addition PayPal is going extremely well as we are actively engaging merchants and collaborating with PayPal in how we can support their 2012 objectives.
We will continue to actively pursue additional partnerships and are pleased to see such companies building upon our secure platform and using it as the secure customer interface that will serve as the point of interaction and commonality that bind all of these exciting initiatives together.
It's a great validation of the value we provide as the space evolves.
VeriFone continues to focus on innovation to remain at the center of the ongoing payments evolution and to redefine the point-of-sale as an intelligent point of interaction combining payment and media.
Now I want to provide a brief update on our M&amp;A activities.
I am very pleased with the dramatic progress we have made in our Hypercom integration activities.
Our sales and marketing integration is complete.
We've made significant progress in improving the Hypercom supply chain and logistics model and of rationalizing R&amp;D investment for a combined company.
We have also driven synergies across the support functions eliminating redundant positions and rolling IT applications into our existing VeriFone Oracle infrastructure.
Total sales to legacy Hypercom customers more than met our expectations and in many cases we have already begun shipping VeriFone products in place of less competitive Hypercom products to many of these accounts.
This is particularly evident with our mobile product portfolio where Hypercom was weak.
Sales of legacy products to legacy Hypercom customers were $69 million less than we had modeled but more than offset by sales of VeriFone products.
In addition we implemented our much more stringent credit policies on Hypercom orders causing some deferral of revenue.
Overall Hypercom was mildly accretive in Q4 as projected and we look to improve those results going forward.
We are solidly on plan to deliver 2012 accretion of $0.20 to $0.25 per share or better.
On November 14 2011 we announced the signing of a definitive agreement with Nordic Capital to acquire Point northern Europe's largest provider of payment and gateway services and solutions for retailers.
The acquisition is expected to close by the end of this month and is subject to customary closing conditions.
Point has built a great business and this acquisition is extremely exciting.
For the past 2 years we have focused on transforming our business to respond to the rapidly evolving needs of customers retailers and payment innovators worldwide.
Our vision is to offer retailers everywhere a managed service to easily accept all existing payment types including the evolving alternative and mobile payment methods being offered by Google and PayPal Groupon Isis Visa MasterCard and American Express.
At the same time we can increasingly offer the new payment entrants easy and accelerated access to our worldwide installation of more than 20 million merchant lanes.
VeriFone intends to extend the Point platform throughout the region and beyond with the aim of creating the world's largest infrastructure for rapid deployment of alternative payments.
We expect the Point acquisition to be immediately accretive to our gross margins operating margins and to EPS beginning in the second half of FY '12.
With the addition of Point services revenue will now exceed 30% of all revenue in Q2 assuming a December 30 close date.
We are on our way towards our goal of creating a services-based solutions business with 50% services revenue by the end of fiscal year 2015.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss in more detail the P&amp;L balance sheet cash flows and guidance.
Thanks Doug.
Before proceeding with the financial review I would like to remind our investors that a succinct spreadsheet of our non-GAAP financials and reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financials is available on our Investor Relations website ir.verifone.com.
I also want to take a couple of minutes to discuss why we produce non-GAAP financials and describe what some of the significant Q4 differences were between our non-GAAP and GAAP results.
Since this quarter our adjustments reduced earnings per share from a GAAP level of $1.84 to $0.53 per share.
The purpose in providing non-GAAP results is to provide a view that represents operating results on a more comparable basis by [ph] historically and when projecting future results by excluding significant income and expense items of a more nonrecurring nature.
Although not that meaningful we're looking at current results for example because of the non-cash balance.
This quarter these bridging items were particularly significant in dollar amount because the Hypercom acquisition closed this quarter and we have a large favorable tax adjustment.
These adjustments include GAAP revenue post-acquisition excluding -- excludes revenue earned from deferred revenue items as of the acquisition date.
For non-GAAP purposes we recognize the deferred revenue when Hypercom would have recognized it according to GAAP.
Number two the amortization of inventory fair value adjustment.
The GAAP cost of net revenues post-acquisition includes additional non-cash cost associated with a fair value step-up in value adjustments on acquired inventory.
For non-GAAP purposes we reflect cost of net revenues based on historical costs.
Number three amortization of intangibles acquired with our acquisitions such as developed technology and customer relationships are excluded for non-GAAP purposes.
The charges recorded to conform the acquired fair value of Hypercom inventory and obligations through our suppliers at the time of acquisition to reflect VeriFone's policy for reserves are also excluded.
Also other one-time charges incurred in connection with our acquisitions such as professional fees termination fees paid to employees and expenses incurred to transition to VeriFone Systems and processes.
And for taxes our non-GAAP tax rate represents a steady tax rate we expect to pay.
Thus we have excluded from our non-GAAP an income tax benefit of $211 million resulting from a valuation allowance release in the U.S.
Based on all current available evidence including our profitability over the last couple and strong forecasted income in the U.S.
we had determined it is appropriate to release the valuation allowance and add the deferred tax asset to the balance sheet.
Now I'd like to discuss revenue in some detail.
I will begin my discussion of results with non-GAAP gross margins.
Gross margins came in at 40% a decline of 2.7 points from the third quarter of fiscal year 2011.
System solutions gross margins were lower by 1.9 points primarily driven by higher charges for excess and obsolete inventory as we realigned products in various markets partly due to the Hypercom acquisition and slightly lower margins on the Hypercom products compared to VeriFone products.
Services gross margins declined by 5.7 points.
The sequential decline in service gross margins reflects the addition of Hypercom service business which is primarily low-margin hardware break/fix support rather than the higher-margin services that we generally offer.
This is an area of the business where we are focused on process improvements to reduce costs going forward.
Compared to the prior quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $17 million to $92 million.
This increase is primarily due to the Hypercom acquisition and a full quarter expense impact of our June 30th acquisition for South Africa payment solution provider Destiny Electronic Commerce.
Non-GAAP other income expense was essentially unchanged in the third quarter at $3 million expense.
Now let's take a look at our cash flow and balance sheet.
Cash increased $11 million in the fourth quarter to reach $595 million a significant increase of $150 million from Q4 fiscal '10.
The primary driver of this quarter's cash increase was VeriFone's $57 million of non-GAAP net income.
Also on the balance sheet inventory balances increased by $34 million with the addition of Hypercom.
$7 million of this increase represents a step-up in inventory value associated with acquisition purchase accounting which we expect will be amortized in Q1 fiscal year 2012.
Days of supply decreased by 11 days and day sales outstanding increased by 3 days to 68 primarily as a result of adding the Hypercom balances.
Now let's look forward to fiscal year 2012.
Our new guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '12 including one month of Point revenue is for non-GAAP revenue to be between $415 million and $420 million.
We now expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.52.
On a full year basis for fiscal '12 our new guidance for non-GAAP revenue including 10 months of Point revenue is in the range of $1 900 000 000 and $1 920 000 000.
We now expect fiscal '12 full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $2.53 to $2.60.
I will now turn it over to Doug Bergeron for some concluding remarks.
Thanks Bob.
Let me just take a few moments to look back at our accomplishments for the full 2011 fiscal year.
Revenues grew 31% to $1.3 billion and excluding the impact of Hypercom grew 24%.
Earnings for the second year in a row grew in excess of 45% rising from $1.32 per share in 2010 to $1.92 per share this year.
And our year-over-year ending cash balance grew $150 million.
We completed a very complicated takeover of Hypercom and then proceeded to rapidly integrate the business and we are already enjoying significant operating synergies.
We expect solid gross margin expansion from this additional business throughout 2012.
Our focus on services is reaping great rewards for our shareholders.
Growth rates have accelerated margins are expanding and we have developed unique advantages for our product portfolio as they are increasingly bundled with encryption services content and advertising gateway services and cloud-based retail application processing.
Looking ahead to 2012 we see a world of opportunity for VeriFone unparalleled in the 10-plus years that I have been CEO.
The amount of innovation at the edge of the network the VeriFone neighborhood has never been greater.
In addition industry developments and new payment entrants continue to create opportunities for VeriFone.
For the first time ever Visa and MasterCard are both strongly hinting of a looming EMV debt mandate for the U.S.
bringing us to European levels of security and point-of-sale complexity.
PayPal Google Isis and others have aggressive plans for their VeriFone partnerships in 2012.
In summary retailers worldwide are looking for ways to adopt this innovation in a consistent secure deliberate way that opens the door to the future but keeps their existing infrastructure always on and always secure.
VeriFone is uniquely positioned to provide both innovation and to protect their existing infrastructure.
Thank you for listening and we will now open up the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions] And gentlemen your first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.
Research Division</strong> The first question is: Would you mind trying to break down for us what the organic growth rate was if you back out Hypercom? For -- I know you said greater than 20% but maybe give us a sense more exact what it was? And then maybe even per region especially in Europe what did the your organic story look like? Well I think we -- if you go through the transcript Darrin we quoted both sequential and year-over-year growth rates almost by region including and excluding Hypercom.
So I think it's in the transcript but yes it was early on.
But it was 20 -- in the low 20s or x Hypercom and higher than that with Hypercom.
I think the amazing story for us continues to be Europe surprisingly given the headline news and in Latin America where our business is accelerating and has experienced phenomenal growth rates before even including the Hypercom business.
You would find every one of those growth numbers.
We spread it between the 2 of them Darrin.
Research Division</strong> All right.
The other question I have is really around the services revenue.
Again it was pretty impressive to grow to about 22.5% of your total revenue this quarter clearly higher than it's been in a number of quarters.
I think in really ever that I've seen.
And I think the question is just Hypercom again is I would think more system solutions revenue in terms of mix.
So is it really just the overall growth rate? What is the underlying -- the main drivers? Is it the taxi business? Can you help us understand how it got so high this quarter? Hypercom was more services.
The brick 6 services which have -- are currently quite dilutive from a gross margin perspective but we're rapidly in the process of improving those with systems and other things.
So we will get Hypercom lower-margin repair services up to VeriFone service gross margin levels or thereabout.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then the last question on encryption you said -- it sound like it's going extremely well.
The -- can you give us a little more color on that again in terms of the economic model there? I think you said you're now at 66 retailers a pretty significant number of large names brand names.
A retailer if you're going to put this in he does it coast-to-coast he doesn't do it at one store.
The revenue model is quite simple.
We either sell directly to the retailer and charge a per-transaction fee or we sell through a processor who charges the retailer a retail per transaction fee and buys from us wholesale per transaction.
In other words marks up the service and makes money on it.
But it's all based on volume.
It's not based on ticket size.
And we've been very good at sticking to our price charts.
So I'm very delighted.
I was -- in the early days of this campaign I was cynical that this could stick but it adds real value it saves retailers real money it removes real risk and it's a real value that people are willing to pay for.
Your next question is from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Just wanted to check real quickly on the drivers in Latin America in particular.
Can you go through those quickly? And I thought you had suggested some of it was coming from Central America but I wanted to just get a sort of a view between South America Brazil and some of the other countries versus the Central America as kind of the drivers in your Latin America growth this quarter? So our Latin America region was nearly -- it was close to $100 million in the quarter I guess.
Typically Brazil has been 50% to 55% of that.
And that's been consistent which is also the case if you try to look at overall Latin American GDP.
And then the other 45% is all over the place from the southern tip of Chile all the way up through the Caribbean and Central America.
But we have a great business in a lot of the Central American countries and in some cases command the majority of all market share there.
The tremendous GDP growth in Brazil looks differently as the business there is strong at the moment.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just want to add on when you look at the number of your terminals that are going in nowadays is the majority of these terminals that are getting installed around the world are they all NFC-enabled Chip and PIN-enabled? Or are we still seeing different iterations of what the kind of the retailers are adopting around the world? Is there any way to sort of decipher between what is already sort of NFC/Chip and PIN-enabled versus maybe not having that full technology yet for mobile? If you want to stick in Latin America or move beyond that? Research Division</strong> Yes I was thinking more globally if you wouldn't mind.
Almost everywhere around the globe but for some areas in India some areas in China and some areas in Africa we've entered a must-have phase for Chip and PIN.
Now there's various different Chip and PIN schemes out there which creates a hugely complex software role for us which is good because it's a barrier of entry.
There's different EMV systems and formats and requirements in different regions even different countries.
And it's very rare that we would sell in all but those exceptions the U.S.
India in some places in China and Africa that we would sell a system that wasn't EMV ready.
Do all the consumers in those countries carry just chip cards? No.
The consumers carry a variety of cards and they're still being typically issued with both mag stripe and Chip and PIN.
But the hope especially amongst European banks is that the U.S.
starts adopting Chip and PIN so they can stop putting mag stripe cards on the back of European-issued cards which is causing a tremendous amount of fraud when these cards are stolen and mag stripe variance are manufactured.
As it relates to NFC there's some countries in the world that have gotten -- in some regions that have gotten very serious.
Australia being one Singapore Turkey I would say 1 out of 2 1 out of 3 of our systems going out the door now are NFC-ready.
They don't have the Wallet but they have the hardware.
We still they haven't implemented anything.
Point it was very aggressive in Scandinavia in getting in front of NFC by providing it to their merchants and I think all of your 2012 deployments of systems for their merchants will have NFC.
And recently I spoke to the CEO of one of the major card processors in Brazil.
And he said "Doug I don't know which wallet's I'm going to be running.
Isn't -- probably this is all not going to be fully shaken out for the next couple of years.
But everything you send me this year we want to pay for NFC capabilities in it.
At least at the hardware level." So I think that we're reaching a point where more and more people are saying "I don't know what the future is for sure but I know NFC is going to be part of it and I don't want to be flat-footed when that day arrives." Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just wanted to get a little granular on the first quarter guidance for a second if I might.
The delta between the pre-announced first quarter guidance and the guidance -- revenue guidance you gave today the midpoint is about $15 million.
In the Point acquisition press release the implication was that Point would generate about $22 million a month in revenue and now it looks like maybe you think at least in the first quarter it's $15 million.
Can you just kind of true that up for me? Yes sure.
Point's revenue grows sequentially every month because of their services model.
So you can't look at the first 12 months and just divide by 12.
It's going to be less than the first month and more in the last month I mean increasing monotonically every month.
This is also the first months of Point in VeriFone and we're being conservative.
We haven't seen their books yet other than what we saw in due diligence and that's the appropriate guidance.
We're sticking by that and by the $260 million of 12-month guidance for the business.
I've been with the CEO of Point all week and he's very confident of the prospects for his business in VeriFone over the next year.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So that implies a pretty steep revenue right? Well the business -- look at the businesses growth rate.
It's quintupled over the last 5 years.
So you interpolate a growth rate out of that you'll see that it does grow pretty fast.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay that's really helpful.
And then Bob could you tell me how much Gemalto revenue had in the quarter? And then similarly how much you think you're going to have in 2012? We're not breaking out Gemalto anymore.
A lot of those products have gotten merged into other products.
We've been switching them out and switching out the customers et cetera.
So Gemalto is very integrated into the rest of the company these days.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Can you remind me when you lap the actual timing you acquired the deal? This month.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay so not much of an impact in '12? All right.
And then the $70 million or roughly $70 million in Hypercom quarterly revenue I understand that any time you do a deal like that it was complicated as you mentioned.
Doug Europe and some of their markets have been volatile.
Is that the right way to think about it in 2012 about $70 million a quarter? Or do you think it gets better as the year roll on? No.
I think you still think it's $350 million.
I think their markets -- they are in some of the more troubled neighborhoods of the world but we're doing very -- we're very well in those markets right now.
Look at our year-over-year and sequential growth in Europe this quarter.
It was -- In the last several quarters it's been very strong.
What we're doing is monetizing the Hypercom customer base.
We're agnostic about which products we sell them.
And it turns out that because of the length of this takeover of almost a year long many of them we found out had already begun writing applications to VeriFone Systems.
So this may churn out even better than we thought.
We'll end up being less dragged down by lower margin less competitive Hypercom products.
We'll have more VX products sold into that base.
And that's -- we're sure we'll get the revenue that we projected as a result of that.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> All right that's helpful.
And then with regard to mobile the number of NFC-enabled lanes is higher than I would've anticipated.
Can you -- And you highlighted PayPal as another driver.
Can you start to quantify what your mobile-related revenue looks like in '12 recognizing that probably there isn't a whole lot if any of transaction revenue related to mobile but it sounds like maybe some hosting revenue and terminal revenue next year? Well yes.
I think the sale of wallets at $10 or $12 a wallet is not going to be meaningful to a $1.9 billion company.
But we're already seeing as illustrated with The Gap sale customers that are upgrading earlier than we had anticipated or raising the ASP of the products that they're purchasing from us.
And the NFC Google Isis and PayPal dialogue that we have with these customers opens the door for us to show them our Global Bay iPad technologies consultative sales solutions.
So I guess that's all mobile too because it doesn't have the cable hanging out of it.
So these dialogues lead to a lot of places and they're going to reflect upon revenue opportunities and a lot of areas of VeriFone's business which might not even be mobile areas.
So customers want to play and they want to be innovative but they don't want to create chaos in their retail infrastructure so they really like the concept of an adult in the room who's helping them innovate quickly but who's holding their hand in making sure that they don't botch something up.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And so one last one for me then I'll jump back in the queue.
When you talk about a return to 8% to 10% domestic organic revenue growth does that contemplate accelerated NFC-related upgrades or is that potential upside? That's potential upside.
I mean in the mix -- at the margin it might have some of it in it but despite what I said about all of these CEOs telling us they're getting ahead of the curve with NFC we don't think in the U.S.
that that's material for 2012.
If Isis has pushed their trials to midyear -- PayPal I'm becoming very impressed with.
I think these guys are going to get very serious.
You're going to see some interesting demos of VeriFone and PayPal at the NRF Show in January in New York.
If that gets a little more traction than some believe that could maybe move the needle.
But no one initiative inside of VeriFone can really move the needle anymore.
We're just too big.
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> I just wanted to ask about the relationship with Google and helping implement the Google Wallet.
What's the fee that you guys get to upgrade those retail lanes for Google's technology Google Wallet? Well we write a bunch of applications to a spec that we jointly negotiate and some interfaces to the application and then we provide that application on a per-lane basis to retailers.
The economics are in the $10 to $12 to $15 per lane.
It's a one-time fee but it gets repaid every time there's a new spec.
And in these early days it's not surprising that these innovators are subsidizing some of these costs through various methods.
We're still getting the money from the retailers but we know of several cases where money is being delivered in the back door.
That's fine -- and I think the thinking is they want to stimulate the early movers in the market.
And at one point -- at some point retailers say "Hey in order to be competitive and do attract type of consumer that I want in my store I better be doing what the guy next door is doing and then it'll just be a cost of doing business.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just switching gears on the Chinese New Year is there a way to quantify the impact in terms of revenue? Just so we can look at it more apples-to-apples for the quarter? It's was about 2%.
We just -- and maybe it won't happen but we thought you know what overall -- China has a new year every year but it's usually in the beginning of a quarter so we can hustle a little further for the next 10 or 11 weeks.
When it's in the last 10 days of the quarter when it is in utter shutdown the situation where you have a different EMV library that you have to load or a cable that was back-ordered or something like that that you just have no time to recover.
So I think we internally said “This is probably $5 million of risk and let's factor that in.” Research Division</strong> Okay good enough.
And then just 2 questions clarification questions maybe for Bob.
On Hypercom I think it was about $69 million in revenue so we can just back that out of the $350 million number and then you get to about -- now you expect about $280 million $281 million in Hypercom revenue for fiscal year '12.
And then secondly I didn't hear if you gave us an actual tax rate to go with for fiscal '12 as well.
Yes with the Point business we said the tax rate would be 18%.
But if we go back to Hypercom the amount you described is correct.
But what Doug had described is that we're still very confident that the $350 million that we have to get that some of it's going to come from selling our own VX products into that same market...
Particularly mobile.
We had a very skinny mobile portfolio and their customers are no less mobile-centric than legacy VeriFone customers.
So frankly we had underestimated that upsell opportunity in our modeling.
And I also think now the customers are getting comfortable with us we're not giving up on Hypercom legacy products.
They're still a very well entrenched especially in places like France and Germany and Southeast Asia and Australia.
And we're very pleased with what we're seeing.
Our first quarter of operation with Hypercom was to go and have rich dialogues with these customers and get them comfortable that we're here to stay we're here to leverage their investment to grow their investment and that VeriFone's their partner.
So we're not jamming product down their throat per se.
And also with the services business becomes -- they're getting pretty merged.
Research Division</strong> Okay I just actually going to sneak in one last one.
Destiny Electronic it’s probably about $4 million a quarter it looks to me.
Is that about right? Yes that's about right.
Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> On the encryption service discussion I think I heard roughly 66 retailers Tier 1 national retailers using the service or that service has been awarded to today.
Can you remind me out of that 66 how many are enabled? How many are using it? We don't have the number on the tip of my tongue.
It's growing quickly.
I mean the long haul which is now not a problem anymore was getting the processors to turn it on.
They have very stiff quality and security requirements.
And particularly First Data who controls such a huge percentage of the Tier 1 Tier 2.
They're now live so like...
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And when did that go live? Was that November 1st? Yes.
I think -- one of the executives that's leading the issue is providing sign language to me.
Yes she says November 1st so must be November 1st.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Is there any major processor that's not using VeriShield? Well there's a small processor called Heartland in New Jersey.
I think they've decided to go their own way.
But I think everybody -- and there's a -- and Fifth Third is not yet but we're making some progress.
And TSYS I believe.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And where do you expect that 66 to go? So one year from now when we're on this call what's a rough number do you think that of Tier 1 national retailers you think you can have? Just ballpark range? It doesn't have to be a specific number.
100 to 150.
I mean I would say the recent acceleration doesn't feel temporary.
So I don't know if there's another level of acceleration.
But even -- if the current velocity that we saw in Q4 continues that will get you to somewhere in the hundreds.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And staying on the same topic of VeriShield is there any way to quantify how many small businesses are utilizing this now? And how many you think will in the future? Well again we were wholly dependent on it getting turned on by First Data and they have now turned it on.
They're educating their sales channel.
In many cases they sell through alliance relationships.
So it's going to take a little while for that education to seep through the whole ecosystem.
But there's no reason -- this is a solution that the processors believe they can make great economics on so they're out pushing it and we love that.
One last thing on VeriShield.
If you've noticed it's become a real differentiator for us in the mobile space too.
We just don't roll out mobile products without encryption.
We don't.
It's almost a religion here.
And in the first wave of mobile payments call it starting a couple years ago I call it the dongle era people cheated the system and there's increasingly been lots of reports of hacking and fraud.
We have stayed true to our mantra that these transactions need to be encrypted before they enter the phone.
And that's -- when you had that discussion with a Tier 1 Tier 2 retailer about their mobile strategy that resonates.
Because these are the same guys that spend $400 000 or $500 000 $1 million a year on PCI audits and worrying about getting hacked.
They're going to do all that and then introduce a bunch of mobile technology that we can show them? We can give them a demo of how to hack into it without -- unless you're using encryption.
The answer is no.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Terrific and I appreciate that color and if I could just slip in one here.
And maybe this is a little bit of a softball question given what you've just discussed.
But I get a lot of questions from investors asking if the point of convergence here is going to be opened up to more software developers.
Is it going to become more competitive rather than closed going forward? And the concept being if there's an iPad type of point-of-sale device won't everyone be able to try and write some type of payment application? If you wouldn't mind commenting on that question or scenario I'd appreciate it.
I think there's 2 things at odds with that.
First of all finally Visa and PCI and others have said there will be rules for mobile payments and for iPads and iPhones using -- and Android devices accepting credit cards and we're finally going to publish them.
So there's going to be a whole area of expertise that VeriFone's going to have an advantage in.
And the second thing and we said this many times at least as it applies to mid and large sized retailers they want to innovate but they will also want to innovate on top of what they already have that's integrated with ERP systems that's integrated with payment networks et cetera.
So the idea that everything gets thrown out is a little bit preposterous.
What we see alternatively is that some of these types of solutions with encryption will be adjunct to the traditional point-of-sale the checkout lane and that's why we're so excited about the Global Bay Mobile Technologies business that we acquired.
Your next question comes from the line of Robert Dodd with Morgan Keegan.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Doug could you give us a bit of color on the current pricing environment? Obviously there are these competitive factors.
You've got normal pricing declines and maybe a couple of percent perhaps in incremental adds from putting mobile modules on terminals increasing the ASP business on the software and hardware side.
And obviously you've also taken out one of your competitors from the market.
So can you give us any color there? Well there's no new entrants and I see Ingenico gross margins expanding because they're a very well-run company and they're concentrating on cash flow and the like.
So I think that speaks for itself.
But this is a technology business.
We'll always be asked to provide more for less but we also have control of costs and areas to squeeze our supply chain and as a result you should expect expanding gross margins over the quarters and years ahead.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Great.
Just kind of expanding that look at the FX issues and I’m aware you price in different currencies by different markets.
But if we go back to the first quarter of '09 which is the last time the dollar had a big move and we've seen a recent fairly significant shift that had an impact on local currency pricing for a lot of your customers.
I mean how is the recent reaction on pricing been from those guys? It's too early to tell.
And also this is dramatic expecting.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> No no.
It's a lot less than that.
We're always down 45% and Mexico was 20% et cetera.
So it's not that much.
But that's within -- for the U.K.
pound when that was declining we put in a price premium.
So that overrode the U.K.
prices to help offset the decline of the pound.
So over – in any one quarter if the shock was big enough we may have to eat it.
But over multiple quarters we adjust our pricing to recognize where our cost base is and also recognizing that Ingenico has some of the cost base.
So it will both company’s prices I think will move some amount.
I mean Ingenico publishes results in euros but they buy components in Southeast Asia and they have developers in India and their cost structure looks very much like ours.
Your next question comes from the line of Phil Stiller with Citigroup.
Research Division</strong> Doug I wanted to follow up on the software upgrade initiative that you talked about earlier.
Just wondering if you can provide an update on how it's -- how the rollout's going in Northern Europe and then perhaps talk about the timeframe for rolling this out more globally.
Yes.
It's going well.
Just like our petro initiative it's engaged us in discussions with each of our customers which in some cases has yielded some immediate responses.
In some cases we're still limiting more bundled recurring rates.
We bought Point which already it was fully into that model.
So I think as our systems get more complex and require more attention from a software maintenance perspective nobody is going to say no to keeping their investment current and compliant.
It's the right thing for the user and it's the right thing for the provider.
Research Division</strong> Okay that's helpful.
Shifting to the London taxi initiative I was wondering if you could comment on what the electronic payment adoption is there relative to what perhaps you saw in the U.S.
at this stage of the rollout? It's slower because in London there was a big bang it was a date certain -- I mean in New York there was a big bang.
There was a date certain that Mayor Bloomberg said "If you want to put that taxi on the road you better -- you have to accept credit cards." And the option of not having the taxi on the road was just not acceptable to anybody.
And then as of that date certain everybody started to see the product and use it.
At 7 000 contracts and 3 000 or so live or a little less than that it's still less than 10% or 15% of all the taxis there.
So the adoption rate is it's in the double digits but it's not anywhere near that 65% that we're at in New York.
But we think as we get more installations on the road and as we get more advertising this Visa advertising is helpful we're wrapping certain cabs with VeriFone and Visa logos now so people will see that this cab accepts credit cards this will inevitably go up.
In general the U.K.
consumer is as prone to use a credit or debit card as an American consumer.
They're both at about the same level for a given transaction.
So it's unreasonable to think that it would be different for taxis than it would be for McDonald's or going into a clothing store.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
Just one last question for Bob.
On the first quarter tax rate is that going to be 18%? Or will it be something higher given that Point will be a month in that quarter? Yes it's around 19%.
Your next question comes from the line of Keith Houston (sic) [Housum] with Northcoast Research.
Is it possible to give any guidance as we look at Point going forward in terms of modeling it in terms of the breakout of the R&amp;D versus sales and marketing and SG&amp;A? We probably won't get into that level of granularity for a $260 million business inside of a $1.9 billion business.
But you can assume that they're pretax operating margins have a 3 handle and are expanding.
And we indicated that our gross margins would be improving over time so I think you really to just rely on that.
We don't give precise numbers in between the revenue and the earnings per share.
The gross margins will be improving and Point will be part of the reason for that.
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's event.
I'd like to turn the conference back over to Doug Bergeron for some closing remarks.
Thanks everyone.
Have a happy holiday and we'll talk to you in the new year.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for your participation in today's conference.
This does conclude our presentation and you may now disconnect.
Have a great day.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 VeriFone Systems Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Derek and I'll be your operator for today.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr.
Doug Reed Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please proceed.
Thank you Derek and welcome everyone to the VeriFone financial results conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.
Today's call is being webcast with both audio and slides available via the link in the Investor Relations area of our website ir.verifone.com and a recording will be available on our website until March 12 2012.

[Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Doug Bergeron CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and good afternoon everyone.
We are delighted with the results of our first quarter of fiscal year 2012.
For the ninth consecutive quarter we posted all-time record results.
Q1 non-GAAP revenues were $425 million a 50% increase over the previous year.
Excluding the impact of all FY'11 and FY '12 acquisitions organic revenue growth was 12%.
Hypercom revenues were $73 million in the first quarter and our major integration activities are now complete.
We continue to see the benefits of our new business initiatives as non-GAAP services revenue comprised 26% of total revenues in Q1 and 23% excluding the contribution from the Point acquisition.
Operating income was over 20% of revenue a milestone achievement.
We anticipate further progress on operating margin expansion towards the end of fiscal year 2012.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings for the first quarter were $0.58 per share 35% higher than the $0.43 per share result a year ago.
Today I will review our performance by region and follow with comments on some of our strategic initiatives including an update on the Point acquisition.
Finally I will turn the call over to Bob who will provide a detailed review of the financials and update guidance.
Our international operations continued to show great strength in Q1 posting year-over-year growth of 96%.
Organic growth excluding all FY '11 and FY '12 acquisitions was 32%.
Latin America had another amazing quarter with over 100% year-over-year revenue growth and 65% growth excluding acquisitions.
We continue to see strong sales across the region with wins at Softek in Puerto Rico Credomatic Central America Credibanco Visa in Colombia and VisaNet in Peru.
We are seeing increasing interest by banks in countries such as Colombia Venezuela and Mexico in creating private label networks to offer prepaid debit cards and credit cards that can utilize our PAYware CMS software and our managed service offerings.
We also are seeing clear signs of market verticalization across the Latin America region as retailers health care providers and government agencies are all looking to implement targeted payment solutions to address their specific needs.
In addition banks and processes are pointing customers directly to VeriFone for help with the complexities of integrated payment solutions in Multi-lane Retail since we are uniquely positioned to provide solutions based on EMV-bank certified software PCI-certified hardware and in combination with our multitude of services offerings.
Our taxi solutions are also generating strong interest in markets like Mexico Argentina Columbia and Brazil where local taxi consortiums are interested in replicating our business models executed here in the U.S.
with our taxi business and PAYMEDIA.
Redecard the second largest processor in Brazil announced in early February that their plans to invest as much as $290 million in new point-of-sale infrastructure during 2012 to gain efficiency and expand their customer base.
This is double the investment Redecard made in 2011 and represents an exciting opportunity for VeriFone.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues grew 102% over Q1 of last year and 20% excluding all of our FY '11 and FY '12 acquisitions.
Revenues from Point were $18 million in Q1 which includes only the month of January.
Due to the nature of the Point revenue model with a heavy emphasis on recurring revenues through their all-in-one offering we expect this monthly revenue to increase sequentially throughout the year.
In the U.K.
we continue to do well in the retail sector with wins at FEXCO Travis Perkins and Post [ph] and Punch Taverns.
NFC and mobile activity is growing in the U.K.
driven primarily by retailers' strong focus on positioning themselves to support contactless cards by the Summer Olympics.
Our PAYware Mobile Enterprise solution offering is generating significant traction in the U.K.
with wins at Adidas Whole Foods and Limited Brands.
As a reminder with PAYware Mobile Enterprise retailers can equip store personnel with smart mobile devices that enable roaming checkout operations so that items can be scanned payment cards accepted and receipts e-mailed to customers or transmitted to a nearby wireless printer all in a PCI-compliant environment.
Absa Bank the largest bank in Africa has now licensed the VeriFone software offering in South Africa and placed their first orders for the VeriFone VX Evolution solutions.
Supplying to this customer during 2012 will be significant it will help drive our services margins in the region.
Speaking to ASA one of the largest retailers in Africa is doing a full estate replacement using our VX product line.
Again this will go hand-in-hand with our extensive software and services solutions.
The Middle East is an expanding market for us with wins this quarter at Al Rajhi and BSF in Saudi Arabia and Bank Mashreq in Kuwait.
We saw year-over-year organic sales growth of 84% in Russia and reached a milestone this quarter with the installation of the millionth VeriFone payment system through INPAS our local partner.
Our London black cab initiative continues to progress very well.
We have now signed over 8 500 cabs and have installed our system to nearly 3 000.
To ramp up installations we are opening a 20 000 square-foot facility in Central London next week.
While we may not reach our original goal of 10 000 installed by the Olympics we are still pushing towards it and expect to come very close.
Moving onto Asia.
We recorded solid results in the first quarter.
Revenues were up 73% from 1 year ago and 3% excluding FY '11 and FY '12 acquisitions.
Remember that this year the lunar new year and holiday week occurred in our Q1 versus last year when it was in our Q2.
As we commented during the earnings call last quarter the holiday week always reduces revenue for Asia but we were able to plan around any supply disruptions.
In China we had key wins at the 2 largest acquirers China UMS with 45% of the point-of-sale systems in China and Agricultural Bank of China one of the top 4 banks.
In addition we made progress on our managed service initiatives winning a 2-year contract with Pullman Hotel to provide a gift card solution.
Demand remains strong in India with key wins at Citibank and Axis Bank.
Elsewhere in the region we had key wins at Narrow [ph] Indonesia and Touch 'n Go and e-pay in Malaysia.
Now let's move onto North America.
Sales were up 4% sequentially but down 7% compared to a year ago.
As I've stated in the previous earnings call Q1 is the last difficult comparison because a year ago many multi-lane and petroleum customers were still purchasing systems during the mid-2010 deadline imposed by PCI.
We expect to return to high single-digit growth rates beginning this quarter.
We had an excellent quarter of advertising and taxi revenue and we continue to expand our market presence signing our first Canadian taxi solution contract for 400 systems in Toronto.
But there have been a few news articles and in fact a lot of hype about our new challenge here in the taxi payment business seeking to run a test in 30 cabs.
As a reminder VeriFone is now in 33 cities with over 17 000 taxi payment and media systems in operations.
We added nearly 4 000 cabs in just the last 12 months.
We've been running for years reliably and securely and we are continually upgrading capabilities to improve the experience for riders so we enthusiastically welcome the New York Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission's encouraging innovation -- encouragement for innovation and they have approved a 30-cab pilot of our new systems including our tablet-based solutions.
VeriFone's state-of-the-art secure interactive media player entertains and informs passengers like never before giving them unrivaled freedom to select engaging content that suits their interest: news comedy sports celebrity features restaurant reviews the ability to play interactive games and much more.
Also with our new systems many riders will enjoy playing the lottery printing location-based coupons or keeping a close eye on trending social media topics.
VeriFone has a successful track record in New York cabs and in many other U.S.
cities and increasingly outside of the U.S.
We're confident that we will continue to build on our success with many exciting innovations.
In December we announced a significant long-term strategic advertising sales agreement with NBC-owned television stations a division of NBC Universal.
This new partnership will deliver audiences across the country access to NBC Universal's award-winning news entertainment and information programming.
This agreement is the perfect strategic fit for us as we extend our payment-enabled media platform beyond taxi TV and into other verticals including our existing client base of over 60 000 gas stations and more than 1 million retail installations.
At launch the collaboration will cover taxis in 9 markets including New York Chicago Boston Las Vegas San Francisco Washington D.C.
and Miami and some gas stations with additional expansion planned.
Our multi-lane retail sales remained strong featuring key wins at several national retail brands including Chico's Pacific Sunwear Finish Line and Petco.
Our North American petroleum revenue remained at Q4 fiscal year '11 levels as we continue to transform from a model focused on one-time hardware sales to a model where software and other services play a much more important role.
Approximately 80% of our stations using the Gemstone systems have now signed up for our annual software maintenance program.
This percentage is up from 75% a quarter ago and is beginning to level off where we expected.
In Q1 almost 50% of our petroleum business revenue came from services.
We retrofitted 1 000 pumps in Q1 with Secure PumpPAY.
Q1 is seasonally slow and we are working several sales opportunities for 3 000 to 5 000 pumps each.
We have received orders for nearly 1 000 other pumps in February.
We are keeping our target of securing 10 000 to 15 000 new pumps in fiscal year '12.
We launched PAYMEDIA Managed Services programs in Q1 and the program is ramping up with more new units sold in Q1 than all of FY '11.
Last week we announced a program to deliver lottery sales in taxis and at the pump.
We are partnering with Link3 which is secure payments processing integration with many of the nation's leading payments and ATM processors creating a nationwide network to securely process lottery transactions in all 44 lottery station states.
The first lottery pilot is scheduled to go live in Pennsylvania this quarter.
On January 30 MasterCard announced the roadmap for the U.S.
adoption of EMV Euro Pay MasterCard and Visa chip embedded cards the payment technology used in most countries and every developed country except the U.S.
MasterCard's roadmap largely mirrors the roadmap announced on August 9 2011 by Visa.
EMV cards will replace the much older and less secure mag stripe cards from the -- in the U.S.
and force not only a reterminalization but also an overall market expansion for VeriFone.
Now neither Visa nor MasterCard are currently mandating that card issuers payment acquirers or merchants move to EMV but MasterCard has echoed Visa's deadline of October 2015 when liability for fraud would shift to a U.S.
retailer who has not deployed EMV systems.
Seeking to promote the use of PIN-based cardholder authentication versus the signature MasterCard has unveiled a liability hierarchy that provides the retailer the highest level of fraud protection only if they deploy PCI-PTS-approved PIN-capable acceptance devices.
In addition both Visa and MasterCard will dangle carrots in front of retailers to encourage them to replace magnetic stripe reading terminals with EMV terminals.
For example both networks would allow retailers to forgo their PCI audits if they have widely deployed EMV terminals.
Now given that an October 2015 deadline is over 3 years away most U.S.
merchants with point-of-sale terminals could upgrade to EMV terminals in the normal course of refreshing their systems given that the average refresh cycle is roughly 5 years.
But that still means that many merchants will be compelled to upgrade faster than normal.
Small and medium-sized merchants who typically take longer to refresh that may not pay close attention to PCI rules and liability risks will need EMV terminals as more and more customers will be carrying EMV cards.
Now there are in excess of 2 million points-of-sale in the U.S.
that accept card payments but don't have customer-facing devices like those sold by VeriFone.
For instance at small and medium-sized stores hotels airlines rental counters pay-at-the-counter food and beverage establishments.
The clerk today simply takes the payers card and swipes it through a mag stripe reader connected to an electronic cash register.
We believe that it is highly likely that those vendors will purchase EMV terminals as front ends to ECRs as in the case in Europe and Canada and other EMV geographies.
In addition there are approximately 400 000 restaurants in the U.S.
with wait staff providing table service.
Similarly they will likely buy pay-at-the-table devices into which diners will insert the chip card and possibly enter a PIN rather than the practice of handing over a card to be taken out of their sight to be run through a terminal or an ECR in the backroom.
In Europe and Canada VeriFone has done very well arming restaurants with EMV devices so that several at a time circulate throughout the restaurant.
So given this new million plus EMV opportunities from pay-at-the-table and 2 million plus EMV opportunities at other merchants that today don't have customer-facing payment devices VeriFone's total U.S.
addressable market should increase by approximately 50% over the next 3 to 4 years.
Now let me take a few moments to give you an update on some of our strategic initiatives.
Our end-to-end encryption software for securing cardholder data at a merchant generated 43% sequential revenue growth as we continue to make great progress with this initiative.
The customer list now stands at 73 and over 45 million transactions were secured by VeriShield Protect in quarter 1.
We made exceptional progress in our mobile payment solutions initiative during Q1 building on our November 1 acquisition of GlobalBay.
Our GlobalBay Mobile point-of-sale and retailing solution allows retailers to service customers wherever they are with engaging content on tablet and smart mobile devices such as the iPod Touch and tie into loyalty systems with in-store experience at the e-commerce systems and take payment from anywhere in the store.
Brighton Collectibles C.
Wonder Stores Guess Coach and Eastern Mountain Sports are all transforming tablets and smartphones into roaming shopper-friendly system that can incorporate point-of-sale shopping assistance online catalogs and on-the-spot inventory management using these solutions.
For every countertop system we can sell 4 to 5x the number of mobile systems because associates carry them throughout the store and these devices need to be docked to recharge.
Even on a one-for-one basis the economics of a mobile solution is much better for us than a recurring -- than a traditional terminal sale because the mobile software deliveries recurring revenue.
We also expanded our mobile offerings with the introduction of PAYware Mobile Enterprise for tablet a comprehensive secure payment acceptance solution compatible with VeriFone's GlobalBay Mobile point-of-sale and retailing solution.
PAYware Mobile Enterprise for tablet provides the same award-winning card acceptance technology used with the iPod Touch and supports end-to-end security with VeriShield Total Protect card data encryption technology.
The solution accepts traditional cards PIN EMV smartcards and NFC smartphone transaction.
Last week we introduced Global Mobile Network Operators to our PAYMEDIA universal acceptance platform at the mobile Congress show in Barcelona.
PAYMEDIA UAP services enables MNOs to easily download NFC wallet acceptance applications directly to merchant point-of-sale systems and allows merchants to collect the app to the provider.
Utilizing the PAYMEDIA infrastructure mobile wallet providers maintain full management capabilities over their application with the ability to update them at any time with new features and services.
Earlier today we announced an agreement with Isis the joint venture between AT&amp;T Mobility T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless to integrate the Isis Mobile Commerce Application in our future and current NFC-enabled product lines.
We've also agreed that our sales marketing implementation teams will collaborate to target large retail and petroleum convenience store merchants in previously announced Isis launch markets of Salt Lake City in Austin.
VeriFone customers will be able to leverage the integration of the mobile online experience to engage consumers with new payment options digital couponing loyalty location-based social media and value added services.
Longer term upon successful expansion of the pilot program to a national rollout we will begin offering the Isis solution to our national customer base using a payment-as-a-service as a delivery model that eliminates the complexity for merchants to not only deploy Isis but also multiple other new services alongside the traditional payment acceptance method.
In addition our work with PayPal and Google continue to go well as we actively engage merchants and collaborate with them both helping them achieve their 2012 objectives.
PayPal's success Isis' success and Google's success means success for VeriFone.
We completed the Point acquisition on December 30 and we are very excited by the transformational opportunities that this acquisition represents.
Our vision continues to be focused on offering retailers everywhere a managed service to easily accept all payment types including the evolving alternative mobile payment methods being offered by Google PayPal Groupon Isis Visa MasterCard and American express.
At the same time we can increasingly offer the new payment entrants easy and accelerated access to our worldwide installation of more than 20 million merchant lanes.
VeriFone intends to extend the Point platform throughout the region and beyond with the aim of creating the world's largest infrastructure for the rapid deployment of alternative payment.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss in more detail the P&amp;L balance sheet cash flows and guidance.
Thanks Doug.
Before proceeding with the financial review I would like to remind our investors that a specific spreadsheet of our non-GAAP financials and reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financials is available on our Investor Relations website ir.verifone.com.
I want to call out one particular item in that spreadsheet unique to our Q1 results.
An FX loss of 21 million from hedging the expected EUR 717 million purchase price of Point was excluded from non-GAAP.
From the signing of the Point acquisition in mid-November to the close of the transaction at the end of December the euro market rate fell from $1.36 to $1.29.
We conservatively accumulated euros over that time buying at a blended rate of $1.32.
Because Point was added to our books at the market exchange rate at the end of December that is $1.29 that rate was compared to the higher rate we paid of $1.32 to determine the FX loss.
The euro is now trading at $1.32.
As Doug discussed revenue in some detail I will begin my discussion with our results with non-GAAP gross margins.
Gross margins came in at 43% an increase of 3 points from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011.
System solution gross margins improved by 2.9 points primarily driven by lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory compared to Q4 and our continuing efforts around cost reductions and supply-chain efficiencies.
Services gross margins improved by 3.4 points.
The sequential improvement in service gross margins reflects the addition of higher-margin Point services revenue and increased advertising revenues.
Compared to the prior quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $3.6 million to $95.3 million.
This increase is primarily due to the Point acquisition.
Non-GAAP other income and expense increased sequentially by $5.5 million primarily due to higher interest expenses as a result of our financing for the Point acquisition.
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet.
Our cash balance at the end of Q1 was $380 million.
I want to point out that there is a further $279 million of restricted cash excluded from this cash balance and included in other current assets on the balance sheet.
This cash has been set aside to repay our current convertible notes coming due in June 2012.
Also on the balance sheet inventory balances increased by $27.1 million primarily due to $25 million as a result of Point acquisition.
Days of supply at 58 days increased by 5 days but it's 2 days less than a year ago.
Of accounts receivable day sales outstanding was down 1 day at 67 days.
I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing our capital structure.
To finance the Point acquisition and refinance existing debt we executed a credit agreement for $1.5 billion led by JPMorgan Bank of America Wells Fargo Barclays Capital and Royal Bank of Canada.
The facility provides VeriFone with long-term debt capital at economical interest rates.
The debt consists of 5-year term A loans for $918 million; a 5-year revolving line of credit for $350 million; and 7-year term B loans for $232 million.
The company's previously arranged credit facility has been repaid in full excluding the convertible notes mentioned earlier.
At the end of Q1 the outstanding amount of the new debt was $1.36 billion.
Now let's look forward to fiscal year 2012.
Our new guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '12 is for non-GAAP revenue to be between $465 million and $470 million.
We now expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.60.
On a full year basis for fiscal '12 our new guidance for non-GAAP revenue including 10 months of Point revenue is in the range of $1 900 000 000 and $1 925 000 000.
We now expect fiscal '12 full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $2.60 to $2.66.
I will now turn it over to Doug Bergeron for some concluding remarks.
Thanks Bob.
To conclude let me say again that we're very pleased with our first quarter results.
Looking ahead to the balance of 2012 and beyond industry developments and new payment entrants continue to create opportunities for VeriFone to leverage our broad product and services portfolio.
Our ability to bundle encryption services content and advertising gateway services and cloud-based retail application processing is a great competitive advantage.
The MasterCard and Visa announcements to push EMV in the U.S.
create an opportunity that extends beyond just the potential replacement cycle.
The level of complexity that U.S.
merchants must manage at the point-of-sale will grow significantly.
Unlike mag-stripe systems EMV systems require regular updates to the EMV kernel brought about by the continuing updates to the EMV compliance specifications.
In Europe and in other parts of the world companies like Point grew out of retailer and acquired demand for ongoing services and support brought about by this complexity.
When contactless and NFC mobile wallet applications are a layered on top of this it becomes essential for merchants to deploy their next-generation systems in a manageable way.
Over time we see an opportunity to wrap our certified EMV products with managed services designed to allow merchants to maintain compliance and still have the broadest access to the new mobile and alternative payment platforms.
Thank you for listening and we will now open up the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will be coming from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Can you start off with the U.S.
business? First of all I know it's sequentially higher.
I know you gave some good color but Doug can you just give a little more disclosure on what you expect to be the major drivers? There are so many different drivers in the business between whether it's software or in the petrol side or encryption or taxi or we can go on and on around GlobalBay and others what was the major driver of the sequential pick up this quarter and what do you expect to be the biggest driver that will turn you to growth beyond just your year-over-year comps getting easier? Yes I mean typically Q1 is seasonally weak for petroleum.
Q4 is usually typically very strong.
The fact is our Q1 was excellent even -- it was equivalent to our Q4 numbers so we're seeing some pickup there not just with Secure PumpPAY but also with our Gemstone family of products.
Multi-lane Retail as we said continues to execute also.
And there's -- I'll tell you this it's GlobalBay tablet-based solution is the real door opener.
We're getting -- we could be demoing that product 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
And we're getting a competitive advantage in our bundled solutions with that and our traditional systems.
Taxi continues to do well.
Our overall taxi business will do well in excess of $100 million this year of taxi processing and advertising still nothing to write home about in the small business space.
We've been planning for that for a couple of years so there are some signs of some improvement there.
But net-net I think we've got a lot of irons in the fire in the U.S.
and I'm expecting a return to good -- some good solid year-over-year organic growth this current quarter and beyond.
Research Division</strong> All right.
Just to hone in for a moment on the GlobalBay side.
I mean as you said there's a lot of buzz around that.
We saw the Retail Federation Conference recently in New York I mean a huge amount of interest from retailers on that product.
Is there something that differentiates GlobalBay's product line on that versus others that will give you edge beyond just your market share? Obviously already with the retailers.
And how big can that business be? It seems like it could be a really good cross-selling opportunity.
Yes that's a great question.
It's not just an application living on a tablet or an iPod.
The business -- the guys at GlobalBay have built that business over several years with unique deep integration to back office inventory systems at the core SAP Oracle and others.
There's a whole list that they can integrate to.
And this proves once again that if both retailers large and small want to work and embrace new technology it has to work with everything else that exists in the organization.
You can't have people walking out of your store without you being debited.
You can't be ordering online from in an aisle unless you know if you've got that product in stock in your warehouse.
That's the first true competitive advantage and we've looked at 10 or 11 of these much smaller businesses and we found they were uniquely positioned that way.
The other thing is our distribution channel; we're the trusted provider to 163 of the top 200 retailers.
When we walk in with the VeriFone name on a new piece of technology people stand up and listen and believe that they're going to be supported by the big VeriFone team.
So we can get a very instantaneous wide access to the whole market coast-to-coast and customers are very confident that these products will be supported and enhanced over time.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
But just in terms of size you gave is this something that can be another taxi business over time? Our expectation this year is 50% or 75% growth which gets them to low double digits.
But I believe -- or at that type of growth rate yes you can easily see a $50 million to $100 million business over several years.
Research Division</strong> That's great.
Just last question for you and I'll jump back in the queue.
On the Asia business we obviously expected a pretty decent sequential drop from Chinese New Year timing although we didn't see that.
I know you mentioned a couple of wins on the call earlier.
Can you give a little more color on that? Is that sustainable this kind of growth? I mean that must have been a very strong quarter in the region to offset the timing on the Chinese holiday? Well we were well aware of the Lunar New year the Chinese New Year so we made sure our people on the ground sold ahead of it.
We've got some great new managers in China and in Australia that we've mentioned in the past and they've now been in those offices for a few months.
And our belief is that we're starting to really get some traction in Asia after -- in my personal opinion some sub performance over the past couple of years.
So I'm very excited.
Several of my Executive Management teams is in Hong Kong this evening or this morning and we're planning a very good year there.
Your next question is coming from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Pardon my voice; I'm a little under the weather.
Doug this is a nice organic revenue growth quarter relative to expectations.
I think a lot of us would have expected the underlying growth rates ramp as the year went on and I appreciate the additional disclosure by the way.
Should this still be 1Q still be the trough organic revenue growth period for the company? Or should we still be thinking about 12% to 13% as North America gets stronger maybe Latin America which had an exceptional quarter really quite strong? Or is there still a ramp to organic revenue growth this year? I think our guidance implies about this type of organic revenue growth throughout the year.
I wouldn't be surprised if some of the things that we acquired in mid-2011 by the end of this year start really flourishing and begin to record those as organic.
I think the mix will shift a little consistent with the premise of your question.
I don't think 65% organic growth in Latin America is sustainable but we'll have good strong plus 20% organic growth there for many years.
And I think you're going to -- we're finally anniversarying out the difficult comps that we experienced in North America.
So for your models Andrew I think 12% 13% 14% organic growth is probably the fair number obviously better earnings growth as a result of increased margins as well.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right.
And with regard to margin services margin picked up nicely this quarter.
You only owned Point for one month.
Is that the right trajectory or in other words should we continue to think about services margin heading higher now that Point will be on the books for 10 more months this year? Yes.
Well it's obvious.
Yes.
Yes exactly.
We're just one month at this time.
We indicated that with Point services we'll be around 30% so we're heading in that direction.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And...
The Point operating margins are well into the 30s so just as a matter of arithmetic blending in 2 months of that will be helpful.
But our advertising is now running at above average margins for other services.
And many of these services I mentioned this in past calls by their very nature have high incremental margins as you grow beyond kind of your first day stuff.
So I think services as a percent of revenue and services margins both are going to be continued highlights of the story over the next couple years.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
One more quickly if I may.
I appreciate the color on the competitive environment the New York taxi which caused maybe disproportionate press.
Could you speak overall to the risk or potential risk that Square poses to VeriFone competitively? I'm recognizing that something like 2/3 of your North American business is petroleum and multi line I'm just wondering how you look at those guys as they evolve and move more toward the brick-and-mortar side of the business.
We've had competitors.
For 30 years we've had lots of competitors that we've taken care of euphemistically over the last 11 years and we will have competitors for the next 20 years.
If VeriFone was to stand flat-footed not embrace new technologies that are out there not engage in great discussions with its customers about where it wants to go we would be yesterday's lunch.
The fact is that's not the VeriFone that our investors expect.
We're as innovative as anyone in Silicon Valley and we leverage that innovation with our incumbency.
The fact around the New York taxi cab solution is we have long-term contracts for -- in the cab advertising on the cab advertising and taxi processing throughout the U.S.
and we embrace it.
I said in my prepared remarks we embrace all types of tests and pilots because we want to be a better company as well.
I don't lose any sleep over this.
And I would further point out Andrew that there's an interesting difference here with what Square is trying to do versus where we're at.
Typically the new entrants into the market is coming with an advertising model or some other thing to take payments and create more value around it and therefore find an advantage versus old-time competitors the incumbents who were just purely in payments space.
Interestingly enough in this case the Square is trying to attack this market where we're already entrenched with a very high advertising value and other values that we're continuing to enhance here.
They're trying to attack it with purely a payment-based approach and so they're clearly getting some PR around it but the economics really lean in our favor.
Your next question is coming from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> I know there's a lot of fun stuff to talk about but I guess I'll ask about EMV and NFC.
Doug I'm curious how does EMV change this whole NFC or alternative payment adoption curve in the U.S.? I mean it sounds like looking at your release you might push some of your payment-as-a-service strategy in conjunction with EMV.
Am I reading that right? Yes.
And frankly I think EMV bends the curve favorably for NFC not to pollute everyone's mind with acronyms here.
But a liability shift whether it's mandated or not incentives for retailers to replace system is a much more compelling motivator than NFC prior to these trials.
My sense is if the PayPal and Isis and Google trials end successfully there'll be satisfactory standalone motivation for retailers to upgrade to NFC as well.
But I think EMV because it will be replacing the vast majority of the U.S.
payment infrastructure serves as an opportunity for NFC to slide in kind of -- without having to move the dial a lot.
And on to your question on service yes I mean what we see in other places that have EMV complexity is that you can't just drop off a mag stripe terminal and replace it 4 years from there.
There's an ongoing requirement for the merchant to be able to manage this fairly sophisticated piece of IT.
So VeriFone using some of the lessons learned from Point is likely to offer many of its customers instead of a product a service that includes the product and also guarantees compliance and turns the lights on for all of these new alternative payment methods.
Research Division</strong> Right.
So just as a follow up you mentioned sort of bending the curve.
Then could we see some more lumpiness then in general because of all this stuff happening all at once and merchants want to -- or acquirers want to reevaluate? I'm just trying to understand how this might influence at least just in U.S.
obviously the buying behavior relative to before if you follow my question? Yes.
I don't know.
I mean what we suggested in the text was that if you look at typical useful -- the useful life of a customer-facing payment device today it's probably 4 years.
For a noncustomer device it's a little longer than that maybe 5 years 5.5 years.
So on average 4.5 years or so.
If the liability shift deadline is October '15 yes maybe you could see 4 years of demand get jammed into 3.
But I think the more meaningful metric that investors still to my mind but we have not grasped onto is that what we've talked about in the paper here and that is the market opportunity for VeriFone in the U.S.
increases by about 50%.
In front of every Micros NCR Fujitsu ECR in every point-of-sale lane in Europe and in Canada is a VeriFone or a competitor's payment terminal.
You can't do that stuff from a cash register.
So about 1/3 of the U.S.
is still in that category be it -- be they restaurants or airline ticket counters et cetera and that's going to be a huge expander for VeriFone more than I think the 4 years and the 3 years phenomenon.
And I'd also point out that unlike when we're upgrading to the PCI 1.3 which was really something driven by the associations and was reviewed by the merchants as a pure cost.
In this case it's the merchants themselves that have already been pushing for EMV because they see that as a very [indiscernible] reduce the fraud costs and thereby their interchange costs.
And so you have people like Wal-Mart who have been pushing this for a while but the retail associations et cetera have all been saying that the U.S.
needs to get to EMV world so that they can reduce their interchange costs.
So I think that you will see faster adoption here than might be the case -- was the case for PCI standards.
Research Division</strong> Okay understood.
I don't want to hog the call.
So just 2 quick ones then I'll jump off.
Latin America how much was Brazil versus non-Brazil meaning non-Yellow Redecard? And the other one was just gross margin.
Did you give any guidance for what it might look like in the current quarter? No we -- well to answer the last one we just give the guidance in terms of the revenue and the EPS and I don't want to jump to make judgments in between.
But with Point being a full quarter versus one month that's a positive for gross margin.
And Doug did mention that margins overall would be increasing through the year.
In terms of Brazil versus the rest of Latin America we don't break out the various countries.
Brazil is clearly driving at a very high clip at the moment but the other Latin American countries are also pretty strong.
Your next question is coming from the line of Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> I wanted to sort of roast the question about the opportunity maybe a little bit differently.
So if we assume that NFC and Chip and PIN and all these things are going to come online is there a way to sort of parse your -- sort of your current installed base between the pieces of hardware that are already installed that would need to be completely upgraded versus the pieces that could use say an antenna upgrade versus the pieces that would just need a software module turned on because maybe they already have the right technology but we haven't seen the modules actually turned on.
Is there any way to think about how each one of those pieces would be -- would sort of have to ramp up in terms of really seeing this stuff translate to revenue for you guys? I think that would be a waste of time.
I mean what I've seen with the NFC rollout is that nobody in his right mind wants a coily cord and an antenna sticking out of his payment terminal.
He wants an integrated device where the NFC capability is integrated with the solution and the NFC wallet is inside operating the software.
And with respect to EMV the -- an insignificant amount of low-single digits of U.S.
payment systems even have a card slot.
And none of them have the EMV kernel for the U.S.
that still has not been specified completely by Visa or MasterCard.
And you can't -- you're not going to attach a coily cord with a smart card reader either.
So when we talk about the reterminalization we mean just that.
These products out there will be replaced by likely EMV-capable NFC-ready replacements.
Research Division</strong> Okay got it.
And then maybe just one last one on the seasonality of gross margins.
Actually I think someone just asked this let me skip that one.
And I guess in terms of the recap on the North America and Asia I think that you are expecting an acceleration in North America starting this quarter.
Is that correct? Yes.
What we've been saying is starting in the second half of 2010 through the first quarter or so of 2011 we were -- we had an unsustainably high organic North American growth rate in some quarters around 30% largely caused by last minute panic buying for the PCI deadline.
So those -- obviously those lumpy numbers were really hard to compare against.
The fact that we've come close is a real tribute to our North American sales execution.
But those numbers -- those anniversary numbers are now behind us.
And we've always said that North America despite the relatively tepid macro environment can be and should be a high single-digit growth market for us complemented of course by our much faster growing international business.
Your next question is coming from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Thanks for the extra disclosures on organic growth.
Just for comparative purposes what was the organic growth in the fourth quarter just so we can get an idea to compare it to the first quarter? We'll have to get back in January on that.
I think it was about the same number wasn't it? If we look at FY '12 guidance.
We don't have it on the tip of our fingers.
I mean I think we didn't appreciate last quarter how hungry some of the sell side analysts were for that so we gave you the code the decoder and the table this quarter.
And hopefully that's helpful for you.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
No I mean it's how we -- just looking at it.
We can go back and calculate it.
I just want to ask about Point.
You guys said it was ahead of plan.
Was it the margins that was ahead of plan or the revenue a little bit ahead of plan? I just want to be sure on that.
I mean it in a more holistic way revenue but only one.
One doesn't mean much.
Margins are slightly ahead of plan but integration well ahead of plan.
Management team is interacting with -- at all levels of VeriFone we're trying to use the term infect a lot of VeriFone with a lot of the great things that are happening at Point and frankly help Point with some of the things that VeriFone has to offer including things like GlobalBay.
And get that GlobalBay product into their channel of 500 000 going to 600 000 merchants.
So overall I'm very pleased with the progress there.
And it wasn't a very complicated integration it's very standalone.
The only complexities were in the U.K.
and fortuitously we've got some great managers both inside of Point and inside of VeriFone who have taken that challenge by the reins and are moving the company forward.
Research Division</strong> It sounds like the revenue of Point will pick up in this second quarter.
Is it -- for the guidance do we know how much Point revenue we should expect for 2Q? We gave you an annual number.
And we said that it will scale almost monotonically through the year because of the nature of the revenue model.
We haven't and probably won't give you quarterly guidance for a business that we just acquired.
But you would expect it to be that January levels times 3 plus some growth so how about that? Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And then just 2 quick ones.
Just there is some confusion you hear different things about EMV Chip and PIN that those terminals are at the same price or higher price than the existing terminal.
Can you just help us understand that? Again we may be providing terminals for free maybe a lot cheaper because the services requirements are going to higher.
In some markets in the world U.K.
Germany they're significant higher than mag stripe terminals than the U.S.
Other markets in the world like Brazil which is a very high volume location I think the prices are not dissimilar to a mag stripe terminal in the U.S.
But generally higher and it kind of differs all over the place.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just the last question.
You mentioned that you thought EMV would drop interchange.
I guess I'm a little surprised to hear that.
Is that something that just that's happened in other markets because I think most banks would still expect to see an interchange even with EMV Chip and PIN? No the argument is EMV has -- lowers the fraud costs.
And it's generally considered that the fraud and particularly the higher fraud cost in the U.S.
are effective but by no means the only factor but just a factor.
And the fact that we have higher interchange rates in the U.S.
versus Europe.
Your next question is from the line of Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities.
Research Division</strong> So it sounds like the Point integration is going well.
How long do you still think you need before you feel it's fully integrated into your business? I would say Point as it is today will be done this quarter but moving payment-as-a-service into other jurisdictions will take much longer and we'll do it as is appropriate and as is a market requirement so integration per se never really ends in that respect.
Research Division</strong> In terms of other restructuring costs that you're going to have to take going forward you've taken about almost $90 million over the last 4 quarters.
How much more are restructuring and then other types of nonrecurring expenses do you expect over the next couple of quarters? We don't give guidance so I can't give you that number.
But the large pieces are already done but there are some continuing integration costs.
For example Point doesn't currently run on Oracle so we need to move that accounting system over to Oracle.
That's going to take several quarters.
And there are a few other things like as we took in Hypercom not an Oracle conversion but other system conversions.
So there will be some expense going forward but nothing like the size that you've seen.
And let me remind everyone Hypercom was a unique acquisition in the sense that we were buying a complete copycat competitor and there were just tremendous opportunities for expense reduction outside of Continental Europe.
And we worked diligently to take those but they don't come for free.
And as Bob stated those are largely behind us a few dangling things.
The synergies and hence the accretion that we had expected from Hypercom are coming in just as we had hoped.
Research Division</strong> So when should we expect the cash flow to catch up with net income? It's been a little depressed for the last couple of quarters compared to pro forma earnings per share.
When should we expect that GAAP to close? Well that's pretty much the same question you just asked so we don't provide the GAAP forecast.
But as I said a large portion of the cash differences now beyond us so the bulk of the difference is between GAAP and non-GAAP will be non-cash difference going forward so I think you'll find those are coming together.
We have a strong multi-year record of operating cash flow.
I look at it our board looks at it do it as a true unvarnished metric of a company's health performance.
So it's -- unfortunately we have restructuring costs related to these acquisitions but they are what they are.
And we're going to get back to where we were plus the synergies and I think it'll be a very impressive story.
Research Division</strong> Sounds good.
And the last question about the U.S.
market have you seen any changes in terms of the competitiveness of the former Hypercom U.S.
business under its new ownership? Are they investing in a new generation of products or is that an opportunity for you to gain share even from your high levels in the U.S.? Yes I have no idea what's going on over there nor do I lose much sleep over it.
I'll tell you we're picking up R&amp;D investment.
I would not want to be a $50 million company trying to compete with us in this arms race because it's not going to be a pretty picture.
I have no idea what they're doing over at Hypercom.
Your next question comes from the line of Philip Stiller from Citi.
Research Division</strong> I just want to go back to the EMV opportunity in the U.S.
MasterCard came out with some different guidelines related to PIN as what Visa had said previously.
Does the presence of PIN matter to you guys at all in terms of making some of these opportunities more or less likely to just pay-at-the-table? Yes I guess at the margin we would prefer PIN.
But by the way PIN is required for PayPal's solution as well so PIN debit continues to -- x EMV continues to be a very popular payment methodology for consumers.
So I think everybody can safely say PIN is here to stay.
But a few boundary conditions like restaurants I guess if you didn't have a PIN entry then you might be silly to still give away your EMV card and let it go into the kitchen.
I wouldn't personally but I think MasterCard's announcement that rewards those who invest the most i.e.
with PIN is going to help carry that forward.
The total dynamics that we see in Europe that the card issue was quite dynamic on pressing the PIN.
They may -- depending on the instruction down to the Chip but -- PIN only to be entered every third or fourth time for example.
But when it's required it's required.
Or the transaction size might be of a certain -- over a certain limit and therefore they request the PIN or they may be requesting they come out every transaction.
So it can be very dynamic and an issuer can even have different rules about when they want PIN.
So rather than just being a Visa or MasterCard issuer this can be a card issuer item that they can be driving.
So I believe that most retailers will arm themselves with the ability to take the PIN.
Yes I mean for instance a store like I still see in -- a European coming in with a card that was issued by a card issuer who is PIN-centric and they're going to want to be able to accept that entry.
I'm just reflecting throughout Europe countries like Turkey are not -- they're EMV signature in countries like the U.K.
or EMV Chip-and-PIN actually are businesses thriving in both countries and I can't even discern which is better or worse.
So I guess the answer is we're relatively indifferent.
Research Division</strong> While the uncertainty remains do you think that could potentially impact buying patterns in the near term? No.
I mean I think that people still need a PIN-entry device because PIN isn't going away.
PIN debit is a very popular modality with consumers.
A large retailer today who is contemplating upgrading their systems is going to minimally require EMV-capable card slots probably defer the requirement for the software and the service because they don't know what their rules are going to be but certainly it's not going to make a decision not to accept PIN-debit with all the reasons why consumers continue to want to enter PINs.
And all of the new alternative payment schemes some of which are very PIN-centric.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then as we think about this opportunity longer term and you deploying a Point-like business model in the U.S.
how should we think about what your annual revenue opportunity is on a per-lane basis? I mean isn't that a good metric to look at? How much revenue does Point generate per lane in Northern Europe versus how much you're generating now in the U.S.? It is although I wouldn't -- I think it's too early to start extrapolating that.
I also think there'll be certain very large retailers who have very large IT departments who have people on helpdesk 24/7 who might be able to go hire 5 or 6 security people and might still want to buy solutions from us with de minimis services requirements.
But -- so we don't know where that line of demarcation is going to fit but for average retailers the complexity of all that's happening in payment we think begets an opportunity for a services provider like ourselves to add real value for them and clear some headaches off their to-do list.
Your next question is coming from the line of John Williams from UBS.
Research Division</strong> Real quickly on the opportunity in Brazil.
I know you talked a little bit about it earlier Doug but I was just curious.
In terms of the competitive environment when you think about the acquirers there it's certainly a different dynamic than up here in the U.S.
do you get a sense that they will be essentially ordering all they needed terminals and not really need more down the road or do you think it's going to be more gradual process over the next few years? I'm sure there'll be -- there's some lumpiness but I just had dinner tonight with the CEO of Redecard who is visiting and they anticipate many many years of market expansion.
You go up to states like Bahia and card acceptance is very scattered.
The number of places in Brazil that are equipped with state-of-the-art technologies still has lots of runway.
So I don't know when that flattens out.
The Brazilian economy is doing very well and as I've stated before it's one of those consumer cultures that not only has high GDP growth maybe it's down to 4% or 5% right now but they have a consumer-friendly young population that likes to shop.
So he certainly wasn't signaling any type of imminent slowdown and certainly we are not either.
Research Division</strong> And the dynamics in your relation I guess between -- relationship between VeriFone and Redecard do you expect that'll change at all if the transaction that they've talked about takes place and they're no longer public? No I don't.
I think they'll have a different type of governance framework but I think that I'm not -- I can't speak for them but I think their new owners who are the minority owners currently want a company that's innovative and can grow fast and compete vigorously and those are the types of attributes that typically most people want to have a very friendly strategic relationship with us.
So based on what I've seen on valuations they're paying up for this asset.
And I think they're going to require -- they're going to want some good returns and the returns are going to come from growth and from market agility and competitiveness.
Research Division</strong> It's still mostly wireless right? That's the big transition from the -- if they don't have a terminal they go right to a wireless versus going to something that's plugged in? I think our Brazilian sales of wireless are around 50% which is probably twice the percentage in other places.
But it's -- I don't -- I wouldn't say it's mostly wireless.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
One other question systems we initiated last week.
A lot of questions have come in around what EMV and Chip and PIN in the U.S.
would look like.
Would it be Chip and PIN? Chip and signature? I guess what I'd like to get a little bit more color from you guys on is the dynamic for one versus the other.
In other words if it's Chip and PIN or Chip and signature does that affect the decision process? I mean it seems that would be a different decision for the retailers but do you think that that changes the need for PIN pad or for a new terminal generally depending on what we see EMV look like here in the U.S.
whatever form that takes? No.
I mean that it's very similar to the previous question.
You're going to need a chip-capable payment device that's secure that's PCI in front of an ECR whether you take a PIN or you don't.
Given that consumers have demonstrated since the late '90s that many of them love PIN and that's continuing and the growth in PIN debit is continuing and that many of these alternative payment programs that the likes of PayPal and others are rolling out have a PIN option I think it's highly unlikely that even if the financial motivation for Chip and PIN versus chip and signature turn out to be indiscernible that major retailers would undergo this upgrade without PIN capabilities.
But even if they did theoretically I don't think it has any material economic impact to us.
But I'd point out that in the work that the Federal Reserve did recently in changing the debit card and exchange rates they did some really good analysis on the fraud and found that the bulk of fraud of debit cards is related to signature.
And when people use their PIN fraud is very very low.
And that is one of the elements that the retailers are looking at and saying and in fact commenting after VISA announcements and it was clearly picked up by MasterCard the retailers say "We want PIN because we want to minimize the fraud costs." Research Division</strong> Do you worry at all though that on I guess the next upgrade cycle of merchants are going to have to decide to do either NFC now and Chip and PIN later? Or do you think it'll be any sort of two-step process? Will they have to upgrade their terminals twice? Or do you -- has that come up in the conversations that you've had? Yes.
And we're -- when we're engaged in upgrade discussions the vast majority of discussions are leading towards a double upgrade maybe a onetime upgrade with both incremental capabilities.
It's clear to anybody that was in Barcelona last week that NFC is not a passing phase.
It's here to stay.
It's getting great traction in many markets in the world.
It works -- the handset manufacturers are now getting behind it and even contactless cards requiring NFC are going to be very commonly used this summer in London at the Olympics.
So NFC is here to stay.
EMV is on its way and I'm very confident retailers won't be dragged through an upgrade cycle twice.
They're going to do it all at once.
Your next question is coming from the line of Wayne Johnson from Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Could you just remind us how many of the VeriShield contracts that you've been awarded over the last several quarters are now enabled and live? And can you just give us an update on how you expect that to track by the end of the year? I don't have the number in front of me.
It's a big percentage and what I was given to read was that we processed 45 million transactions in the quarter.
I think several of the processes are now live a couple are still mired in their own bureaucracy.
But for the most part our contracts now can go live quicker than they ever have because the processors all have our encryption software installed at their hosts.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> So that would imply if I heard correctly and I apologize I have some background noise here that potentially half of that 76 million are now live is that correct? I don't have it with me.
I wouldn't be surprised if it was not more than that but I don't have the number with me.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Well that's good news.
And then same -- similar question on the smaller business side as that is an opt-out service if I recall correctly can you give us a sense on how that's tracking or how that's being viewed from the small business merchant side? I don't have that.
I know it's opt-out at First Data it's really the processors' decision how they want to formulate their contract with the small merchants.
So I'm not aware if everything opt-out outside of the First Data affiliate account.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay fair enough.
And just a quick follow-up.
Can you give us an update on how the new terminals are selling if they've been launched in Germany and Central Europe? I understand that there was going to be a rewrite of some of the programming.
And how has that been received? And included in that also the follow up on their service trailer which I think you had priced at roughly EUR 12 if I recall that's correct.
Yes.
The NRF and I think Darren mentioned you'll see some of our new technology that was introduced in the MX series MX 9 series it's selling like no other new product has ever sold.
With respect to the replacement products to the Hypercom legacy products in Germany we expect the replacement products to be -- they're in beta now and they should be going into full production by the third quarter.
I mean to be candid Hypercom had starved its R&amp;D team for that 8 or 9 months that we were pursuing them.
So when we got the keys to the store we found that they were further behind.
And now we've been putting in a lot of money in that and getting those customers all excited about what we have to show them but it cost us a few months and frankly it was probably the single biggest reason why our out-of-the-gate Hypercom revenue expectations didn't meet our original plans.
But those customers have been kept warm and happy and now these products are close to being shipped.
We expect to sell a lot of them.
Your next question is coming from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research.
I'll try to be brief and this about -- because I think other questions are answered as of before.
But can you shed a little light on I guess the anticipation for the payment-as-a-service in the U.S.
or the EMV? Is it going to be like a hybrid model where you sell the hardware and services or will it be -- like you also sell a combination where you just take out a payment-as-a-service model 100% no hardware associated with it? Yes.
In my experience here and when you go into new extensions to your business you have to be adroit and humble and you have to listen.
You also have to have some view of where you want to go.
So I think it's way too early to be dogmatic just as we've learned a lot and gained a lot from the Google and PayPal and now announced today Isis trials I think we'll know a lot more at the end of those trials than we do at the beginning.
And I think we'll know a lot more about morphing our EMV compliance program into a service 6 or 12 months from now than we do today.
We know it works.
We know retailers like it.
We know they're not -- the vast majority of retailers they're not technologists.
They're all interested in multichannel and getting access to other types of e-commerce capabilities.
And that type of overlay to our customer relationships that currently existed in the U.S.
is best facilitated by that.
So -- but I don't want to act like we know everything here we're going to live and learn.
At this time I'm showing no further questions in the queue.
I would like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Doug Bergeron for any closing remarks.
All right.
Well sorry for keeping you long today.
We've got a lot going on there's a lot of wood in the fire here and we like to be as descriptive with you all about as many things as we can.
So thanks for your patience and we'll talk to you again next quarter.
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference.
We thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Bergeron CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and good afternoon everyone.
We are very pleased with the results of our second quarter fiscal year 2012.
For the 10th consecutive quarter we posted all-time record results.
Q2 non-GAAP revenues were $479 million a 64% increase over the previous year.
Excluding the impact of all acquisitions over the past 12 months organic revenue growth accelerated to 15%.
Hypercom revenues were $81 million up 11% sequentially and 17% over Q4 fiscal year '11.
Point revenues totaled $58 million also ahead of expectations.
Non-GAAP services revenue comprised a record 28% of total revenue in Q2.
Non-GAAP operating income was 21% of revenue for the second quarter in a row.
We hope for further good news on operating margin expansion throughout the remainder of the year.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings for the second quarter were $0.64 per share 39% higher than the $0.46 per share results a year ago.
Today I will review our performance by region and follow with comments on some of our strategic activities including an update on the Point acquisition.
Finally I will turn the call over to Bob who will provide a detailed review of the financials and update guidance.
Our international operation showed continued strength in Q2 posting year-over-year growth of 103%.
Organic growth was 25%.
Latin America had another very impressive quarter with 71% year-over-year revenue growth and 46% growth excluding acquisitions.
We continue to see strong sales in Brazil and across the rest of the region driven by wider acceptance of electronic payments growing economies and a migration towards contact with terminals.
Each and every other Latin American sales region materially exceeded plan with a standout performance in Venezuela Peru Mexico and Chile.
New government mandates kicked off a new wave of growth in some markets.
In Puerto Rico for example the government has developed an incentive for electronic payment instead of cash by rewarding the customer with a lotto number on their receipt making them eligible for prizes if payment is made using electronic media.
The sales tax information is uploaded to the taxing authority as the transaction is processed.
We are hearing that similar programs are now in the works in several emerging market regions where increased tax collection and tax enforcement will be the key to financial stability.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues grew 119% over Q2 last year and 10% organically.
As I mentioned earlier revenues from Point were $58 million in Q2.
The development of the payment-as-a-service all in one model across Point's home markets continues to be very successful.
All-in-one revenue was up over 25% on a year-over-year basis.
We are beginning the rollout of Point's payment-as-a-service offering beyond Point's traditional markets.
In the quarter we kicked off Point business plan expansion in Germany the Netherlands Poland and Australia.
Through Point's gateway we can deliver real-time EMV application support and guaranteed compliance end-to-end encryption and beginning this quarter an extensive merchant analytics capability enabling customers to do daily tracking of their sales and settlements.
Point also confirmed their leading position in cross-channel payments in France.
McDonald's has chosen Point's Paybox offering to process card-not-present payments for its preorders service GoMcDo.
With GoMcDo customers can preorder and pay for their favorite menu item simply by clicking on their mobile device or laptop.
This makes it possible to collect their meal at the nearest McDonald's restaurant without having to go and stand at a queue.
Our African business continues to develop well.
We have now deployed in excess of 45 000 devices to aid the Central Bank of Nigeria's program to convert Lagos into an electronic payment society and have another 55 000 devices on order for installation throughout the second half of fiscal year 2012.
We are seeing demand for similar initiatives in other parts of Nigeria and there are ongoing discussions about similar deployments in other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya and Ghana.
Our London black cab initiative continues to ramp up ahead of the Olympics.
We have now signed over 9 000 cabs and have installed our systems in over 4 000 cabs.
Earlier this month we announced an agreement with Sky News to broadcast news bulletin to London's black cabs.
Our VeriFone digital network VNET will deliver Sky's breaking news to passengers as they travel around the capital.
VNET's Taxi TV now spans more than 10 major media markets.
In addition to providing passengers with access to entertainment and news VNET provides advertisers with a unique opportunity to engage directly with their audience through targeted promotions and information reaching affluent business professionals and consumers inside the cab when they are at their most receptive and least distracted.
Moving onto Asia.
We are extremely happy with our results in the second quarter.
Revenues were up 120% from a year ago and 32% organically.
We hope for even better results in Q3.
As a result of a management upgrade in late 2001 we have really begun to see some remarkable progress there.
We saw a strong revenue growth in China.
We're seeing new business generated from ISOs such as China PnR and Alipay and there's opportunity for future growth with more than 100 licensed ISOs now in the market.
Third-party acquirers are starting to invest in and develop their respective local merchant base.
NFC-enabled contactless cards and systems capable of accepting them are a big and growing trend in China.
And we're seeing more demand from various segments of the market.
Our managed services offering continues to grow and we won new deals this quarter with our gift card solution.
In Greater Asia we experienced our first sales in Cambodia Mongolia and Japan as we expanded our presence in the region.
We had a great win at Woolworths in Australia and we see much interest from retailers in our PAYware Mobile Enterprise and Global Bay solutions.
Sales into the financial institutions remain brisk in Q2 with wins at Westpac and Suncorp.
In India we continued strong sales into the financial sector including wins at Axis Bank ICICI Merchant Services American Express India TCBIL and Global Payments India.
Now let me move on in North America.
Sales were up 7% compared to year ago and 8% sequentially.
Organically revenues were about flat compared to a year ago.
But having now fully passed the PCI upgrade cycle anniversary we hope to see double-digit organic growth revenue growth for the remainder of the year in North America.
Our Multi-lane Retail sales remain strong.
Market interest and adoption of our MX900 series is off the charts in the tier-1 retail space with wins at Dick's Sporting Goods Bealls Ascena Retail Group Save Mart and Kroger.
In Q2 we successfully closed 3 payment-as-a-service deals in our North American business as a first step in bringing the Point model to the U.S.
This long-term monthly recurring revenue offering includes the hardware device management security encryption help desk and a bulk of services.
Our North American petroleum revenue was up 13% compared to a year ago.
Shipments of integrated system solutions including our Topaz and Sapphire products were very strong into the reseller channel and into direct accounts.
We saw great wins at Tesoro Valero and Susser Holdings.
We continue to expand our advertising and taxi market presence signing multiple new contracts totaling over 2 100 new vehicles during Q2 including expansions in New Orleans Chicago Las Vegas and New York.
Our secure PumpPAY rollout continues to make good progress.
Once again we saw a record number of secure pump sales.
We've been working with several large petroleum convenience store operators to advance our PAYMEDIA screen base and we remain on target to sign 10 000 to 15 000 new pumps in fiscal year '12.
We are excited by our Q2 acquisition of LIFT Retail.
LIFT develops and markets the LIFT station at network-connected digital marketing hub that integrates with leading point-of-sale systems in the convenience store and petroleum retailing market.
Leveraging an advertiser funded model the LIFT Station personalizes the experience for each shopper by presenting relevant offers with compelling digital ads on a touch screen display while simultaneously engaging cashiers with a friendly sales script to help close the deal.
The solution increases the up-sell conversion rate as much as 40% and total store sales up to 5% for convenience store operations.
Our LIFT Retail offering integrates with all leading retail point-of-sale systems in the convenience store and petroleum segment including our own Ruby SuperSystem and Topaz XL solutions.
We've seen strong interest in the distribution channel at our petro customer event in April.
Now let me take a few moments to give you an update on some of our strategic initiatives.
Earlier this month we introduced our SAIL payment service for small- and medium-size businesses.
SAIL is uniquely compatible both with mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones and traditional payment acceptance devices crucial to higher volume merchants.
Merchants using sale with iOS or Android devices will receive a free mobile app and card reader that securely encrypts card data with each transaction.
Merchants with higher volumes or multiple locations can opt for traditional VeriFone Systems that support emerging standards such as EMV smart card alternative payments and NFC mobile wallets.
Unlike other merchant aggregation solutions all enrolled users are assigned an actual merchant ID which means that merchants with SAIL are able to redeem card brand-based offers that are increasingly popular with consumers.
Other micro-merchant systems available in the market are closed to third-party app developers and with the U.S.
bank and processing community.
SAIL however enables banks technology companies and independent sales organizations to add instant enrollment and activation capabilities to their own payment or marketing solutions.
The platform includes a mobile development kit and a secure gateway with end-to-end encryption real-time merchant fraud screening merchant settlement services and the ability to connect to third-party marketing loyalty and social media tools.
VeriFone's inclusive approach allows for rapid expansion and adoption through our extensive network of processers ISOs and channel partners as well as a rapidly growing list of nonpayment services providers that are expressing interest in our upcoming developer program.
SAIL offers 2 simple pricing models to meet the needs of many business types.
Lower volume businesses can offer a flat 2.7% fee per swiped transaction while those with higher volumes may select a monthly $9.95 subscription with a discounted 1.95% transaction rate that could save hundreds of thousands -- or hundreds and up to thousands of dollars in fees annually over competing services.
VeriShield Protect our end-to-end encryption software to securing cardholder data at a merchant generated 20% sequential revenue growth as we continue to make great progress in this initiative.
The customer list now stands at 85 national retailers and over 71 million transactions were secured by VeriShield Protect in Q2.
This quarter U.S.
transaction volume through our PAYware Connect gateway achieved an annual rate exceeding $10 billion a first for the mobile payments industry.
PAYware Connects rapid U.S.
growth reflects our wide range of offerings to merchants of all sizes.
Small merchants are selecting PAYware Mobile solutions for use with smartphones and tablets in their business.
Large merchants are selecting PAYware for in-the-aisle check out and for solutions that are integrated with other retail systems.
We saw another great quarter of progress with our mobile payment solutions initiative generating a record number of new customer additions including Samsonite New Balance Tory Burch Sonoco Robert Graham Giovanni and North Face among others.
These customers have all joined the ranks of major retail brands that have selected VeriFone's Global Bay Mobile point-of-sale solution.
GlobalBay mPOS makes it possible for retailers to deploy mobile apps to speed up service and transform the customer experience leveraging secure mobile payments online catalogs and streamlined inventory management.
Our efforts with strategic partners such as Isis and Google are ongoing and continue to progress forward.
Most notably this quarter we have solidified an agreement with PayPal that will help expedite retailer adoption of PayPal services and reduce barriers to adoption.
Earlier today at a press conference PayPal announced the next wave of merchants to sign up for implementing PayPal acceptance at their physical retail locations.
We're pleased to report that PayPal is relying on VeriFone to deliver integration services and software licenses to 10 of the 12 tier-1 merchants named today.
We are excited about bringing the PayPal commerce experience to VeriFone's customer base of 80% of the top 200 retailers with more than 1 million high-volume checkout lanes.
Longer term we are working with PayPal on the continued evolution of payments into a broader lens of commerce.
The PayPal pact also validates that multiple commerce technologies can coexist at retailers.
And the focus should not be on cloud versus NFC but on how to unify the customer experience and allow multiple wallets to coexist regardless of who they are and what technologies they use.
Our vision to be focused on offering -- our vision continues to be focused on offering retailers everywhere a managed service to easily accept all existing payment types including the evolving alternative and mobile payment methods being offered by Google PayPal Groupon Isis Visa MasterCard and American Express.
At the same time we can increasingly offer the new payment entrants easy and accelerated access to our worldwide installation of more than 20 million merchant lanes.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss in more detail the P&amp;L balance sheet cash flows and guidance.
Thanks Doug.
As Doug discussed revenue in some detail I will begin my discussion of results with non-GAAP gross margins.
Gross margins came in at 44.6% an increase of 1.7 points from our first quarter.
System solutions gross margin improved by 1.8 points primarily driven by favorable product mix as we increased sales of our higher margin VX Evolution product line and our continued efforts around cost reductions and supply-chain efficiencies.
Services gross margins improved by 1.4 points.
The sequential improvement in services gross margins primarily reflects the addition of a higher margin Point services revenue for a full quarter.
Compared to the prior quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $16.5 million to $111.9 million.
This increase is primarily due to having a full quarter of Point operating expenses and ongoing investments to grow the business.
Non-GAAP other expenses increased sequentially by $6.6 million primarily due to a full quarter of interest expense from our financing of the Point acquisition.
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet.
Our cash balance at the end of Q2 was $361 million.
I want to point out once again that there was $279 million of restricted cash excluded from this cash balance and included in other current assets on the balance sheet.
This cash has been set aside to repay our current convertible notes coming due in June 2012.
Also on the balance sheet inventory balances decreased by $9.3 million and days of supply decreased by 1 day to 57 days.
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was up 1 day to 68 days.
Accounts payable declined $14 million and days payable declined from 56 days to 47 days.
In the second quarter cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $80 million primarily driven by our non-GAAP net income and we repaid $32 million of debt.
Now let's now look forward to the balance of fiscal year 2012.
On a full year basis for our fiscal '12 we are reaffirming our existing guidance for non-GAAP revenue and earnings per share.
We saw strong demand in Q2 and expect demand to continue at a robust level tempered by our concern regarding the potential impact of a declining euro and other currencies when translated in our consolidated U.S.
dollar results.
The recent strength of the U.S.
dollar has taken away the increase we would otherwise have reflected in our guidance.
So our guidance is for non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion and we expect fiscal '12 full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $2.60 to $2.66.
Our guidance for Q3 is for non-GAAP revenues to be between $495 million and $500 million over 60% growth over last year.
We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.70.
I will now turn it over to Doug Bergeron for some concluding remarks.
Thanks Bob.
We are really happy with the results and the outlook that we are able to communicate with you today.
Both the Point and Hypercom integrations are going very smoothly and the major activities are now behind us.
Our ability to bundle encryption services content and advertising gateway services e-commerce capabilities and cloud-based retail application processing is of great competitive advantage and is providing our customers with an abundance of ways for them to reinvent the retail experience for their customers.
Hopefully our accelerating organic growth will put to bed any confusion regarding our organic growth.
Our strategy blends strong organic growth of 10% to 15% with an opportunistic acquisition strategy that leverages our brand and worldwide distribution channel.
We continue to see an opportunity to enjoy greater than 20% emerging markets organic growth and high-single digit organic growth in our developed markets.
And as we have demonstrated in the past we will continue to convert this revenue growth into an even faster growth in earnings per share.
So thank you for listening and we will now open up the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> A couple things.
With regard to organic revenue growth the disclosure is really helpful.
Is it safe to assume as you look forward that as Hypercom and Point anniversary and move from being part of your pro forma growth calculation into your organic revenue growth calculation that you're going to stay in that 10% to 15% range? In other words those 2 businesses grow consistently with the rest of VeriFone's existing business? Yes.
I mean there's nothing fundamentally less growing inside the Hypercom customer base.
What we had in the beginning was some product starvation and a retraining required to do business with VeriFone versus the way the business was done in the past.
So no we're solidly behind our annual 10% to 15% organic growth rate.
I mean even our guidance for Q3 if you look at that compared to our Q2 performance indicates sequential growth of whatever 4% or 5% which I think can be interpolated to -- as another data point to support our near-term and long-term organic growth goals.
And also I'd point out that the product shortfalls in the Hypercom business in Germany are expected to be relieved right about the time that acquisition anniversaries so it gives us more strength just to -- or confidence in the Hypercom business in that period.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I understand the challenges with regard to FX.
Can you speak a little bit to demand conditions in Europe? I mean I think I heard you say Bob that the entirety of the seeming conservative of this -- guidance for the back half is FX-related.
So couple of things how do you separate FX from demand and how would you encourage us to think about it? And then second what is the assumption underlying the dollar-euro relationship that's currently within your guidance? So maybe a little bit of a sensitivity analysis.
Let me take it first and I'll pass it off to Bob.
I mean there's nothing fundamentally changing in our demand.
As we've mentioned before through good fortune our exposure in Europe is largely Northern Europe the Middle East Germany with the Hypercom acquisition now that we have products to sell and in Africa which is doing phenomenally well.
And we have much less exposure to the problem neighborhoods in Southern Europe.
So we continue to see good demand.
We saw a great organic demand in Q2 and the headlines have been as they are now for several months.
This is all related to just a translation issue.
Over time we can reprice our products to -- in fact Ingenico has pretty much the same cost base just as us to reflect changes in FX.
But in the near term we have products in transit and orders to fulfill.
And as the dollar continues to be at current levels that's different than what we had modeled earlier in the year.
Having said all that we're reaffirming our guidance we're just saying that the FX translation impact eats away some of the otherwise upward revisions we would be making the guidance.
Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Bob maybe you can just start off.
Is there a way you can actually quantify what the guidance would have been had it not been for currency? Or under a constant currency environment what would your growth or numbers would have been? Well so the revenue for this quarter probably would have been $5 million to $10 million higher and it will translate into -- we would have been raising estimates by several cents.
Research Division</strong> Okay that's helpful first.
And then just maybe overall Doug the services obviously continues to grow extremely well.
I mean you talked a lot about different initiatives you're making.
But help us understand I mean long term you're saying you should see no reason why 10% to 15% top line growth isn't sustainable.
Clearly if you have services growing the way they are growing right now margins will keep moving in the right direction too leading to EPS I would imagine north of 20% for a while organically that is.
Can you just give us some more specific color.
What are the top 3 services that you see driving that kind of growth right now? And how sustainable is that? Well as payment at the point-of-sale becomes more complex Point has proven and other markets are begging for a services-based point-of-sale solution.
So I think the transformation from -- in many markets from product sales to much more profitable and predictable services sales will be the leading driver.
We're kicking it off in 4 countries now.
We've already signed 3 interesting deals in the U.S.
and my sense is as EMV comes into the U.S.
that will accelerate.
I think the second one would be our advertising business.
We continue to go into new cities in new countries new cities in America.
Advertising is a great business inside of taxis.
And we make a lot of money from it.
And once we reach the tipping point with secure pump sales hopefully at the end of this year with -- just call it 25 000 to 30 000 installations we believe we'll have a sufficient enough platform to start really making some money on media at the pump.
So those are the 2 things that come to mind as things that can move the needle for the company.
The Global Bay business it's very exciting.
I mean it's still small.
It's still in the above $10 million to $15 million revenue range but we're seeing demand in every one of our regions.
We're building out the sales and support infrastructure in Australia in Asia throughout the whole Point channel in Latin America and in many of our submarkets in the U.S.
So I think the mPOS mobile payments initiatives through Global Bay and PAYware Mobile enterprise also will probably be the third leg of an accelerating services story.
Research Division</strong> All right that's helpful.
Just last question for me on the margin side it's been a couple of quarters in a row of expansion now.
I think you said gross is 45% operating margins are over 21% now.
Look with the services growing at these rates and obviously having accretive margins longer term I mean is there any reason that you're operating margin can't reach Point-like margins in the next couple of years? Well Point operates as we've indicated before at plus-30% operating margin so I don't think that's a reasonable number for us to be looking at now but I could see over the next 3 years as certainly creeping towards the mid-20 operating margins not EBITDA margins operating margins so higher than the EBITDA margins.
We're not running away from our unique position as the premier provider of system solutions in the world.
My expectation is though as those become more complex there'll always be average gross margin less than our services business.
So in some ways that provides a bit of governor on the growth.
But as I stated before our long-term operating model going 3 years out is to be 50% services I think we can get with 50% services average gross margin in the high 40s and operating margins in the mid-20s.
And it's just going to be slowly but surely 50 basis points at a time quarter-over-quarter.
You just have to continue to chop the wood.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
If I could just throw one more quick one.
The organic growth 15% that's without any real benefit from EMV right? Well we get benefit from EMV in a lot of countries because there's constantly EMV library updates and software updates and new standards but...
Research Division</strong> That's really a 2013 impact? Yes.
There's not really any U.S.-driven EMV benefit in that.
But that's for 2013 2014.
Our next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> So just to reiterate the targets in terms of the organic growth assumptions had it not been for currency you guys are still comfortable with that 10% to 15%.
Is there anything in the back half of the year demand-wise that you guys are looking out for in Europe or any other parts of the world that could pose any challenges to your organic growth targets? No.
We did all of our country by country reviews this week and everything is as planned.
Just when you add it all up and converted back to U.S.
dollars you get a number that is $10 million or $20 million for the year less than we had hoped which basically forces into a situation where we had to steal from our hope to increase guidance and cover that.
The euro went from 1.38 to 1.30 and we basically swallowed all of that just through accelerating sales and organic growth.
It's now 1.256 and we're just being cautious here.
I don't -- if the trend continues we're going to continue to make pricing revisions but it's hard to react on a one quarter basis to address the issue.
It's a currency translation issue in the short term.
Research Division</strong> Understood.
Is there anyway Bob maybe you can help us with a weighted average look across Europe and maybe Latin America that we can use to start sort of driving a model with little bit of currency assumptions in it just because this is the first time I think after Point that you guys have called this out explicitly.
It will be helpful to get some sense on the weighted average for you there from a revenue mix perspective.
Yes.
I hesitate to formula-ize it.
But Doug has given you ideas of what the revenue was worth just over the last month of currency changes.
And so maybe you can use that as a guidance.
The thing is in some instances we're totally locked into the local currency revenue and for example the Point contracts.
In other instances it's a mixed bag.
We have the opportunity to change prices if the currency stays down because they will fall long enough.
And that is why I hesitate to say that there really is a formula.
That's going to evolve.
And so and every -- as it changes it will give you an idea of what it is.
But I think what Doug gave you that 10 to 20 for the full year based on the last month of exchange rate changes.
That's across the board and everything in U.S.
dollar is probably the best indicator.
It's not really so much a euro issue as it is a dollar issue.
I mean in the last month or so you've seen commodity prices collapse in some cases or at least come down.
And even the currencies of the resource-centric economies that we've priced in local currencies like Australia and Canada Brazil have come in compared to the dollar.
So in cases like Brazil we negotiate contracts in dollars.
But we then have FX exposure while the 2 months or 3 months PO is being delivered.
So we'll fix this stuff over time.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And maybe just on the 3 payments of service deals in North America.
Can you talk a little bit about the sales process for that? Are you selling those through merchant acquirers processors? Or are you selling those directly to the merchants themselves? Just trying to get a sense for what that sales process looks like and who's it's going through.
We're targeting basically 2 markets the tier-2 midsized national retailer who's big enough to have a problem but too small to be able to solve the problem themselves and there's literally thousands of those national retailers out there and EMV I think will be the ultimate problem that they won't be able to solve.
PayPal and other things are kind of opportunistic right now.
And then the second opportunity is to convert midsized ISOs into payment-as-a-service resellers for us in a shared economic model.
And many of them are looking for ways to grow their business and convert or rent a terminal rental business into a technology services business.
And it's a great partnership and we expect to sign more and more of them over time.
Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> This is actually Reggie filling in for Tien-Tsin Huang.
I guess my question and I hate to belabor a point but on the FX exposure I know in the past you guys have talked about pricing your devices in U.S.
dollars and I know obviously with Hypercom the acquisition in Point maybe that mix has changed.
But have you guys talked about or disclosed what percentage of your volume international volume today is U.S.
dollar denominated? And then I guess a follow-up to that would be in the $10 million to $20 million revenue that you guys are talking about is that purely translation? Or is it also having to maybe reprice some of these U.S.
dollar denominated devices lower because the dollar has strengthened? No.
We've seen no impact on competitiveness or demand.
It's -- when the results are done how they convert to U.S.
dollars back in the consolidation.
The bulk of our overseas revenue is designated in the local currency.
But as we said there are many instances where we have in the past and will again change our local currency prices as the U.S.
dollar strengthens for a reasonable period.
That's why it's very difficult for us to get a particular number and why that's a $10 million to $20 million range because it's quite variable.
The only things that are truly fixed are things like the 3-year contract that we have with the Point business and some business like that where it's -- probably you can't change every month.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So just -- so then clear then because I guess I was under the impression that you guys are actually price -- or quoted price is in U.S.
dollars to your customers overseas that's not the case? Well there are some cases if you're selling to somebody in the Middle East for example.
U.S.
dollar is the general Russian currency.
Yes in Russia we use U.S.
dollars.
So there are certain countries where U.S.
dollar is literally the number.
But in the U.K.
in France Germany it's a very local business and so all of the pricing is designated in the local currency.
Research Division</strong> Okay perfect.
And then I guess kind of following along that path on the expense side are there benefits to the strengthening dollar as well? Yes.
I mean we can't cover it all.
But the good news is and especially for services-based businesses most of the expenses are local.
The vast majority of Point's expenses are euro or euro-like.
So we'll get a benefit there.
But at the end of the day we make money.
So revenue minus expenses equals profits and those profits -- those revenues and those profits when translated back into U.S.
dollars will be 3% or 4% less than we have modeled or some of the upside that we had hoped to be able to go get there in a year.
Research Division</strong> Got you.
And if I cold sneak 2 last questions.
And I guess on Point you guys talked about maybe expand into Germany and some other markets.
And I guess my question on that front is who are you competing with or kind of bidding against in those markets? Or are you going in there with a product that's not currently being offered there? And then I guess my second question would be on the PayPal agreement that was announced today.
I mean is there going to be longer-term some type of recurring revenue opportunity there? I'm not sure if you covered that in your prepared remarks or not.
But if you could talk a little bit about what that contract or relationship would look like longer term.
Sure.
Well the agreement with PayPal is very much similar to what we've formed with Isis and Google.
And that is either they pay us or they spiff the retailer to pay us a per lane software fee.
In PayPal's case it doesn't require an NFC upgrade so we don't get the benefits from that.
And these software applets if you will will have to be purchased over time by retailers as PayPal changes the wallet and they drive more value and come up with more bells and whistles.
So yes we do believe it will be recurring.
We intend to make these options on our payment-as-a-services offering but it's very consistent with what you've seen in the past.
It's still not meaningful in terms of our U.S.
revenue numbers but it's certainly symbolic of where we're taking the business.
Research Division</strong> And on Point going into other markets? Yes.
I mean in some cases where -- like the U.S.
where there wasn't EMV there wasn't alternative payments we're not replacing anybody.
We're filling a hole and we're filling a need.
In other markets in Northern Europe there's a smattering of smaller services guys.
They're called different things in different markets.
But the good news is they need products and we sell products.
And what were saying is the real solution here is an integrated product and service.
So we're optimistic in some cases that we can create JVs share revenue leverage their channel leverage our expertise and have everybody win.
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi.
Research Division</strong> I guess I wanted to start with the systems gross margins.
You guys have had a couple quarters here of very good progress.
Was there anything unusual in the quarter? And what can we expect from -- on that front going forward? No.
I think in the prepared remarks Bob mentioned that we're making really good progress in shifting demand to our latest generation product which is the VX Evolution series which is functionally much richer than the previous generation.
And as you would expect for a company like ourselves we're able to produce it at a lower cost so it has a naturally higher gross margin.
And I think the other theme is our huge franchise in the emerging markets in Brazil urban China et cetera is no longer a drag really on gross margins.
Those countries are -- they really shouldn't be called emerging because they've emerged and they've arrived.
They are now starting to consume higher complexity products that drive higher gross margins.
So the mix shift result of that is beneficial and probably something that we can count on going forward.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And then I guess I wanted to follow up on the growth Latin America.
You guys have had 2 extremely good quarters in a row.
Are you guys seeing any signs of slowdown there? There's a new story that Brazil is potentially slowing down but I was wondering if you could provide an update on the demand pipeline there.
I don't think we track quarterly with GDP growth.
I mean Brazil is a perfect example of riding a multiyear wave of a shift from cash to cashless in the country that has a very active central bank that is -- that believes that an electronic payment society is good for banking.
It's good for consumers.
It's good for fraud and good for sales tax collection.
And that's -- those dynamics -- but for an economic catastrophe like we saw in late 2008 early 2009 don't really change and they're not very sensitive to GDP growth.
In fact I made a comment for the first time in this call in my prepared remarks that we're seeing a tremendous amount of new public policy sponsored initiatives around electronic journaling of payment transactions.
And I would not be surprised to see legislation coming out of the Eurozone imposing things like this on some of the economies that have a abysmal record of collecting taxes from their citizenry but providing lots of benefits for the citizens who are paying taxes.
Electronic collection of receipts in economies that are 70% 80% consumer spending is a very very successful way to raise tax revenue.
Research Division</strong> I'm sure that will be helpful.
Just last question for me.
On the few deals that you signed well a Point-like model in the U.S.
I know it's only a few deals and based on those and what you have in the pipeline would you expect economics of those deals both from a revenue and margin perspective to be similar to how Point has operated in Europe? It's too early to tell.
We don't have enough data but that's what we're shooting for.
Right now the water hasn't got hot enough in terms of EMV compliance requirements dual-sided liability agreements between acquirers and merchants.
PayPal Google Isis really haven't hit their tipping points yet.
But we're counting on some or all of that raising the temperature of the set of requirements.
And I think we'll be very successful.
In terms of the final price discovery and -- well it's just too early to really opine on that Phil.
Our next question comes from the line of John Williams with UBS.
Research Division</strong> I had a quick question on the pro forma revenue growth if you could just scale that up as if you would own them throughout the last year.
I was wondering if you can give us that number.
You mean what's the revenue will be if we put the historic numbers into the prior year? Research Division</strong> Yes.
Yes I can do that.
First of all caveat that this is already meshing together both organic revenue and negative impact of the product shortages at Hypercom for example and some other dynamics like that.
So I wouldn't call this organic growth but it's around 9%.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
The other question I have I know you mentioned the 15% what looks like the 15% organic number in the quarter for a non-GAAP net revenue growth.
I'm just wondering if you can give a GAAP equivalent for that number.
Well the thing is that what GAAP requires GAAP actually requires you to do a non-GAAP calculation when you're doing the GAAP.
Like for that 9% that I quoted you for example you have to take the Point revenue where there are contracts already signed and payment already received that you'd normally count them as revenue if you aren't selling the business.
GAAP requires you to take that revenue out.
However when GAAP is asking you to do a year-over-year comparison for that 9% calculation for example GAAP actually requires you to put that revenue back into the historical period.
So you wouldn't take it -- you wouldn't put it back into the historical period take it out of the current period.
So the 15% actually is the right way.
It's an apples-to-apples comparison as is the 9%.
One is taking the acquisitions out of the current quarter and the other is taking -- is putting the acquisitions into the historic quarter.
But they're both apples-to-apples and GAAP actually requires you to do apples-to-apples.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Just to turn to Europe.
I know you gave a little color on that earlier but if you could do an apples-to-apples comps for Europe I guess what I'm interested in is a what you saw in the quarter? And b what you're potential set up for in the next few months? It seems like generally Europe is slowing.
I know you made the distinction between Eastern and Western Europe.
But any color you can give on that would be helpful.
Well euro -- Europe continues to do pretty well.
As we said on a year-to-year basis the product shortage in Germany is the biggest negative.
But light revenue was a -- did very well and we expect that to continue to grow in terms of euros.
I think we had 10% organic revenue growth.
And if you did it on a constant currency basis which we haven't done it would be better than that.
Research Division</strong> But -- so the 10% I guess x the acquisition that's your organic number.
Yes yes.
It's excluding all acquisitions the ones that impacted Europe would have been Point and Hypercom.
But excluding all acquisitions we had 10% organic growth in EMEA which includes Middle East and Africa and that's not doing a constant currency calculation.
That's eating a 10% after eating an erosion of the euro and euro-like currencies.
Research Division</strong> It sounds like just given that the growth rates presumably in a less developed markets should be somewhat higher.
It sounds like you probably are seeing a little bit of a slowdown in the core Europe business generally.
Is that fair? Or is that not fair to say? Listen what we've said and what I said in my prepared remarks is we get confidence when we have our brainstorming sessions around long-term 10% to 15% growth because of 20-plus percent emerging markets growth and high single-digits growth in the developed world.
It turns out that EMEA has some emerging markets in Africa and Middle East and in Russia but a lot of developed markets.
So I don't know what the coefficient of contribution is for each of those -- into the EMEA number.
But certainly it will be consistent with what we've said.
Some emerging markets growth like Africa certainly above 20% and the rest of the Europe in the high-single digits organically and better than that if you look at it in a constant currency basis.
Our next question comes from the line of Gil Luria with Wedbush.
Research Division</strong> You had a very interesting announcement today with PayPal.
PayPal seems to be making a lot of progress in terms of compelling retailers to use their product.
And especially in the U.S.
because of your overwhelming share it seems like you're going to be a very important partner for them.
They announced 15 retailers today.
That's still a fairly small subsegment of your customer base.
At what point do you think that you'll help them achieve a higher level of penetration? When do you think they hit the inflection point in terms of engaging a bigger part of your customer base? Well that's a tough question.
I'm only aware of 12 and I know we're serving 10 of those 12.
I think in many cases the use case has to be proven out with more empirical data.
I think PayPal is in a good position in that.
The proof can be demonstrated economically what percentage of transactions actually go to PayPal what percentage of those become ACH transactions and what's the total impact on your blended interchange rates or cost of processing credit cards.
And if it's meaningful then I believe that retailers will jump on board and we'll see more.
If it's not meaningful and if users don't report a decent experience then they won't report more.
So in one respect it's kind of a barbell.
These things are either going to fall flat on their faces or they're going to catch wildfire and we'll see things like this everywhere.
Obviously it's in our best interest to be very helpful to them bend over backwards because we pray for the wildfire scenario.
That would be a great outcome for VeriFone.
Research Division</strong> Right right.
And then Bob in terms of free cash flow in the quarter is around $13 million.
Adjusted net income about $71 million.
That gap seems to be widening.
At what point do you expect to report free cash flow that's closer to what -- to the adjusted net income that you're reporting? Well it will get closer over time the integration expenses are getting beyond us so that is one of the major numbers in some of that.
Yes over the next few quarters we'll get it back to -- on track so it will be relatively close.
Our next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I was wondering if you could give us an update on VeriShield.
You mentioned you have 85 customers today.
That sounds terrific like you're adding roughly 10 new large retailers a quarter.
And if that trend continues you should be over 100 by the end of the fiscal year which is something that you earmarked earlier in this fiscal year so that sounds terrific.
What I'm trying to figure out is what is the number of enabled retailers with VeriShield today? And where do you expect that number to be by the end of the year? All but the ones that were signed let's say up to 3 months ago are live.
So if that's what you mean by enabled.
But nobody buys this stuff and keeps it in a closet.
So it's all getting live.
There's just a lag sometimes in terms of key injection and getting things loaded.
Some other statistics that you can chew on I think we're processing around 1 billion transactions now on an annual basis.
There are 60 billion transactions in America so we're still at 1.5% of the total opportunity.
Maybe we're at 2% of the VeriFone addressable opportunity so lots of runway ahead of us there.
Of the 11 processors in America 8 have VeriShield now installed.
So retailers are almost processing almost anywhere to now comfortably installed the VeriShield solution and be sure that a processor of choice will be able to decrypt those transactions and the retailer can wash his hand of never having to touch an unencrypted card data and that's a real standard that we've created in the industry.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> That's helpful directionally.
And I'm going to auger in a little bit here so please bear with me.
I'm just trying to get a better idea.
I thought at the end of the last quarter 38 36 retailers were enabled.
So I'm trying to -- what was the -- what is it today? So 36 was enabled 3 months ago.
Should I expect that there's 50 today? Yes I mean 50 55.
I don't have the number off the top of my head.
I mean we're all -- the sales are accelerating so but all but the guys that would have bought them let's say in 2012 should be enabled so we're in that neighborhood.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And then you mentioned -- you called out Japan in the Asia-Pac.
Can you tell us a little bit about that particular market? Historically how much sales have been into that country? And what's causing the demand and the call out on this particular call that's creating the origin of demand from that particular country? It's been -- that's the only market in the world that's been closed to VeriFone and frankly Ingenico for all practical purposes.
I mean we have meaningless sales there and I think our competitor has meaningless sales there.
I don't have the specifics of the deal.
It's not huge but we're starting to invest.
My guess is JCB and some of the Japanese processors are just getting tired of doing all this themselves and they want to join the rest of the world in making use of technology that works everywhere and probably is dramatically cheaper than their homegrown solutions.
So I'm not making any promises on Japan.
It's been a bit of an enigma for us over 32 years and for Ingenico but it's -- we're knocking on the door.
We're getting a few sales here and there.
Hopefully we'll meet some success in the future.
Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.
If I remember correctly the MX solutions will be rolled out a new one here in June.
If that's correct is there generally a buildup or a deferral of current purchases of the I guess those who would be buying that product and wait for the rollout.
And do you expect an uptick with the new terminals coming out? Well the MX900 series as I've said is one of the most well-received new products we've seen in several years.
There is a high demand for it in the backlog that we've built.
We can only deploy these things as fast as we can.
So it's part of the reason we've affirmed double-digit organic growth for the remainder of the year but it's not the only reason.
Encryption media additional taxis are probably just as compelling.
Okay I appreciate that.
And a little more color on the -- and also again I know it's really small.
You only had 3 deals for the payment-as-a-service.
But just trying to understand a little bit better about how that's structured.
So generally will the customers be paying either $10 $15 $20 a month depending on the type of service they're getting? Or is it a flat fee for all services included? How are you envisioning that product being rolled out I guess as it grows? Again it's -- I don't want to give the specifics of these 3 deals because they're early deals and we're tweaking them as we go and as we learn and as we test the pricing and test what's important and what's not important.
The way it works in Europe is there's effectively a gold a platinum and a super platinum offering and each one has more services including 24/7 help desk or network management merchant analytics.
All of them provide the minimum EMV compliant.
That's the one you absolutely need to have.
And then depending on what you're willing to pay or how much other services you need including in the future alternative payments wallet you check the box on the solution that best fits your needs.
And ladies and gentlemen we have no further questions at this time.
I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Bergeron for any closing remarks.
Thank you everyone for listening today.
Hopefully we've answered your questions and we'll talk to you again next quarter.
Bye-bye.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Bergeron CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and good afternoon everyone.
Today I want to address 2 main topics.
First we will explain the dynamics of the third quarter and how our revenue will grow in fiscal '13.
Secondly I want to comment on recent industry news and how it affects VeriFone.
We are very pleased with the results of our third quarter of fiscal year 2013.
For the 11th consecutive quarter we posted all-time record results.
Q3 non-GAAP revenues were $493 million a 56% increase over the previous year.
Excluding the impact of all acquisitions over the past 12 months organic revenue growth accelerated to 16%.
On a constant currency basis organic revenue growth was a very strong 21%.
Non-GAAP services revenue continued to expand and comprised a record 29% of total revenues in Q3.
Non-GAAP gross margins were 45.4% of revenue an all-time high.
Non-GAAP operating margins were 23% of revenue also an all-time high.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings for the second quarter -- I'm sorry for the third quarter were $0.75 per share an increase of 53% over Q3 last year.
Today I will review our performance by region and follow with comments on some of our strategic activities.
Finally I will turn the call over to Bob who will provide a detailed review of the financials and update guidance.
Our international operations continued to show great momentum in Q3 posting year-over-year growth of 82%.
Organic growth was 21%.
On a constant currency basis organic growth was 28%.
Latin America had another impressive quarter with 45% year-over-year revenue growth and 30% growth excluding acquisitions.
On a constant currency basis organic growth was 40%.
We experienced a setback in the last month of the quarter with a fire that completely destroyed our Brazilian staging and repair center.
The impact to the quarter is less than $10 million causing a reduction of services revenue and a major distraction to our sales efforts where all product sales depend upon services commitments.
We have recently moved to a new facility and expect full coverage of our physical losses under our insurance policy.
But we do expect a further impact to revenue in the fourth quarter due to the disruption.
Revenues are expected to return to recent levels in Q1 FY '13 and beyond.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues grew 109% over Q3 last year and 16% organically.
Organic growth was 24% on a constant currency basis.
We won a contract with one of the largest French retailers for a 3-year Wynid Managed Services contract.
In the U.K.
we enjoyed great wins at Halfords Phones 4U and WHSmith.
Our African business is still very strong.
We continued deployment of devices to aid the Central Bank of Nigeria's program to convert Lagos into an electronic payment society.
In South Africa we see many of the retailers now investing in rolling out our VX contactless integrated products and we have also enjoyed significant wins in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
In Germany we are introducing our new H5000 product and expect to see a steady ramp of sales over the next few quarters.
While in France we are still seeing some weakness reflecting Hypercom product deficiencies that will be remedied later in fiscal 2013 with the introduction of VeriFone Systems and new software.
Point revenues were $56 million in Q3.
Other than the impact of FX headwinds to this all European business Point is performing even better than the aggressive growth plan we have established at acquisition.
All-in-one revenues were up 7% sequentially on a constant currency basis.
The all-in-one business which bundles systems and a suite of software and services into a multi-year contract increases overall revenue significantly over the life of a contract but does defer revenue over many quarters rather than generating an immediate benefit.
The deployment of the payment-as-a-service all in one model across Point's home markets continues to be extremely successful.
The installed base of payment-as-a-service solutions has grown 22% compared to a year ago and 12% since the day the acquisition closed.
We recently signed the largest payment-as-a-service deal in Point's history with S Group in Finland.
We will provide a compressive payment-as-a-service offering that includes payment systems software state management maintenance integration security and gateway services.
S Group is one of Nordic's largest retail organizations with more than 1 600 locations and 11 000 lanes primarily in Finland.
The value of this deal should approach $20 million over the life of the contract.
Deployment will begin this year with the majority of systems installed in 2013 and a scheduled completion in 2014.
Our London black cabs initiative continues to ramp up.
We overachieved our goal of having 10 000 cabs signed by the Olympics and have now signed over 10 700 to multi-year contracts.
Our installations have been behind schedule due to the difficulty in getting cabbies to take their cabs off the road.
But we have recently passed the 6 000-cab mark and expect to have over 10 000 installed by the end of this calendar year.
Moving onto Asia.
We are extremely happy with our results in the third quarter.
Revenues were up 72% from a year ago and 13% organically.
Growth was up 16% on a constant currency basis.
We saw strong revenue growth in China.
The ISO market is developing in China with over 100 licensed ISOs and we continued to generate new business with new customers.
In addition sales to banks were strong and we enjoyed good wins at ICBC CCB and UMS.
In greater Asia we enjoyed great wins with the Bank of Madiri in Indonesia and with the largest Malaysian bank Maybank.
We've begun deploying an Electronic Receipt Management solution to the Bank of Ayudhya one of the top 5 Thai banks.
In Australia we are making great progress with our new point business.
We enjoyed a great win with Bank of Queensland for a fully Australian-based Point payment-as-a-service offering.
In India we saw some slowdown in demand due to the Reserve bank of India's directive to reduce and cap the merchant discount rate for debit transactions to a level half of the current average and below the interchange rate set by MasterCard and Visa.
This announcement has caused acquirers to slow down on deployments until further clarity is attained.
Now let me move on to North America.
Sales were up 14% compared to a year ago and 7% sequentially.
Organically revenues were up 9%.
In the third quarter 29% of the units shipped in the U.S.
were EMV enabled and we're seeing an acceleration of interest for EMV-enabled units which we can sell those -- the EMV software later when the U.S.
industry standards are completed and announced.
Our Multi-lane Retail sales remained strong.
The MX900 series continues to be the fastest launching retail product in VeriFone's history with wins at Verizon Wireless Century 21 Sport Chalet North Face and Game Stop during the quarter.
We signed 10 national merchants for our PayPal e-wallet software solution.
In the quarter PayPal purchased over 15 000 VeriFone e-wallet licenses for our deployment to a growing list of our customers.
We expect that this number could exceed 50 000 licenses by the end of this calendar year.
We had a great win in the transportation sector securing a second New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority contract for bus systems and dispatching software this time in the Bronx.
Late last year we won the Staten Island contract.
We expect other Burroughs to follow with RFPs in 2013.
In the hospitality sector we secured our first major lodging contract with Choice Hotels International to provide MX 925 EMV ready systems across their estate.
Choice Hotels franchises 6 200 hotels worldwide including the Clarion Comfort Inn Quality Sleep Inn and Econo Lodge brands.
This is part of the new market opportunity that EMV in the U.S.
brings to us industries where customer-facing technology was not previously required.
We made good traction with our Point USA initiative in the quarter.
We signed full payment-as-a-service deals with L'Oreal Sizzler Steakhouse Little Caesars Pizza and Overland Rentals.
The North American petroleum revenue was up 17% compared to a year ago led by our Gemstone line of high-end kiosk systems.
Topaz and Sapphire sales remained strong as clients upgrade from our traditional industry-leading Ruby product to Topaz our keyboard touchscreen model and we continue to see strong demand for our powerful Sapphire site controller and web server products.
Clients upgrading to Sapphire solutions include Marathon Cisco Alan BP and other major oil brands.
We saw record unit sales of our Smart Fuel Controller systems in Q3.
This product integrates both pump and point-of-sale support into a single unit simplifying installation and maintenance reducing costs and bringing enhanced performance to the fuel island.
85% now of our retail petroleum location are now under contract for our software maintenance and help desk support services.
We continue to see strong interest in our LIFT offering which integrates with all leading retail point-of-sale systems in the convenience store and petroleum segment including our Ruby Super System and Topaz XL systems.
We are currently in pilot in many retail locations and expect some rollout decisions in Q4.
Revenues in our sales to small business sector were up a strong 17% sequentially with sell-in now rebounding to sell-through levels.
As I will explain in more depth towards the end of our presentation we appreciate that investors are concerned with possible erosion of this business to new entrants.
But we believe that our payment processor and ISO partner our support for multiple payment types such as PayPal Isis and Google and our aggressive stance with mobile offering provide the solutions that most retailers need.
Being locked into a closed payment wallet may work for a single coffee house chain's gift card but most retailers understand that plastic card use will be around for decades that they don't want multiple terminals on their counter and want to accept all wallet electronic and otherwise and EMV cards in the future and not to have separate devices for different payment types.
We won Washington D.C.'s competition for all of their 6 500 cabs including driver and passenger tablet displays card payment processing electronic trip reporting safety alert systems and GPS location tracking.
The 5-year contract will be worth $35 million to $45 million or more depending on advertising revenue.
VeriFone will receive a portion of the $0.50 fare surcharge which is assessed in all cab fares regardless of whether the payment method is card or cash.
The addition of the 6 500 D.C.
cabs will increase VeriFone's taxi media footprint by 23% to over 35 000 in the U.S.
alone delivering over 10 billion advertising impressions annually.
VeriFone's superior strength and reputation in taxi systems and substantial advertising sales capabilities won the day.
But unfortunately last Friday a court in Washington put our installations on hold pending a review that has been requested by some of the losing bidders.
We also made good progress in our taxi advertising business increasing year-over-year digital revenues 37% in New York and 110% in other markets.
Now let me take a few moments to give you an update on some of our strategic initiatives.
VeriShield Protect our end-to-end encryption software for securing cardholder data at a merchant added a record number of new merchants in Q3 bringing the total to 105 national merchants.
We now have 9 of the top 11 payment processors supporting our technology solution.
These processors represent 83% of total transactions processed in the United States and they have invested millions of dollars in de-encryption equipment and software focused on VeriFone Systems.
They also act as our sales agents.
This along with our technical control of the tamper-resistant security module in our terminals represents a formidable barrier to any other player attempting to provide encryption between our terminals and the payment processors.
We have become in effect the de facto standards.
Last month we surpassed the 1 billion transactions milestone.
We saw another great quarter of progress with our Global Bay Mobile Payment solutions initiative selling a record number of new software licenses in Q3 and adding new customers including Ascena and Rue21.
And we continue to work to expand our mobile payment solutions to market outside in North America.
As I mentioned at the start of the call I want to ensure investors of the issues around the recent industry news and implications for VeriFone.
We all know that not every new announcement in the payments ecosystem will eventually gain traction.
But those that do generally find wide adoption by using VeriFone the trusted and incumbent infrastructure provider.
Cards will be with us for the foreseeable future.
Some shoppers will use their phone some will use plastic some will use cash and many will use all of the above.
So retailers are going to need to provide card acceptance system and in fact as the U.S.
adopts EMV there will be a need to be a lot more of them.
It makes more sense for retailers to funnel new forms of electronic payments through their existing electronic payment acceptance systems than try to implement and manage a number of electronic payment streams.
As we mentioned nearly 2 years ago new payment methods need to coexist with the existing world in order to minimize retail disruption provide a consistent consumer experience maintain security and get deployed and managed in an affordable way.
Recently Starbucks decided to switch payment processors from First Data to Chase Paymentech.
And as a result of continued misinformation somehow this was perceived as a negative for VeriFone.
We understand that investor concern is about the wider implications for there being a standard device at retailers.
But please also note that Starbucks is not a VeriFone customer in the U.S.
although we provide critical EMV chip and PIN acceptance capability at many of their international locations.
Starbucks is an example that there have always been alternatives to VeriFone the economics and better security that comes from accepting PIN debit transaction were never compelling to Starbucks because of their low transaction value.
The incumbent point-of-sale provider at Starbucks is MICROS or IBM and they have not been displaced.
Instead this new mobile wallet is prefunded just like PayPal.
Starbucks credit card and signature debit card transactions by plastic must continue as is.
For any new wallet to obtain wider acceptance at retailers we have shown repeatedly that their sponsors consistently come to the conclusion that they need to work with VeriFone.
That happened with Google with Isis and with PayPal.
And we invite any new wallet sponsor to work with VeriFone if they want to obtain wide acceptance of their wallets.
We continue to augment our platform with new forms of payments every day including things like QR codes.
We are working with both McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts mobile initiatives making use of the VeriFone platform.
There will be more wallets announced over the next year.
We aim to be Switzerland and run through all systems  all the viable wallets merchants want to accept.
And if there's a wallet that pops up here or there that doesn't run on our terminal it doesn't obviate us and the many payment methods that do run on VeriFone.
We've never had a monopoly on all forms of payment.
We don't take cash for example.
Our vision continues to focus on offering retailers everywhere a managed service to easily accept all payment types including the evolving alternative and mobile payment modalities being offered by Google PayPal Groupon Isis Visa MasterCard Discover China UnionPay and American Express.
At the same time we can increasingly offer the new payment entrants easy and accelerated access to our worldwide installation of more than 20 million merchant lanes.
As we've previously discussed increasing complexity of the point of sale represents an opportunity for VeriFone.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss in more detail the P&amp;L balance sheet cash flows and guidance.
Thanks Doug.
I'd like to start out by spending some time discussing third quarter revenues compared to our guidance at the beginning of the period quarter.
At $493 million in revenues we were slightly under the $495 million low end of the range and $7 million under the $500 million high end of the range.
There were a number of factors both up and down that netted to this shortfall as Doug discussed in his remarks.
If you're on the webcast you'll see that this slide breaks up the adjustments we have made for acquisitions and currency.
We have decided to start a constant currency discussion this quarter because the impact of currency fluctuations is now much more important for VeriFone than it was in the past.
We have increased exposure due to the additions of Hypercom and Point in the past year our significant organic international growth and recent high volatility of exchange rates.
As you can see from our press release tables we absorbed a currency headwind of $5.3 million in Q1 and $5.2 million in Q2.
And now that has grown to $14.4 million in Q3.
These numbers relate to our organic growth calculation and exclude the effect of Hypercom and Point.
Including the effect of those acquisitions the currency headwind on our pro forma growth in Q3 was $26 million and thus much relevant to understanding our number than has been the case in the past.
We've added the new slide to the deck this quarter to provide our organic revenue growth in constant currency.
We have adjusted non-U.S.
dollar revenues for 2012 using FX rates from the same period a year earlier.
Total organic revenue grew 16% or 21% on a constant currency basis.
North America grew 9% organically and also 9% on a constant currency basis.
Internationally organic growth was 21% but 28% on a constant currency basis.
Despite continued volatility around exchange rates core demand remained strong across all geographies.
And as shown on the table the pro forma revenue grew 5.6% in Q3 which was 11.3% on a constant currency basis.
Non-GAAP gross margins came in at 45.4% an all-time high and an increase of 0.8 points from our second quarter.
System solutions gross margins declined very slightly by 0.1 point.
Service gross margins improved by 2.8 points.
Sequential improvement in service gross margins primarily reflects increased services revenue with a favorable mix towards service offerings that provide us with higher incremental margins such as Point.
And to the prior quarter non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by $0.1 million to $111.7 million.
This decrease reflects favorable FX impact and seasonal benefit from the effect of increase vacation usage on the required vacation accrual partially offset by increased investment to grow the business.
Non-GAAP other expense increased sequentially by $0.5 million primarily due to increased hedging costs.
I'd like to take a minute to discuss our non-GAAP tax rate.
Effective Q3 we have lowered our non-GAAP tax rate to 14% based on our assessment of our longer-term expected rate.
The actual rate this year has been even lower than 14%.
However we were uncertain as to the impact when our 0 tax agreement with the Singapore government expires at the end of this fiscal year and did not want to change the rate until a decision had been reached on the path forward.
We are now in the process of moving our international headquarters from Singapore so we can preserve a near 0 tax rate on much of our terminal sales outside the Americas.
We expect that we'll continue to develop other tax strategies to keep the rate at about this level going forward.
This rate change added $0.03 to our non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter.
Let's take a look at our balance sheet.
Our cash balance at the end of Q3 grew $49 million from the prior quarter to $410 million.
Elsewhere on the balance sheet inventory balances increased by $2.8 million but inventory measured as days of supply decreased by 3 days to 54 days.
Accounts receivable days outstanding was up 3 days to 71 days.
Accounts payable increased $45 million and days payable increased from 47 days to 51 days.
In the third quarter cash flow from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $95 million up nearly $27 million sequentially primarily driven by our non-GAAP net income.
Cash flow from operations was $82 million and free cash flow was $66 million.
We invested $8 million in revenue-generating assets.
As we said last quarter cash flow from operations tend to fluctuate.
And while Q2 cash flow was fairly low it bounced back this quarter as we predicted.
It will continue to fluctuate in future quarters.
But our very strong earnings power should be seen as the main indicator toward continued good cash flow in 2013 and beyond.
Now let's look forward to Q4.
Our guidance for Q4 is for non-GAAP revenues to be between $495 million and $500 million assuming current exchange rates.
This represents high single-digit organic growth and low double-digit pro forma growth at constant currency.
Factored into this guidance is an assumption that currency rates won't to materially change from current rates continued impact from the fire in Brazil a particular missed order because of a product issue that is now being rectified in Brazil and the follow-on effect of the items that Doug has discussed.
We are modeling Latin America revenue in the range of $65 million to $75 million approximately $25 million less than the recent run rate for the reasons we have explained previously.
But please note that we expect Latin America revenue to rebound strongly to be in the $90 million to $95 million range in Q1 of fiscal '13.
We expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.77.
This reflects gross margin staying about the same as Q3 and continued investment in our new initiatives partially offset by productivity improvements we continue to achieve in operating expenses.
On a full year basis for fiscal '12 our guidance is for non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.893 million to $1.898 million and for fiscal '12 full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.73 to $2.75.
For fiscal '13 we are announcing guidance for non-GAAP revenue of $2.05 billion to $2.1 billion and EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.30.
This represents about 10% constant currency organic growth and slightly higher growth on a pro forma basis.
In North America we see mid-single-digit growth in our traditional product portfolio but an accelerated growth from our mobile and advertising initiatives.
Total North America growth should be 9% to 10%.
The significant impact of EMV is not expected until 2014 and 2015 based on prior rollout experience.
We expect Asia to continue to grow strongly and Latin America to grow well from the depressed Q4 levels.
In Europe growth will come from the new Hypercom products now being introduced in Germany and continued market share gains in several other markets partially offset by the Hypercom product weakness in the SMB segment of France.
We expect spending on revenue-generating assets and other capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $120 million.
I should also note that Q1 fiscal '13 revenue will be about the same as its prior quarter due to seasonality and some of the international Q4 issues Doug discussed continuing into Q1 then subsequent revenue will grow quarter-to-quarter fairly uniformly.
The Q1 constant currency growth rate is high single-digits with subsequent quarters growth moving into the high-teens at constant currency.
EPS will dip a few cents in Q1 and then grow uniformly through the rest of fiscal '13.
I'll now turn it over to Doug Bergeron for some concluding remarks.
Thanks Bob.
So we're very pleased with the results and outlook that we're able to communicate to you today.
We continue to focus efforts on developing our competitive advantage which is our ability to bundle encryption services content and advertising gateway services support for multiple new payment methods and e-commerce capabilities to enable our customers to reinvent the retail experience for their consumers.
We're making great strides in the conversion of VeriFone into the world's premier software and services platform for mobile payments card payments and security.
As I said at the beginning of the call I want to ensure investors understand the issues around recent changes in payment processors at Starbucks and how such changes should be interpreted.
As Google Isis and PayPal have demonstrated leading-edge retailers want to support multiple electronic wallets and they want rapid deployment across their entire establishment.
They also understand that plastic cards aren't going way for decades so they need to support them as well and they want to do it all in  a secure PCI-certified way that increasingly includes Chip and PIN capabilities.
Shoppers don't want a different payment method for each shop they visit and retailers themselves want to minimize the complexity of implementation.
The fastest least expensive least disruptive way towards mass deployment is through VeriFone's ability to turn the lights on at over 70% of the U.S.
retail marketplace.
As we complete fiscal year 2012 we have accomplished a great amount.
Our double-digit organic revenue growth accelerated to 16% year-over-year and 21% on a constant currency basis.
Gross margins and operating margins were at an all-time high percentages.
North America revenues in particular accelerated ahead of plan.
And despite a temporary disruption in Brazil demand remains robust in all geographies around including Latin America.
Looking forward to 2013 we see another fantastic year of revenue growth and accelerated earnings and cash flow growth resulting from expanding margins a deleveraging balance sheet and continued success with our software and services initiatives.
Thank you for listening.
And we will now open up the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darrin Peller Barclays.
Research Division</strong> I just want to touch again on the 2013 guidance for a moment.
I think the percent of growth works out to about 8% to 11%.
Bob I think you mentioned earlier that the combination of factors lead to first quarter growth being somewhat slower but then going up to the high-teens.
Is that fair? Did I hear that correctly on a constant currency basis? Yes that's what you heard.
The effects of Latin America obviously are quite severe in Q4 and then starts bouncing back in Q1.
And a little bit of conservatism on some of the other geographies but over the course of the year the growth will resume to pretty good growth rates and into themes.
Research Division</strong> All right.
So had it not been for the onetime-ish type of item in Brazil your full year organic top line growth at constant currency it's mostly organic now also right? Because your anniversary point by the end of the year more or less would've been closer to the mid-teens or so.
Is that about right or just to give us a sense? Yes I would say that inherently this company is still a mid-teens growth company.
Research Division</strong> All right that's helpful.
Just on the U.S.
side one follow-up on the growth rates.
I mean again it looked like it accelerated really quite well in the U.S.
growth.
I know last quarter the ISO channel had experienced a decline which led to your organic growth rate in the U.S.
being somewhat flat.
Can you give us a sense of what changed there? Was it the taxi business getting stronger petroleum business or was it actually improvement in the ISO channel? Yes the small business channel is starting to rebound.
I think that's the first time I've said that in 4 years.
I think there was some inventory adjustment by retailers.
I think by distributors that services small business channel.
I think they have all now adopted a leaner and meaner inventory strategy and we had to work through that.
But fundamental demand is good.
As you said -- as we said earlier petroleum was strong.
Multi-lane was strong and advertising was very strong.
The benefit that we got as a result of the payment-as-a-service deal before that we announced the bus system contract in New York taxi -- it's been the taxi contracts those don't even really hit the income statement because of the way the revenues is recorded over time.
So we not only have financially strong results in our North America segment our backlog of services business in deferred revenue is growing quite strongly as well.
Research Division</strong> All right.
And just last question for me.
Doug do you still see this being a 50% services business in a couple of years? I hope so.
We're focused on everything everywhere around services.
Our general managers our salespeople are compensated to turn what would be a complicated product sale into a more complicated services sale.
It does provide a little bit of a headwind on revenue growth.
I think we can manage through that.
But we're out trying to solve problems for retailers who are trying to reinvent themselves become PCI and EMV compliant run these mobile wallets.
And my sense is the more complexity that’s out there the more of an opportunity will be for us to not sell devices but sell services.
In the developing world where product sophistication is much lower throughout Asia Latin America certainly in Sub-Saharan Africa we'll still continue to sell boatloads of products versus services and hence that's why we still think there'll be a lot of products in our business.
Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> Just I guess I want to ask about the Brazil issue again just to make sure I got the facts straight.
When did that happen exactly? And was it remedied? I guess what gives you confidence in that Q1 number that you're sharing with us for Latin America? It's -- the fire occurred in the last month of the quarter a few weeks 2 or 3 weeks before the end of the quarter.
And we are now as of September 1 fully operational in our new facility.
So there was some impact on the current quarter.
Most of the quarter -- most of the impact was in August which is our Q4 number.
It not only affected services revenue but it's hard to sell products with services contracts attached to them when the customer knows that your place is burnt down.
So we've now recovered from all of that.
And we have confidence that things will rebound in Q1.
Yes the fire occurred July 7 just for clarity there.
Research Division</strong> July 7 okay.
Yes that will make sense on the product side you just said Doug so I guess system sales outlook for fiscal '13 in Latin America specifically Brazil what does your guidance assume there? Because I know obviously you've been getting a lot of question I'm sure about the tough comps with Brazil now maybe there could be some knock-on effects from this fire the service issue so I'm curious what the assumption is that we should be thinking about for Lat-Am in fiscal '13.
Yes I think Bob mentioned that we could see revenues rebounding back to the $90 million-plus range in Q1 and with some sequential improvement maybe non-monotonically but in general a sequential improvement to our quarter-over-quarter throughout 2013.
Latin America is a very good place of business for us.
We have commanding market share in most markets and at least 50% market share in Brazil.
Our customers want us need us and love us and we'll have a great 2013.
Research Division</strong> Okay good.
Just last one.
Just I appreciate all the high-level comments.
It's good to hear.
Just with all the stuff around cloud QR codes NFC I'm curious Doug since the last time we spoke I guess on a public call what -- has your view changed on what the winning technology is going to be? And what do you think this all means for long-term ASPs for your traditional system sales? I think as I've said repeatedly retailers want to play with some of this stuff.
They're not all leading-edge first movers.
But once a new concept is proven in order to implement it they want it implemented part and parcel to the rest of the infrastructure.
They can't send certain consumers to certain lanes and other consumers to other lanes.
So if QR codes for example become a bona fide way to redeem prepaid balances from a prepaid card in a coffee shop then the retailer is going to want a QR code capability managed with its existing infrastructures.
It's probably also going to want some sort of gateway or cloud-based reconciliation service is also going to probably want to ensure that things are encrypted.
So we feel very comfortable about the payment complexity at the point-of-sale increasing over time and that's typically a very good leading indicator for ASPs and gross margin.
Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Tough timing Doug.
It looks like the fire occurred middle of the day after you bought the stock.
So I guess as a follow-up to Tien-Tsin's question on Brazil as well as what you're seeing in terms of the SME market in France for Hypercom what gives you confidence that the disruptions in these markets don't provide an opening for your competition to come in and sort of structurally change the share construct on the ground? Is -- are there specific barriers in your mind that don't make these disruptions more than transitory? I think in every market customers pray for the healthy exist -- coexistence of 2 suppliers.
And I know we have many customers in France just waiting with bated breath for us to get through these Hypercom product deficiencies that we inherited so they can continue to resume buying from us.
Brazil I feel that we're already through the fire.
We had an awful August but we're going to have a strong September and hopefully an even stronger October.
And I see no -- absolutely no long-term fundamental structural damage to our business.
It's -- we went and visited every one of our customers in Brazil and explained what happened that it was beyond our control and they were all very very supportive of our efforts to get back to business.
And I'd also like to add that in France the disruption isn't affecting our sales to the level 1 merchants.
We have the bulk of the market share with the large retailers in France and that's not affected by these issues.
It's a different type of terminal than -- relative to the small SMB segment.
So that level 1 merchant business remains extremely healthy for us.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And is that as disproportionate component of your French revenues as it is in the U.S.? Well actually right now it's even higher yes.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right.
But normally you're still weighted toward level 1 merchants on a normalized basis? Yes.
Well in France I mean we're relatively weaker in the SMB business than we are in U.S.
So -- and in fact we have probably even a higher market share in Level 1 than we do in the U.S.
as big as the U.S.
market share is.
So that weighting in France is much more skewed toward level 1 than the SMB today.
But as we go through these product issues we will rectify that in the SMB segment.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I think you mentioned that your petroleum revenues were up 17% is that right north American petroleum in the quarter? Yes.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And is that in the absence of a meaningful ramp in the pump media revenue component of that business and how should we think about that? No the sales of the secure pump pay system has to precede the meaningful accumulation of revenue from media.
So we're busy.
I don't know how many have been sold off the top of my head or installed but we think sales of media into that channel will begin in earnest in 2013.
You just need to hit that tipping point that critical mass that we've mentioned before of 15 000 20 000 25 000 screens before you can get any national interest by the major media buyers as a bona fide venue to spend some other digital out of home advertising moneys.
So the strength that we have in pay trade that we're referring to there is really coming from selling the POS equipment in the convenience store.
When you go to the convenience store and say you want $10 on pumps because that large device that we're selling is doing very well.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay so not the Secure PumpPAY module per se.
That still is a largely services-oriented revenue stream? Yes yes.
Our next question comes from Phil Stiller Citi.
Research Division</strong> I just wanted to ask about the gross margin.
You guys have pretty good gross margins here in the third quarter particularly on the service side.
Was there anything unusual in that? And are those the type of margins we should expect for services going forward? Yes I think what we made there was a mixed shift the growth is all coming from the higher-margin parts of the service business.
The break-fix business tends to be a lower growth.
So over time the mix will be positive.
But as I indicated for Q4 we're just assuming the gross margin will be about the same as Q3.
Research Division</strong> And is there any impact from the Brazil fire the margin profile of the business that we should expect in the fourth quarter? Well I guess you could say in theory the break-fix business have burned down.
So there may be some impact there.
But as...
I guess positive -- I assume percentage.
Research Division</strong> Yes yes.
But you hadn't thought of it that way? Yes hadn't thought of it that way.
I wouldn't -- I just assume it's about the same.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And what type of overall margins are implied by the fiscal '13 guidance at this point? Well we're exiting hopefully Q4 with as Bob just said 45% gross margins operating margins around 23% which is outstanding performance.
I know my board is very happy with that.
And due to Bob's stellar work on tax very strong net margin.
Our assumption is that's the baseline for 2013.
Again Q1 might be a little lower on some of those counts because the revenue won't -- it'll be pretty flat actually I would think.
And then potentially some continued margin improvement throughout the year.
It's -- you can map margin improvement to how we're doing on some of our higher-margin services payment-as-a-service in Australia in the U.S.
which is taking off in the U.S.
throughout Scandinavia some of the other markets that we're introducing it in Europe.
Advertising sales and more taxi contracts and advertising revenue from pumps all will be accretive to gross margin percentages.
And obviously operating margin percentages.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just for clarity's sake the guidance assumes the 14% tax rate going forward.
Is that right? Yes.
Our next question comes from Wayne Johnson Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> If we could just talk a little bit about the VeriShield Protect.
If I heard correctly the number of retailers won is 101.
Is that correct? 105.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> 105 my apologies.
These are named retailers.
Many of them have hundreds of stores.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And so of the 105 how many are enabled? I don't have that number call it 60% 70% 75%.
And usually between signing and encrypting there's 3 to -- used to be 9 to 12 months.
It's now 3 to 4 months because we're live at all of the processors now.
We've mastered or achieved some productivity gains in terms of implementations.
So there's a lag.
I guess if you look at our script 2 scripts ago so whatever number we had let's say 6 months ago would be probably the number that are live now if you just assume that 6-month lag.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right.
And so how many would you target let's say a year from now in terms of number of retailers won just the large retailers? I don't know Wayne.
We haven't given that number before.
I tend to feel that it's accelerating.
I don't know what the shape of that accelerated curve is.
And I don't want to be overly optimistic and put a number out there that we can't make.
But it's the right thing to do.
We're retailers that are worried about the impact to their business in the event of a breach and the impact to their brand in the event of a breach.
And we expect it will continue to be a hot seller.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And if I could change topics here.
So just so I'm clear if we look at any geography excluding the fire in Brazil excluding the Hypercom product problems in France is there any other area where there's weakness just economically speaking you thought growth was going to be 10% and it came in at 5%? Is there any pockets of weakness that we should be aware of? I think the only other -- I don't want to sound like -- but the only other thing that we pointed to that was weak was Germany also with the Hypercom product.
The good news there is this quarter we’ve begun shipping the next generation product there and we're going to have a great 2013.
We're not yet shipping the fixed product in France.
We're still a quarter or 2 away from that unfortunately.
But every other -- and you saw it in the regional description every other -- every geography even EMEA that shows you how strong EMEA is really doing with the -- even considering that problem the organic growth rates on a constant currency basis for EMEA show a very strong progress.
And obviously some market share gains as well.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And departing question here on the system solutions gross profit margins how should we think about that going forward? And what's your guys target kind of 3 years out? I don't think that's where you're going to see huge gross margin expansion.
It's going to move around 50 to 100 basis points.
But where they are now I think is likely where they'll end up longer-term.
The real gross margin expansion for us will be with turning more of those sales into services sales encryption advertising and things of that order.
Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Bob real quick question just in terms of the CapEx split for the guidance I think you gave for next year.
Can you give us that on the revenue-generating side as well as just the PP&amp;E side just so we have a percentage mix or some way to think about the splits there? PP&amp;E generally runs about 20 million a year.
So...
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Yes that make sense okay.
And then also similarly on the margin assumptions I think I might have missed it but it sounded like you were asked about margins for next year.
What were the sort of implied run rates for the non-GAAP margin assumptions for fiscal '13? Well [indiscernible] we said that you can model in about margins about flat with where they are now and you'll end up with our EPS guidance.
What Doug mentioned though is where we'll seek to find upside would be improvements in the percentage of services as a percentage of the total revenues.
That will improve the margins.
But also the improvement of the types of services that we do that growth is all going to be out of the Point type businesses advertising and things like that as supposed to the break-fix.
And so the margin and service themselves will go up.
But I think you can reach our guidance was about flat gross margin numbers.
Research Division</strong> Okay got it good.
And Doug just as you think about Point and the introduction of that model here in the U.S.
I know that that's always a question here that we get where folks want to understand what is it about Point that's different.
How do we think about that model? And I know you guys have tried to explain this ad nauseam and on different emphasis.
Is there maybe just some quick 2 or 3 point way in terms of maybe how you sell it that investors and some of us here can get just a better appreciation for what it is that you're bringing to the table as far as customers are concerned? Is it the lease model is it the Software and the services? What is it about the Point model if you will in that payment-as-a-service structure that we need to make sure we understand and how it will sell for you guys as you think about its transition into the U.S.? Well years ago these mid-sized retailers would buy systems from a processor starting 5 or 6 years ago as our direct to retail business grew we started selling them directly to retailers ourselves and develop a great franchise with them.
The discussion typically starts around show me what I can buy today to become PCI compliant and prepare for EMV.
But the sales cycle very often also starts talking about managing these systems managing security updates how to run the Google Wallet the Isis Wallet the PayPal wallet.
And pretty soon and fairly consistent the mid-sized retailer I'm talking about the Little Caesars of the world if you will puts its hand up and says "Wow this is a lot of complexity.
Payment used to be easy.
I could buy a product.
What can you do to help solve that complexity problem?" When we say listen instead of buying these products from us why don't we sign a managed services agreement and you can check this box or check that box depending on what types of additional features you need.
It'll include a 24x7 help desk.
It will include replacements in case of breakages.
It'll include managing EMV updates remotely.
And typically you also won a gateway of services well because many of these new forms of payments aren't going to go to the payment processors.
And therefore a retailer needs a new way to reconcile all transactions not just the traditional transaction.
So we provide end of day end of month-type and real-time web-based reconciliation reporting for those merchant.
And when you look at companies like the ones I just mentioned earlier they run at 10% 11% 12% operating margins.
They don't have hundreds of people in payment IT.
So we're solving a problem for them keeping them compliant keeping their names out of the paper because we're typically also bundling encryption with it and we're solving a big problem for them for a small monthly fee per lane.
Our next question comes from John Williams UBS.
Research Division</strong> Question on EMV.
So thematically I get it it's something that's coming down the pipe.
It's pretty clear both the networks have signed on and it will be here.
And I guess the disconnect on my side is specifically how we can A think about the time line? And B think about the impact on ASPs for your product? And I guess what I'm trying to figure out is the incremental bump that you should get in revenue related to EMV.
In other words you've got these -- got an upgrade cycle coming how much more is it going to add? Well the vast majority of the 7 million payment terminals that are installed in the United States of which 5 million are say VeriFone are not EMV ready.
Just the ones that we're selling now and in fact I think we announced it 25% or 30% of the ones that we're now selling today has the smart card slot but they don't have the EMV softer.
We will provide that at a later date once the spec has been finalized.
So we're talking about single-digit percentage saturation.
What we have said in terms of ASPs in the past is we operate in a competitive world.
There's an alternative for retailers.
I think they prefer VeriFone and they've got a great feeling for our products.
But we haven't seen ASP upgrade -- uplifts in EMV countries.
I mean it's really more of a software issue and the software is a onetime cost for us to write and the market dynamics have kept systems prices pretty flat.
The real upside for us though is the expansion of the addressable market.
We went out of our way this quarter to show how a company like Choice Hotels who typically would accept a new credit card you would hand it over to a reservation agent at the front desk is now anticipating EMV entering a world where they're going to have to have a customer facing systems in front of each reservation agent.
Our guess is that the total addressable market in the U.S.
will move from 7 million lanes to 11 million lanes.
And my guess is given our strong channel and direct sales force in the U.S.
towards any competitor we will get our lion share of that additional 4 million lane.
I don't have any reason to expect that most merchants won't wait 'til closer to the deadline.
The deadline is October 15.
I also -- having sat through 30 or 40 other countries EMV rollouts know that deadlines get extended by 1 year or 2.
So if we get some windfall in 2013 we're not -- it's not in our guidance.
We're not expecting that the new market the place where it will hit P&amp;L will really be impactful until 2014.
Certainly it will be in 2015.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
That's helpful.
Another question related to Hypercom I don't know if I missed it did you give revenue or growth or something we can back into for Hypercom for the quarter? And the second part is given that that business seems to have pretty meaningfully underperformed and continued to do so at what point do you look to potentially take a write-down on the goodwill related to that acquisition? Well we're operating well above any type of impairment threshold.
We've been pretty catholic in terms of just declaring Hypercom's sales of Hypercom products to former Hypercom customers we're already benefiting from sales of VeriFone products to those customers.
We're calling that organic.
But that's certainly one of the beneficial outcomes of the acquisition.
Listen what we said in the beginning when we acquired the business was that there would be some revenue dissynergies in a few markets particularly in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia.
That's inevitable.
There were some markets in the world where it was just VeriFone and Hypercom.
That was a free gift to Ingenico obviously and I think it's juiced their -- what they can call organic revenue growth rates for 2013.
They'll have to lap for 2012 I should say.
That's nonrecurring.
Those -- they're going to have to grow those customers on their own now.
And we didn't anticipate but we had to deal with a less than robust product set for both France and Germany 2 geographies that we deemed were part of the strategic rationale.
If -- once those products are fully out Germany is out now finally and France is coming we fully expect that we'll achieve our revenue growth rates for the Hypercom products in those markets.
The Hypercom revenue is actually on Slide 17 $68.5 million in Q3.
Research Division</strong> And your expectation just to refresh coming into the quarter had you -- as you said what you thought it would be? I'm sorry I didn't hear that.
Research Division</strong> Your expectation headed into the quarter was there a general number or could I find that somewhere? I just -- I don't recall...
Well we -- no I wouldn't -- I'm not going to give you a particular number but we did indicate that part of our weakness was that SMB Hypercom business in France maybe a little bit weaker than we expected.
We know that part of the decline from the prior quarter continued to be the weakness in Germany.
But that's now rectified.
So to further answer your original question as we rectify the business in Germany and France we think that the value of the Hypercom business will meet its expectations.
That's not going to be an issue.
I don't anticipate they would write it down.
And over time our voice has been quite clear that we'll end up with product rationalization where VeriFone products will replace the technically Hypercom products over time over multiple years.
So actually it won't be a measurable number although starting fairly soon actually.
I might add also having Hypercom under VeriFone has a -- hard to quantify but certainly positive impact on overall gross margins across the portfolio.
And I'll just leave it at that.
Our next question comes from Gil Luria Wedbush.
Research Division</strong> So first Bob you talked about the free cash flow strengthening.
It did a little bit in the quarter but you're still below your reported net income for the year.
You've had a lot of restructuring.
You've integrated 2 large acquisitions.
But now that those are integrated looking to fiscal '13 and you're guiding $3.25 to $3.30 on earnings is that what we should also expect for free cash flow? Well the -- if you look at our adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP obviously we had a lot of integration expense in the first quarter of this year.
That has declined quarter-by-quarter.
And it's just a few million dollars in the current quarter.
So I would say those adjustments have declined.
As we go forward barring any significant acquisitions that would just dwindle down to almost nothing.
And except for that -- actually it's a reverse adjustment that we take out some of exchange rate adjustments for Israel where we have a tax liability that we'll never end up paying.
So there's always been an adjustment there.
But I would say that the -- you can expect that our working capital over time will always be slightly negative because we will have to grow working capital as the business grows.
That will be the one thing to look to.
And then of course we'll make these investments as we indicated in the revenue-generating assets.
But I think it should -- it will get fairly close.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then you're reducing the tax rate going forward to 14%.
So next year if you kept the 18% it would have been it would imply a guidance of more like $3.10 $3.15 but that's $3.25 to $3.30 because of the lower tax rate.
Yes.
And we're are our guidance from where our analysts are at the moment and that's the way we like to do things.
So yes you could -- yes you could point to tax rate as being a difference.
But there are whole bunch of other things you could say are up and down between the -- where we were a quarter ago and where we are now as well.
I think that you should think about one thing and say well if it wasn't for that it would have been this other.
We could say if it wasn't for the fire it would have been another number as well I think we...
Well we had a $23 million if you include the impact of FX on our acquisitions as well.
$23 million headwind in the quarter in addition to the fire due to foreign exchange I mean -- and the foreign exchange issue continues in Q4 Q1 and even into I guess ends in Q2.
But -- so we've got a couple more quarters to anniversary that out of these numbers too.
Remember the -- although  it's recently corrected a little bit at one point the U.S.
dollar had appreciated 9% on a constant -- on a basket of currencies.
And this is a business the 70% of its business is outside of U.S.
So that's a -- it's a big number.
So we think the most appropriate way is to say we raised our guidance our EPS guidance so lots of ins and outs.
Research Division</strong> Sounds good.
And then on the fire so that's about $35 million that are coming out of this year and maybe some of it even moving into next year.
Does your 10% constant currency organic growth rate account for that account for -- adjust that $35 million back into this year or are you factoring for that at all? No no.
When we do constant currency we don't mean constant fire or something like that.
It's just constant currency.
So we use the base.
So if we were talking about fourth quarter of next year we would use the fourth quarter of this year's low number adjust that for the currency and then compare it to next year.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
It makes sense.
And then one last question.
A couple of companies in a similar industry NCR and Diebold have had some issues around FCPA and OFAC recently that have had a pretty detrimental impact on either their business or their stock price.
What kind of mechanisms do you guys have to make sure that you don't have an FCPA issue? You do business in the same countries with often the same customers.
What kind of controls do you have to make sure that doesn't happen? So quite extensive.
We have a very effective internal audit department.
And we have -- our general managers are continuing to preach too about this issue.
We really worry about the term for the top and make sure that in our sales meetings that our CEO and I talk to the general managers about this issue and we have taken disciplinary actions not on FCPA per se but on other areas where people in these countries weren't operating in the most ethical manner.
And we made changes.
And so we made it very clear with our actions that we don't tolerate any unethical behavior and we bounce people pretty quickly.
So hasn't resolved the FCPA issues and I think just that whole nature of us continually policing and addressing these issues on a pretty stringent basis our case is clean in that regard.
The other mechanism we use something that worked well for me and another company is the local controllers should not be reporting to the local General Manager.
They should report to a worldwide controller and they should be basically a German Shepherd on-site watching every move that the local operators are doing in terms of our code of conduct in all respects.
And when the police are at the side of the road you tend not to exceed the speed limit so it's kind of that phenomenon.
It's actually short but that is the case of VeriFone.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
And then so -- but then on the other issue that came up for NCR was around OFAC.
Do you know if there's any VeriFone terminals being sold in Syria Iran? Do you have any control over that? Do you have special licenses to sell terminals in those countries? Any control if your distributors are selling there? Is that something you're also keeping an eye on? Well it's prohibited.
So today I'm pretty confident we don't sell terminals into those countries.
We have control as special software you can get for our Oracle system that would actually catch somebody if they put a ship to address of a prohibited country.
And then there are prohibited customers that the State Department issues.
And so we -- the software picks up that type of thing as well.
So it's not to say that it couldn't get there their third or fourth party-type situations but our policing today is pretty thorough about those things.
Our next question comes from the line of Meghna Ladha Susquehanna.
LLLP Research Division</strong> So the 2013 revenue growth guidance came in below expectations.
But regarding your long-term growth targets Doug how confident are you in achieving the mid-teens revenue growth target that you had set for the company? And when do you think we could see that kind of growth? Well our -- on a constant currency basis we're still in a range of 10% to 15% I think around almost 11%.
That's our target.
I think we have a long history.
But for raging fires in Brazil we have a long history of meeting our targets.
So we'll have this conversation at the end of 2013.
But my hope is throughout the year we will continue to perform barring some macroeconomic slowdown or something that we can't control.
And I remain confident given the breadth of products that we have the breadth of markets that we serve the fact that we're so leveraged to the emerging markets' economies with over 40% of our revenue there and the types of innovations that we're involved with that are expanding our footprint into more areas to advertise more encryption business more taxi more transportation projects that we can be a mid-teen grower for many many years.
And I'd point out that in my prepared remarks I said that the growth rate would be into the mid-teens by the end of the fiscal year.
It's going to grow quarter-by-quarter on a year-to-year basis.
LLLP Research Division</strong> Okay got it.
And my last question is that so it seem like tablets are changing the landscape at the point-of-sale.
So what kind of demand are you seeing for your Global Bay and PAYware solution? And can you just remind us how you price these services to the merchant? We're seeing outstanding demand for both our Global Bay solutions and our PAYware Enterprise Solutions which turn an iPod or on iPad into a bona fide secured payment solution that meets all of the PCI and even EMV capabilities.
We're operating ahead of plan.
I don't know that number off the top of my head and we expect about 100% growth in 2013.
There's a very large national retailer that has been in the news recently.
I'm not going to name them because of their CEO's interest in reinventing retail.
You're going to be seeing a lot of VeriFone encryption capabilities at that retailer over the next several months.
We sold multi-million dollars of solutions to them.
Many of our -- or most all of our Global Bay software is priced on a per-unit per month basis.
It's Software as a Service.
Some of the application lives on the client on the tablet or on the smartphone.
And some of the application is cloud hosted.
So that's how that revenue makes its way into our income statement Yes so rather talking about revenue I think to talk about the profit that we get from it is more profitable for us to sell out our Global Bay and the PAYware type solution than those actually to sell a piece of hardware because this was a quite sophisticated software that is integrated into lot of the other systems that retailers have.
And so there is a significant value add in that change.
So we actually are better off if the world was to have a much more of these that is a high growth area for us and our margins.
Our next question comes from Mike Grondahl Piper Jaffray.
Research Division</strong> Two questions.
One could you just maybe highlight for us a little bit your strategy with Point USA how you're exactly going to the market there and your goals? And then maybe secondly in the hospitality space you mentioned Choice Hotels and their 6 200 franchised hotels.
What really drove them to VeriFone? And are there other hospitality clients or hotels that you think will be there or not? We hope so.
We also think restaurants with EMV will become a hot market for us given our excellent relationship with MICROS in particular and also NCR and Radiant.
Consumers are not going to give up their Chip and PIN card to the waiter nor they're going to give up their phone to the waiter.
So most checkout transactions are going to be done at the table and that's going to be helpful to us.
But the sales campaign is focused on the top 1 000 national retailers.
We're typically not pitching the payment-as-a-service option to the top 50 because they have fairly sophisticated payment in-house payment integration expertise that may change once EMV is here.
But it's the retailer 51 to retailer 1 000 who wants to play in this new world of payment but wants to be secure and wants to do it without a big CapEx upfront and wants an adult in a room if you will to hold their hand.
They need an advocate because at 9:00 a.m.
in the morning somebody from Google shows up.
At 11:00 somebody from Isis shows up.
At 3:00 somebody from PayPal shows up.
And by 5:00 their hair is on fire.
And they want somebody to help them implement all of this stuff in a concise secure consistent manner that regression test against everything else and can look at them in the eye and say "You can call me anytime in night and day and all of these wallets and all of these old forms of payment will continue to work." That's the pitch.
That's what's resonating.
That's what Point has done so remarkably well in Northern Europe.
That's why Bank of Queensland in Australia has recently signed on for us to take over management of their retail partners.
And that's why I think this will be a real success for us over the years to come.
It's not going to be easy prior to EMV.
EMV is the killer problem if you will.
But all of these new wallets that are announced everyday are very helpful to that story.
So it seems that every press report people are saying well was VeriFone involved we're not involved in every pilot everywhere.
But the fact is if you want to go mass deployment with it and you don't want to rip out everything that's currently working in your stores especially for a trial it's best to implement it as a service on your VeriFone infrastructure.
Our final question comes from Keith Housum Northcoast Research.
Just to revisit Brazil one more quick moment the business that was lost in August and some of July do you think that went away or is that pent-up demand that's just waiting for production to catch up to fill that demand? That went away.
I should sleep over it Ingenico should send me a box of cigars.
We're both very credible suppliers in Brazil.
We're both certified connected to all of the networks and that business went to Ingenico for sure.
Okay fair enough.
And then you mentioned in your opening remarks Doug that PayPal you guys sold 15 000 mobile licenses to for the wallet.
Can you just provide a little bit of color in terms of how you guys are going to benefit from like PayPal and selling more licenses? Do you get a cut of the action or how are you guys benefiting? We charge the retailer or PayPal and pay the retailer or but -- in this case buy directly from us a per lane license for the applet that has to -- that we have written with their spec that we've certified and that has to be deployed.
So it's a per lane onetime fee.
But it's like any other applet or any app that you would download from App Store.
As you want more features and functions you have to repay and buy it again.
So it's not a maintenance model.
It's just -- it's a onetime model.
But there's enough volatility and change in these e-wallets that we're very comfortable that this a real business model sitting here.
Got you okay.
And then follow up question I assume that Visa's coming out with their own point-to-point encryption offering.
I guess any thoughts on how it's going to compete with your encryption? I mean are they complementary or they do the same thing? Well obviously they encrypt.
But I think when you really dig behind what Visa is talking about it is as they say zone focused and mostly talking about the interaction between Visa and the payment processors that communication.
They do have some direct retailer relationships very large retailers go direct to Visa with part of their transactions.
And so there was an opportunity for us to work with them in that direct-to-retail.
But for the bulk of the retailers Visa doesn't actually have the direct relationship because they're a payment processor and we've already signed up a bulk of the payment processors for that leg of the transaction.
But it's certainly viable to think of -- as multiple legs you got from the retailer to the payment processor.
And that's what we have covered they have within inside the payment processor and so there are several companies working on that space and then you have from the payment processor to the card networks and to the -- and for the card networks actually to the card issuers.
So there are other legs of the transaction.
We're focused on the retailer to the payment processor.
And there are no further questions.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Bergeron.
All right.
Well thank you everyone.
We're very proud of the quarter.
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm very proud of all the efforts that people are making inside of VeriFone a bit of a challenge in August but we will prevail and we've got a great business ready for 2013.
I'll see you next quarter.
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes the presentation.
Thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a great day.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 VeriFone Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Bergeron CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and good afternoon everyone.
We are pleased with the results of our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.
Q4 non-GAAP revenues were $489 million an 18% increase over the previous year.
Excluding the impact of all acquisitions over the past 12 months organic revenue growth was 4%.
On a constant currency basis however organic revenue growth was 8%.
Non-GAAP services revenue continued to expand and comprised a record 31% of total revenues in Q4.
Non-GAAP gross margins were 44.2% of revenue.
Non-GAAP operating margins were 23% of revenue.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.76 per share an increase of 43% over Q4 last year.
That 43% growth rate matched the growth we generated for the full fiscal year.
We delivered a stellar year of bottom line growth for our shareholders.
Today I will review our performance by region and follow with comments on some of our strategic activities.
Finally I will turn the call over to Bob who will provide a detailed review of the financials and update guidance.
Let's begin with North America which had a fantastic quarter with sales up 26% compared to a year ago and 5% sequentially.
Organically revenues were up 22%.
Q4 was our highest North American revenue quarter in history.
As a result of our investments in new technology and solutions over the past 2 years we now believe that North America will be a strong contributor to the company's growth for the next couple of years.
In the fourth quarter 26% of the systems we shipped in the U.S.
were chip card enabled as we continue to see interest in EMV.
We will sell the EMV software later to make the systems fully EMV ready once U.S.
industry standards are completed and announced.
Our multilane retail sales business reached record levels with over 50% year-over-year growth.
The MX 900 Series continues to have incredible success with wins at Gymboree Target Kroger Bass Pro Shops H&amp;M Sleep Train and the UPS store.
We are pleased to note that Target was a competitive steal from the former Hypercom U.S.
business that we divested.
In Q4 we completed the rollout for the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority contract for bus systems and dispatching software in the Bronx having won the Staten Island contract previously.
Our North American petroleum revenue was up 8% compared to a year ago driven by BP Marathon Cisco and Sonoco-branded stations upgrading their VeriFone Gemstone systems to our keyboard touchscreen model in the kiosk and convenience stores.
Valero has decided to implement VeriFone's PAYMEDIA for Secure PumpPAY in an initial pilot at corporate-operated gas stations in the Austin Texas area.
Installations begin in -- began in Q4.
This represents a 3 500-pump opportunity if the pilot is successful.
PAYMEDIA content is managed by VeriFone Media and broadcast via the VeriFone Digital Network or VNET.
Digital content delivered via VNET includes news weather and entertainment from content partner NBCUniversal.
This content is accompanied by highly targeted advertising and couponing offers that can draw customers inside the petroleum retailer's convenience store.
It's important to note that the bulk of the economics in gas station retail is in the relatively high-margin convenience store not at the pump.
The goal here is to get the customer to enter the store.
Couponing is the newest addition to the VeriFone Digital Network.
After a successful 12-month pilot the coupon redemption rates in excess of 10% far exceeded industry norms for free-standing inserts.
Couponing is now being rolled out to our PAYMEDIA customers.
Robinson Oil is now implementing VNET at all of its 34 Rotten Robbie retail locations in Northern California.
Robinson Oil is also implementing VeriFone's -- VeriFone Media's LIFT Retail Technology allowing marketers to target cross-sell and upsell messaging to consumers at the checkout based on real-time analysis of the items they are purchasing.
In addition to Robinson Oil we are currently in pilot with Kroger Sonoco Hess Ricker's and Motomart representing a total opportunity of over 2 200 convenience stores.
The experience with these several hundred pilot locations has been exceptional.
On average convenience store revenue increases 4% to 7% during the first months of operation yielding tens of thousands of dollars per year of incremental profitability per location.
Our business model is based on a managed services arrangement with retailers plus advertising revenue from the consumer packaged goods companies.
Over the past 6 months we have recruited several key talented executives from Catalina Marketing.
In the state of Minnesota we have begun facilitating the sale of lottery tickets at the pumps of many gas stations making it very convenient for motorists to play at the pump while refueling their vehicles.
VeriFone is paid for every ticket sold.
We hope to expand this initiative to 3 to 5 other states during fiscal year 2013.
Revenues in our North American small business sector were up 1% year-over-year with distributor inventory levels dropping to the lowest level in several years.
U.S.
sales were actually up 11% on a year-over-year basis but lower sales into Canada offset most of this gain.
We expect increased traction in Canada when we release our 3G version of the VX 680 in January.
Now I'd like to take a moment to talk about our micro-merchant initiative which have branded SAIL.
Earlier this year we launched SAIL as a way to bridge the gap between the way our traditional channel partners conduct business and the specific needs of very small micro-merchants.
Our experience through 2012 with tens of thousands of these micro-merchants tells us that the standalone economics of micro-merchant acquiring is fundamentally unprofitable and destined to be a negative gross margin business.
Customer acquisition costs either through research engines or TV advertising cannot and will never justify the razor-thin margins produced by merchants with infrequent volume and extremely high attrition.
I think you can see evidence of other competitors' similar experience as they shift their own business models to wallets.
My belief is that the only possible survivors in this fundamentally challenging business model will be companies who might have a opportunity to provide other services to these micro-merchants.
VeriFone will help its traditional partners leverage their significant competitive advantages over standalone dongle companies by providing our technology in gateway services.
Therefore we have decided to focus exclusively on an indirect distribution channel strategy for providing mobile payment solutions to micro-merchants.
And as a result the assets that we have developed around customer acquisition risk management and customer billing will be divested.
The P&amp;L impact from discontinuing this operation and the expected terms of the divestiture are not material.
Now VeriFone will continue to offer a channel-driven version of SAIL and will continue the SAIL brand globally as with the recent SAIL EMV launch.
Turning to taxis.
Our U.S.
taxi revenue grew in Q4 both sequentially and annually.
And as discussed last quarter we won the Washington D.C.
competition for all of their 6 500 cabs a 5-year contract worth from $35 million to $45 million depending on advertising revenues a review that has been requested by some of the losing bidders.
While the review continues we are working with cab operators in Washington to install our systems directly.
We just signed a major deal with Frias Transportation Management the largest taxi limo and shuttle company in Las Vegas.
Vegas is one of the most lucrative advertising markets in the world and second only to New York for taxi revenues.
The deal extends our relationship with Frias to 10 years and expands the opportunity from approximately $65 million to over $90 million in revenue from advertising and payment transactions.
Advertisers will pay us to run ads on high-definition tablets in the back seats of cabs and to run ads on new and eye-catching digital and traditional taxi top displays.
Given that every Vegas cab with a customer-facing payment device is using VeriFone technology and given our extensive rights to display ads in many other ways on and in cabs and shuttles we blanket the city and give advertisers unparalleled access to Vegas visitors.
Today the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission announced the approval of a pilot program for electronic hailing of taxis.
VeriFone will be participating in the e-hailing market as well.
However with most of the press activity focused on the hailing and booking functions increasing the efficiency and security with which passengers can pay for a taxi ride and leave the cab immediately has long been overlooked.
To this end we have already begun testing in New York City VeriFone's digital wallet platform for taxis and car services that allows passengers to simply get into a taxi tap their phone once at any time and get out at the end of the ride whether they hailed the taxi with an app or raised their hand the old-fashioned way.
Our underlying proprietary technology uses high-frequency sound with error correction and allows for secure transmission of payment credentials tip preferences and electronic receipt request in a single tap.
It works with the vast majority of smartphones on the market today not just those with NFC.
For example it works with the iPhone.
Maintaining our traditional position of being Switzerland in the payment space and supporting all mobile wallets including our own our intention is to license this platform to all New York taxi secure PIM providers and any apps they want to offer the highest level of speed and security to customers whether for use in taxis or other retail environment.
We intend to have our mobile payments in taxis available for general use by mid-January and we'll announce more in the new year.
VeriShield Protect our end-to-end encryption software business for securing cardholder data at a merchant continues to expand.
We now have a total of 160 national merchants signed up for this offering with 57% of them live as of October 31.
Merchants going live this last quarter include MARS Microsoft Retail Sizzler LEGO Pep Boys Shoe Carnival Orchard Supply Sony Kitchen Collection and Bag 'N Save.
Year-over-year revenue growth was over 100%.
We now have 1.7 billion annual transactions under contract using VeriFone encryption services.
Our GlobalBay Mobile payment solutions initiative continues to make great progress adding Fossil Sally Beauty Marc Jacobs Kate Spade Monica Chang Coach Asia and Guess? Asia to the list of customers.
GlobalBay offers sophisticated retail software which a merchant can combine with our PAYware Mobile Enterprise device to enable a tablet or a handset to accept payments.
We continue to work to expand this mobile payment solution to markets outside North America with recent wins in Brazil and in Mexico.
We've partnered with Fujitsu to offer retailers sophisticated mobile retailing solutions powered by VeriFone GlobalBay software and integrated with the Fujitsu GlobalSTORE solution or as a standalone mobile point-of-sale.
The co-branded solutions provide Fujitsu retail customers with a sophisticated mobile point-of-sale enabling retailers to serve consumers from anywhere in the store.
They feature support for advanced mobile payment acceptance including digital wallets and alternative payments.
Retailers are looking to mobile solutions to increase revenue improve store operations and enhance the consumer shopping experience.
The vast array of emerging mobile devices payment technologies and the loyalty and promotional offers presents retailers with the complex landscape to navigate through.
Retailers are relying on their trusted partners to help them make sense and to capitalize on this new world of mobile.
This partnership between VeriFone and Fujitsu like the previously announced partnership between VeriFone and Oracle provides a clear roadmap for meeting their needs now and well into the future.
Overall we expect revenue from GlobalBay and PAYware Mobile to more than double in 2013 to over $40 million.
Now let's turn to international revenue.
In a nutshell continental Europe was flat despite product issues now being -- now having been solved in Germany and to be solved in France by the second half of the year.
There remains a challenging environment due to lingering macroeconomic difficulties.
Point continues to do very well.
Asia had a strong quarter as their rebound continued.
And Latin America was impacted as we planned from the fire this summer.
Latin America revenues declined 24% year-over-year both as reported and organically.
On an organic constant currency basis revenues declined 17% compared to the blowout Q4 of a year ago.
We are pleased with this quarter's Latin America results because as you recall we guided to Q4 revenues between $65 million and $75 million.
But we were able to exceed these numbers with some excellent executions and sales wins.
I'm excited to announce today that we've expanded our relationship with Brazil's Redecard by entering into an agreement to become a long-term provider of logistics services including installation of our systems and repair of our systems and those of our competitors.
The impact of the summer fire is now fully behind us and we expect a strong Q1 in Latin America.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues grew 36% over Q4 last year and 1% organically.
Organic growth was 6% on a constant currency basis.
A couple of factors suppressed the Q4 EMEA growth rate.
We had tough comparisons for Russia and Turkey where sales had reached record levels a year ago.
As I mentioned last quarter in France we are awaiting government and bank certification for a VeriFone system with new software to supply the small and medium business market.
We still expect the product to be available by the second half of FY '13.
Our sales into the Middle East and Africa remained strong.
We saw record revenues in our South Africa operation with our VX evolution range of products now being the system of choice for First National Bank and Standard Bank.
We enjoyed good volumes of orders from Egypt again during Q4.
We view North Africa as a big opportunity for FY '13 and we continue to supply systems as part of the Central Bank of Nigeria's program to convert Lagos into an electronic payment society and are working with the local banks there to identify future opportunities in neighboring cities and towns.
In Germany our new H5000 product shipped in material volume during October and was well received.
We expect to see a steady ramp-up of sales over the next few quarters.
In the U.K.
we enjoyed retail wins at Iceland Card Factory Halfords and the Body Shop.
Point revenues were $58 million in Q4.
We continued to see outstanding progress in transforming to payment-as-a-service in the Point region.
The installed base of the all-in-one systems grew 24% compared to Q4 '11.
As a reminder the all-in-one business which bundles systems in a suite of software and services into a multi-year contract increases overall revenue significantly over the life of the contract but defers revenue over many quarters rather than generating an immediate benefit.
Moving on to Asia.
We are extremely happy with the results in the fourth quarter.
Revenues were up 32% from a year ago and 32% organically.
Growth was 35% on an organic constant currency basis.
With the exception of India we saw strong year-over-year growth across the region.
In China year-over-year revenue growth was 70% with great wins at Tier 1 banks and UMS the largest China UnionPay ISO.
Greater Asia achieved a record quarter with strong sales in Thailand Malaysia the Philippines Singapore and Indonesia.
We enjoyed great wins at the Bank of Mandiri in Indonesia and BAY one of Thailand's largest banks.
In Australia we saw 64% year-over-year revenue growth due to an accelerated rollout with Woolworths and a great win at National Australia Bank.
We made progress in our payment-as-a-service model exemplified by a win at McDonald's and remain focused on growing that business.
As I mentioned last quarter demand in India has been impacted by the Reserve Bank of India's directive to reduce and cap merchant discount rate for debit transactions to a level half of the current average and below the interchange rate set by MasterCard and Visa.
The announcement has caused acquirers to slow down on system deployments until further clarity is attained.
Before turning the call over to Bob I'd like to discuss our strategic plans for 2013.
Over the past 2 years we have invested aggressively in our U.S.
business to incubate VeriFone's next generation of solutions to accelerate growth.
We bought a $5 million tablet-based [ph] software business and will likely grow mobility into a $40 million plus business in fiscal 2013.
We invested significantly in taxi systems and media systems infrastructure and have now built $100 million services business there.
We are revolutionizing the way convenience stores and petroleum retailers engage with their clients through pump-based advertising and couponing and in-store targeted promotions.
All 3 of these new business lines are fast-growing businesses which are accelerating our new -- our North American growth rates and were evidenced in Q4.
Our goal for 2013 is to step up R&amp;D and channel investments to clone our GlobalBay taxi LIFT Retail and Point businesses for deployment in several other key international markets where we have an expandable infrastructure a strong and established brand and solid macro growth fundamentals.
Some of these business expansions include: a taxi and media business in São Paulo where we have already signed 500 cabs and are beginning deployment.
Note Brazil will be hosting the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016; GlobalBay in Mexico where we have recently signed Sanborns stores in Mexico City and Xcaret theme park in Cancun; expansion of Point with H&amp;M in Mexico and Arcos Dorados in Argentina; expansion of Point in Australia and New Zealand where the complexity of EMV and compliance is creating a substantial opportunity similar to Northern Europe; new taxi business in Warsaw Poland where we have 750 cabs now signed and installed; finally GlobalBay products released to selected retailers in Point's markets throughout Europe and in Asia.
The aggregate cost of these investments is approximately $4 million in operating expense per quarter.
We expect to see the fruits of our labor beginning in the second half of 2013 and a material positive impact on growth rates and margins in 2014.
All of these initiatives are being rolled out as managed services and towards our goal of transforming our business model.
We believe we can repeat the success we have seen in North America throughout all of VeriFone.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob to discuss in more detail the P&amp;L balance sheet cash flows and guidance.
Thanks Doug.
I'd like to start by spending some time discussing fourth quarter revenues compared to the guidance we provided in our September 1 earnings release.
At $489 million in revenues we were $6 million under the $495 million low end of the guidance range.
As Doug mentioned Latin America outperformed expectations because of excellent execution and some sales wins particularly in Brazil.
Our weaker market was primarily EMEA.
In Turkey a new government regulation requiring certification of wireless devices has stalled the whole market.
We believe we will adjust and turn this challenge into an opportunity.
The H5000 product in Germany ramped slower than we expected in Q4 as it needed to be approved by each network service provider but it is now fully certified and selling well in Q1.
Poland fell short of expectations as Visa downshifted its campaign called the Big Idea which aimed to encourage contactless system [ph].
In the Middle East a few sales deals were deferred to Q1 because of timing of customers’ signing delivery of letters of credit.
Each of these 4 factors represented about $3 million to $5 million in revenue.
As we did last quarter we are providing a calculation of organic revenue growth both as reported and at constant currency.
We have adjusted non-U.S.
dollar revenue for 2012 using FX rates from the same period a year earlier.
Total organic revenue grew 4% and 8% on a constant currency basis.
North America grew 22% organically.
Internationally organic revenues declined 3% but grew 2% on a constant currency basis.
Non-GAAP gross margins came in at 44.2% a slight decrease of 1.2 percentage points from our record third quarter levels but well ahead of levels from a year ago.
System solutions gross margins declined by 2.1 points driven primarily by customer and geographic mix.
Services gross margins improved by 0.6 points.
The sequential improvement of service's gross margins primarily reflects increased services revenue with a favorable mix towards service offerings that provide us with higher incremental margins such as Point and other managed service offerings.
Compared to the prior quarter non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by $6.6 million to $105.1 million.
This decrease primarily reflects the disinvestment in the direct to micro-merchant SAIL business and lower variable compensation expense.
Non-GAAP net interest and other expense decreased sequentially by $1.7 million primarily from our continued deleveraging.
For non-GAAP purposes we have excluded the revenue and expenses of the direct to micro-merchant SAIL business that has been divested.
GAAP requires a firm agreement with a buyer in order to qualify for discontinued operation accounting treatment but as we are close to such an agreement we believe the best way to reflect VeriFone's ongoing operations is to exclude the results of the business to be divested.
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet.
Our cash balance at the end of Q4 grew $44 million from the prior quarter to $454 million.
Also on the balance sheet accounts receivable days sales outstanding was down by 1 day to 70 days.
Inventory increased by $13 million and inventory measured as days of supply increased by 2 days to 57 days.
Accounts payable increased $9 million and days payable increased from 61 days to 64 days.
In Q4 we expanded our debt facility by $185 million with 3 lenders already in our credit group and 3 new banks willing to lend additional low-cost Term A and revolver funds because of a strong credit profile.
We've used $130 million of that to prepay the more expensive Term B debt and now have over $200 million of undrawn revolver providing additional liquidity.
In the fourth quarter cash flow from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities was down $72 million -- sorry was $72 million.
Cash flow from operations was $73 million and free cash flow was $54 million.
We invested $10 million in revenue-generating assets most of which was for Point systems.
I'd like to emphasize that while we closely monitor and understand the importance of free cash flow we believe that non-GAAP earnings are a better barometer of the performance of the company.
Free cash flow can be volatile or skewed in ways that will cause it to give a distorted view of the true business performance.
First free cash flow can be swayed by irregular cash outflows such as restructuring payments or by irregular cash inflows from windfalls such as the sale of our claim on Lehman's estate.
Second working capital as we've seen can fluctuate significantly from simply the timing of customer payments or our payments to vendors.
Fluctuating working capital can cause free cash flow volatility even when a business is quite stable.
Finally when a company sees high-return opportunities and makes the capital expenditures to profit from those opportunities this suppresses free cash flow.
But does that mean the business is doing poorly? We believe the heightened investments and revenue-generating assets such as Point systems Secure PumpPAY systems the media and digital taxi systems will pay off with higher returns and thus reward investors for years to come.
Again cash flow is very important to us and we always seek to optimize it.
But we use non-GAAP earnings to understand how our business is truly performing not free cash flow.
There are important reasons as to why everyone uses accrual-based accounting and not cash-based accounting to measure their operations.
Nevertheless we are continuing to forecast strong free cash flow in fiscal 2013 as I will now explain.
Now let's look forward to the first quarter of fiscal '13.
Our guidance for Q1 is for non-GAAP revenue to be between $490 million and $500 million assuming current exchange rates.
We expect our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.73.
For fiscal '13 we are confirming our guidance for non-GAAP revenue of $2.05 billion to $2.1 billion and EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.30.
For fiscal '13 we expect capital expenditures to range from $80 million to $100 million.
A majority of this amount will be for revenue-generating assets.
We expect free cash flow that is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures to range from $285 million to $315 million.
Working capital has and probably will continue to fluctuate materially quarter-to-quarter so this represents somewhat of a wild card in the free cash flow equation.
I will now turn it over to Doug Bergeron for some concluding remarks.
Thanks Bob.
I'd like to elaborate on Bob's guidance.
We see single-digit growth in Latin America following 2 years of nearly 40% average growth.
We see a relatively flat business in Europe with exceptions positive exceptions in Germany due to new products Russia Africa and of course Point.
We see 10% to 20% growth in Asia due largely to accelerating prospects in Australia and China.
And we see 10% to 15 growth in North America driven by strong EMV-led sales in Tier 1 retail good growth in hospitality and in petroleum and a doubling of our sales of tablet-based payment software and services.
All together this represents total growth of 9% to 11% or $2.05 billion to $2.1 billion.
We will see higher R&amp;D and channel investments than in previous years in order to set up our international markets for rapid Point GlobalBay and taxi revenue growth in the second half of 2013 and 2014.
As we complete fiscal year 2012 we have accomplished a great amount.
Our full year organic revenue growth was 14% on a constant currency basis.
Operating margins were at an all-time high percentage.
We generated outstanding bottom line growth of 43% for our shareholders.
But we have not sacrificed strategic investments for the sake of the bottom line.
The past year featured the acquisition of Point and its highly successful payment-as-a-service model that we are using a blueprint for providing compressive payment solutions to retailers around the world.
Also in 2012 we cemented our position as the leading provider of mobile payment technology with GlobalBay retailing applications robust and highly secure payment sleeves for mobile devices and strategic partnerships with the new mobile wallet sponsors PayPal Google and Isis and retail systems providers Oracle and Fujitsu.
The foundations built in 2012 will drive continued outsized returns for our shareholders in 2013 and beyond.
Looking forward to 2013 we expect another strong year of revenue earnings and cash flow growth and continued success with our software and services initiatives.
Thank you for listening and we will now open up the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Just the first question if we normalize Brazil and added about maybe $10 million to $15 million to revenue in the quarter you would have shown top line organic growth rate a little over 10%.
First of all is that $10 million to $15 million about right in thinking about more normal run rate given what you have I think said in the past for the first quarter about 90 95? And then secondly how do you -- how much do you estimate your revenue growth and free cash flow generation is actually being impacted by the conversion in your model to a more recurring revenue approach? In Brazil we said in the past it represents a little more than half of our typical Latin American business.
And the business is very ratable.
So your numbers of $10 million to $15 million per month in Brazil are not far off.
I would confirm that.
And we suffered a difficult month in August as you know Darrin.
With respect -- I'll let Bob comment as well later.
With respect to the longer-term services businesses yes.
I mean I can give you countless examples of the unintended but necessary consequences of us turning product sales into integrated services sales not just at Point but in various regions in the company where we're not getting the juice of the onetime product hit.
Long term that's great for the business.
It's great for profits and it's great for margins.
So we're going to continue to do it.
Research Division</strong> All right.
So then basically I don't know we don't know exactly what the number would have been or would be in the next year or so in terms of what it would grow if you weren't going through this conversion.
Is it a couple of hundred basis points higher in the top line? And then I'm assuming this also is pretty contributory to your margins.
I mean can you just give us a little more granularity on both of those numbers if you know them at least? I don't have it and I wouldn't want to mislead you.
We know it's real taking deferred revenue versus onetime revenue impacts short-term revenue.
But we know from looking at the before and after from Point internally they had tremendous margins expansion.
And eventually you kind of catch up with the deferral of the revenue and you resume your growth rate.
Research Division</strong> Right.
Okay.
Just a quick question on North America growth.
Again a pretty good quarter better than I think we expected at least.
And then most of it you're saying it sounds at least like is multilane.
How long is that going to last? I mean is this another upgrade because of anticipation for EMV? I mean -- or is it mostly market share gains like the Target deal you announced? And then are there further market share gains like that? Is there more disruption from the divestiture of the Hypercom assets than maybe you even expected? I don't know.
I mean this is a sticky business.
Customers come up for renewal every 4 5 years.
And I would say we're in a very good position when they do to take that business.
We are the de facto standard through the industry in Tier 1 Tier 2 retail.
Sometimes I'll go a whole weekend without finding an alternative to VeriFone in Tier 1 Tier 2.
But to get somebody to change early I doubt it.
But to your question on the sustainability of the multilane model in fact our North American model yes we feel very good for several years ahead that the combination of EMV the widening of the market that EMV is causing introducing opportunities in hospitality pay-at-the-table the tablet-based solutions which I think will be a double for a while all contribute to probably the most confident position we've had around our North American business in many years.
Research Division</strong> All right.
And just last question for me and I'll go back to the queue.
But from a competitive standpoint obviously we all get a lot of questions over different types of technologies.
And GlobalBay you mentioned is growing extremely well.
That sounds -- that's great for now but is it just because it's early days and it's a small base and it's basically one of a few competitors? Or how competitive is the landscape for tablet-based acceptance of the POS? And what is your differentiation there that gives you the confidence that you can keep growing in that market like you've traditionally been able to grow in a more consolidated market like the traditional terminals? Well I alluded to it in the script.
Most retailers are not -- most large national retailers don't have 50 people running around experimenting with mobile point-of-sale technology.
So they have to look to a trusted partner someone that's worked with them for many years for advice.
So I think our brand our incumbency and the fact that we have these solutions gives us an unbelievable advantage over 2 guys in a bathtub putting stuff together.
As you've seen with Fujitsu and Oracle everybody even deals that we might not win on the software side needs security.
They need EMV.
They might want NFC and they want PCI compliance.
And we solve that problem with them by providing the encryption sleeves.
So I think we're in a very good competitive position throughout the U.S.
And we're seeing unbelievable interest by our customers outside of the U.S.
And that's why we're going to make these investments to build up that capability in some of the fast-growing markets outside the U.S.
where we think we can be very successful.
Your next question is coming from the line of Andrew Jeffrey SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> So a couple of things.
Just reflecting a little bit on the decision to exit the direct sale pay business.
Doug can you talk a little bit about what that might mean for a potential future partnership with Square or one of the other disruptive players out there and how VeriFone is positioned for that? And then also are we seeing any knock-on effects in SME from the disruptors like Square? SME has been a -- it was a tough year for you in North America and SME.
It sounds like maybe the U.S.
got a little bit better in the quarter.
But are there any effects on that traditional terminal business that you're seeing as a result of dominance? The decision to exit the acquiring side of the micro-merchant market is -- was really one that I would hope our investors would applaud.
We should have always gone into that market to find out what was there.
And as soon as we found out that it was a negatively -- it was in our estimate a permanently negative margin business for acquiring only we ran out of it.
We do you think that there'll be players there that potentially could make money on a loss-leading basis by selling other things.
We're not equipped to sell other things to micro-merchants.
So it makes perfect sense.
But our sale initiative let's be clear is continuing.
We're partnering with banks and acquirers all over the world now to use our gateway and rent our services and let them go out and find these merchants.
I think there is some wisdom in bringing micro-merchants into the acquiring market.
I just don't want to be the guy running risk management spending money on television finding them and then having to bill them for these micro-transactions.
But so -- we're -- I think we're doing the right thing here.
Does the SME market get impacted by dongles? Certainly dongles on phones really I think there's no impact.
These are folks and bake sales and as I've said before dog walkers weren't accepting payments in the past.
So it's not cannibalistic.
A dongle on a tablet potentially I haven't seen many of them.
But anybody that's sophisticated enough that wants to accept debit is worried about security.
Wants EMV ultimately ends up in a sleeve sale for us which interestingly is higher priced and higher margin than it's cannibalized payment terminal.
So far we have -- we've seen very little of this I think in the U.S.
and 0 of it outside of the U.S.
because it's an EMV world out there.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And with regard to Europe it sounds like there were a number of puts and takes maybe more of the former than the latter.
But can you address the competitive environment between Ingenico and VeriFone? It sounds like there've been some Hypercom-specific disruptions.
It doesn't sound like they're any worse this quarter or necessarily any better.
How do we get comfort with acceleration in Europe in the back half outside of Point and other payment-as-a-service initiatives? So the areas in Europe that I said have been performing well and we expect to continue to perform well are Africa and the Middle East Northern Europe including Point of course and Germany where the difficult times in 2012 were self-inflicted by the Hypercom product problem which has now been resolved and is shifting well.
I -- there's an overhang macro-economically throughout Europe that's a huge drag on demand ultimately.
You can imagine that large retailers are doing everything they can to stay in business but they're likely not opening many new stores.
So in 2012 due to the -- budgeted or planned revenue dis-synergy in several areas in -- particularly in the Balkans and in a couple other areas in Eastern Europe we lost revenue -- Hypercom revenue to Ingenico.
We have planned that.
Perhaps we lost a little more because of the product shortfalls in France and Germany.
But my sense Andrew is that rebalancing of whatever that was in revenue maybe we budgeted $40 million of revenue dis-synergy and it turned out to be $60 million.
I don't have these numbers and you'll never be able to figure out the number -- we'll never able to figure out exactly what they were.
Whatever was was.
And the new market share construct is what it is going forward.
Ingenico is a very good company.
We have tremendous respect for them.
They make good products and we make great products as well.
And we're both going to compete vigorously in almost every market in the world.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And what did you say I'm sorry about Asia revenue growth? I missed that.
And I'll jump back.
It was 30...
Inc.
Research Division</strong> No.
For '13? No.
32% -- for the -- going forward or...
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Yes yes going forward.
10% to 20%.
Next question is coming from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> Just on the multilane side Doug it sounds like some good names there Target Kroger.
I'm curious what the pricing looks like there.
And also during the sales effort what are they saying or telling you guys around mobile and EMV and NFC things like that? I mean obviously they're making these decisions ahead of some of this complexity just any kind of context there will be great.
Okay.
Pricing is good.
These top names want to deal with VeriFone because we're the finest company in America providing these types of solutions and services.
Increasingly the differentiator is encryption which you didn't ask about.
But I'll be pleased to brag about it at any time.
If you want encryption it unfairly biases your purchase decision around the VeriFone product set.
The MX 900 if you haven't seen it you should drop by the National Retail Federation trade show in New York in the beginning -- second week of January.
We've got some pretty cool stuff on display there.
It's a fantastic high-resolution touch-capacitive piece of technology that it just knocks the socks off of retailers when they see it.
Most of the Tier 1 retailers are now including in their requirements a chip card capability for purposes that you referenced in your question for future proofing the systems.
So all we have to do is provide EMV software somewhere -- someplace in the future.
And I think NFC continues to be a strong add-on in our international markets.
Forget what percentage of ship share but it was 25% 30%.
Perhaps I'll correct it by the end of the call if I'm wrong.
Whereas in the U.S.
it's been much less than that.
But we're seeing EMV certainly as a top of discussion item with major retailers.
Research Division</strong> So just to clarify Doug when you talk about encryption there are you talking about being the key manager in doing encryption services? Or something that's more embedded? For -- well both for PIN debit and for VeriShield Protect you need unique keys and keys after we rotate it.
So there's -- the fact that the VeriFone solutions are the solutions of choice that 9 out of -- 8 or 9 out of the top 11 processors now can decrypt their transactions it biases our product sales in our favor.
Research Division</strong> All right.
That's good to know.
Just 2 more.
Just on the system solutions side gross margins down a couple of hundred points there.
You mentioned mix.
Can you elaborate there? Because I thought North America margins had higher margins so I'm guessing maybe it's Brazil and some other areas from a mix standpoint.
There's also product mix and geographic mix.
It really bumps around Tien.
I would not read anything into that.
It goes up and down a couple hundred basis points.
Services margins are the ones that we said we'll continue to grow I think unidirectionally.
And as long as services margins are growing -- services revenue is growing faster than product revenue it will have a positive impact on average gross margins.
Research Division</strong> So really not expecting much in '13 in terms of change in margin from what we saw in 4Q? Product margins will stay around where they are 43% 44%.
I think systems margins should continue their incremental improvement throughout the year just because they're a high fixed cost low variable cost business.
As we pull out some of our infrastructure for taxi in some of these countries that may ironically be a little bit of a drag but don't read too much into this on services margin expansion.
But depending on how we -- depending on the accounting for some of these things it's hard to predict.
So I think services margins can continue to expand and that's why we're all over them [ph].
Research Division</strong> Yes that make sense for a compounding standpoint.
Last one just quickly.
Just a couple of quarters here revenue coming in below guidance.
Has visibility sort of just changed in the business given everything that's going on? Or is there something else? And has it changed your sort of philosophy in how you want to guide short term? Yes I mean one thing it has changed is when we were doing $200 million a quarter and 80% products 85% products to guide within $5 million when you're -- even though we're doing 69% products this quarter when you're doing near $500 million a quarter $5 million is just too narrow of a can to aim for.
So we've raised our range to $10 million.
That's one thing.
Hey listen the world economy is not doing great right now.
We fight for the attention of our retail and acquiring customers.
And we're -- luckily we've got our eggs in some good baskets.
But it's not the rosiest world out there and it is what it is.
And we gave guidance the first week of September.
I personally feel several geographies especially in Europe have deteriorated since then at a macro level not so much from a payments level.
Your next question is coming from the line of John T.
Williams UBS.
Research Division</strong> A couple of quick questions.
First on the CapEx guidance.
It looks like it's a bit lower than it was.
Just wanted to hear and forgive me if I missed it what accounts for the difference in your thinking from a few months back versus now on CapEx for '13.
Well we're just -- I mean it's the 3 things -- 3 categories that Bob alluded to: Point the primary one; taxi expansion and Secure PumpPAY; and also some next-generation digital tops for a couple of key markets.
No it's just because we're closer to -- we're in 2013 now whereas 3 or 4 months ago we were still in the budgeting process.
So it's just a more refined answer.
We've been be able to bottoms up the numbers in a more granular way.
So we give you the numbers as we know them and that's what the numbers are now not the wider number that you had before.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So there weren't any moving parts that moved around much more than you thought? This is just a we're here now versus not being there 3 months ago sort of situation? Yes I mean there's no -- none of those 3 strategic areas have become less strategic.
We just -- we can count dollars better because it's more contemporary than it was 3 months ago.
Research Division</strong> Okay fair enough.
My second question Doug it's more of a strategic one.
It seems that people are really worried that mobile POS systems with what are perceived as a lot lower ASPs are going to drive down your pricing.
But I think they often overlook the fact that retailers need just more units when they go down that route.
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the dynamic there because I think it would be helpful if you explain to people that it's not replacing that one $400 terminal with one $100 terminal.
It might be replacing one of them with 3 or 4.
Exactly.
Not only that it's replacing a 400 with a 500 and then buying more of them.
And then of course we regularly have the opportunities to sell the software and that software that we're selling is highly integrated.
So it's a significant enterprise software sale.
So we get not only more hardware units we get more hardware pricing and we get the substantial enterprise software opportunities.
So it's really changing the dynamics.
Yes I mean we see for instance that one famous department store which is in the middle of a transformation right now a significant increase in the total spend with VeriFone as they've moved from purely traditional checkout to in-store retail because all of these same folks that spent millions of dollars over the years on PCI compliance and the ability to accept PIN debit aren't going to give that away or sully that in any way with mobility.
So that drives the need for sleeves for tablets PIN capability for tablets which has to be done outside of the tablet hardware and as Bob said software and more units in the store mapped to the number of clerks versus the number of checkouts stands.
So we see this as a tremendous expansion of our total addressable market over time.
Research Division</strong> Doug how does it affect -- as you get closer and closer to having this be a decent contributor to your mix? How does this affect the upgrade cycle? I know you talk about 3 to 5 years sometimes.
But I would presume that just given that people are going to drop these things over and over that they'd be much shorter.
How do you see that affecting you over the next couple of years? Is that fair to say that it would be much shorter? I disagree in that if they're dropped it probably wrecks the iPad or the tablet.
But likely the ruggedized sleeve which we provide will still be working.
We're not in the glass business if you will.
But they will get misplaced and they'll leave the store from time to time.
And just as in all of our wireless terminal business we see a higher replacement cycle.
I would expect there's some of that.
But I wouldn't -- I think your first question as to -- your first observation as to the increase in the number of units per store is probably more meaningful than the shorter life cycle.
Next question is coming from the line of Julio Quinteros Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> A couple of quick ones.
DSO target embedded in the cash flow guidance for the year.
Bob can you help us walk through a little bit of thought on where you think the DSOs can go from here? I think we're still sitting around that $70 -- 70-day range? Well I don't think that you should look at receivables payables and inventory separately from each other.
The fact is they're all interlinked.
So rather than saying that there is a particular DSO assumption you can see that that guidance does have us continue to increase our working capital.
And [indiscernible] that's the way to do it.
It depends upon how revenue occurs at the beginning of one quarter end of the quarter et cetera.
It changes the dynamics between those 3 elements but they're all a function of each other.
So I'd just model the whole thing together on sales increasing [ph].
Research Division</strong> Okay.
All right.
We can work through that.
Secondly when you guys were talking about the small and medium end market segment I guess I wanted to sort of parse sort of 2 separate thoughts: one the competitive dynamics that could conceivably be providing you with some more competition but the other one is just the cyclicality of where the SMEs are today given the lack of new business formation and lower overall growth in the SMB market segment.
How much is that affecting you guys relative to the competitive dynamics if you will? There's one more.
It's we served that market historically through channels like First Data and others who have all been under tremendous pressure to reduce inventory and reduce their own working capital.
So it's hard for us to know what's the -- what's the complexion of these multiple headwinds.
Is it new business formation which hopefully maybe can start to recover a little bit in the new year if we get past the fiscal cliff and this confidence crisis we have? Or is it inventory levels which we know because we require them to tell us where their inventories are are at all-time lows or multiyear lows? Or is it the dongle guys? For the life of me I spend all my time when I'm outside the office sticking my head into stores to see how VeriFone's doing.
And I haven't seen but for a few dongles out there.
So I don't think that's been a contributor.
So I think it's the other factor.
And we do believe there's probably a market shift going on between our major competitors.
In that market we're the dominant supplier.
But these...
Legally dominant supplier.
Yes legally dominant.
But there will always be a second supplier in that market and we think that the dynamics of that second supplier is probably changing from the remnants of Hypercom over to another competitor.
But we think that that's not affecting our market share.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just last for us on the competition front as it relates to Ingenico.
There was a question about pricing I think relative to Ingenico.
I guess I was wondering also if you can sort of delve a little bit into one of the other Chinese manufacturers that is clearly talking about price and price competition in the U.S.
Are you guys seeing those guys emerge? Is it a competitive issue? And how do we sort of think about another competitor here from China that could put some pricing pressure on the marketplace overall? That competitor that you're alluding to has been here for 5 years and haven't sold more than a couple terminals.
It's way more than the price of the product.
It's your services capability.
It's your access to digital wallets.
It's your commitment for software upgrades.
It's your EMV compliance.
It's your PCI compliance.
It's the guy that you know and trust.
And if it's just done -- if this is an electronics business we would have been out of it a long time ago.
This is a solutions business and customers make the decisions around a whole long list of requirements many of them services based and software based.
So there's been no impact from any Chinese competitors in the U.S.
market.
There has been in China however and we've talked about that at length before.
Your next question is coming from the line of Wayne Johnson Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just a couple of quick questions here.
Most of mine have been addressed.
But if I just look on the reported revenue line system solutions by far the dominant contributor to the Q that was above our plan.
And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the organic revenue growth outlook for POS in particular and how we should think about that going forward.
And then I have a follow-up.
I mean we went to great lengths to not only provide Wayne organic revenue projections.
We even gave you organic guidance per region.
I think you see...
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Right but I'm parsing out -- I apologize for interrupting your answer.
I'm trying to parse out the service from the hardware on a geographic basis.
The bulk of what we were talking about when we gave those growth rates is really a reflection of POS-type business.
Clearly we've included in that the fact that there will be some -- a weakening of  the straight POS business as we move to the services business with the Point model et cetera.
But we don't want to literally break it out because we're still evolving in those other markets.
And so I think it's better just to stick with the total growth by business -- by the geographic area and know that if all things were equal if we weren't trying to grow our Point business the POS business will grow a bit stronger than that.
But we have included in there a bit of a weakness in the POS business as we grow the service...
Well it's a weakness in reported revenues from systems it's not a weakness in customer attachment which comes vis-à-vis the services contracts.
That's what I'm trying to say.
It's a lower growth than in other ways it would have been.
And we reflected that in those numbers.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I appreciate that response.
And again just looking out for 2013 at least in the fourth quarter G&amp;A was less than we were looking for.
How should we think -- you mentioned about an increase in R&amp;D potential increase I think in sales and marketing.
How should we think about G&amp;A going forward as a percentage of sales? Well we -- Q4 was a bit aberrational because we had turns out over-accrued for some incentive compensation which got reversed out.
So I would look at Q3 run rates and then add in -- for the most part and then add in this $4 million.
And that should get you kind of to where you need to go.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay that's helpful.
And I'll take the rest of my questions offline.
And Wayne that may be plus or minus 1 million 2 million or 3 million.
I'm ballparking this for you.
Yes I mean you should look at the revenue guidance and EPS guidance we gave you.
It's been our guidance and everything else fits in between.
Next question is coming from the line of Phil Stiller Citi.
Research Division</strong> I just wanted to follow up on Latin America.
I think you guys talked about low single-digit organic growth in that region for next year.
I know you faced some tough comps early in the year.
But obviously the comp in the fourth quarter will be pretty easy.
So I mean overall has your view on that market changed from the ongoing growth can it continue to be a double-digit grower as we get past next year? My opinion on the market has not changed.
It's a very vibrant market.
I didn't say low single digits.
I said single digits.
In fact in one edit of the script I even had high single digits and I chopped it out because I didn't want to overpromise.
No you can't grow a business a products business 40% year-over-year for 2 years and start to decelerate.
I think we've been warning about that for about 3 quarters.
My guess is as we become more services oriented in Latin America and we're moving -- you heard about some of our Point initiatives in Argentina in Mexico as we start to benefit from the GlobalBay sales in Latin America.
We've already had some really high-profile wins in Mexico and in Brazil.
Latin America in 2014 can be back to double digits.
But we need to do the work do the groundwork this year to set up these business expansion drivers for the future.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
I guess following up on that you talked about some GlobalBay wins there.
And you also talked earlier about the hardware prices being higher than your traditional business and more revenue -- more solutions per store.
So my understanding was that the typical investment by a merchant down there was lower than it is in North America and Europe.
So how were those customers in emerging markets reacting to the prices of the GlobalBay solutions and tablet offerings in general? It's too early to give you -- I mean we might have had 30 customer presentations and we might be in a dozen trials and we've had a few like less than one handful of major wins.
It's way too early to be able to summarize any elasticity of pricing kind of response.
But it will be a great question 6 months from now when I have more data.
Research Division</strong> All right.
I'll be sure to ask that in a couple of quarters...
I'm sure you will.
Research Division</strong> And last question.
You guys are continuing to guide to around $300 million in free cash flow for next year.
Just wondering if you can update us on what you're potential uses for that cash are.
It's still being discussed internally.
We haven't made any decisions.
There's possibility perhaps of a stock buyback.
We want to I guess see this fiscal cliff get behind us.
It's kind of nerve-wracking.
Our board and management are kind of in cash-hoarding mode right now with all of the sirens we see out there.
But if we can get through that and have a bright light forward there is a possibility of using some of not only our free cash flow but our expanded borrowing capacity.
But we've made no decisions as of this point.
And you and everybody else would be informed at the same time if we do.
At this time ladies and gentlemen I would like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Doug Bergeron for any closing remarks.
Well that's it.
Thanks everyone and for your patience.
We've migrated to fairly long conference calls.
I think it's necessary because of the complexity of the business that we developed as part of this transformation.
And we thank you for your patience and listening to all of that and understanding the business.
We're going to get back to work and hopefully deliver you a strong 2013.
Bye-bye.
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference.
We thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a great day.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 VeriFone Systems Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Derrick and I'll be your operator for today.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Bergeron CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and good afternoon everyone.
For the first fiscal quarter we reported revenue of $430 million non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 GAAP EPS of $0.11 and cash flow from operations was $53 million.
I want to use our time today to discuss the challenges we faced during our first quarter details of our underperformance and most importantly what we're doing to aggressively address the issues going forward.
On a summary level we felt the impact of both external headwinds and internal challenges.
The external headwinds were: impact of weaker-than-anticipated macroeconomic conditions in Europe; delayed customer tenders and spending particularly in Asia; currency controls in Venezuela; and the canceled Washington D.C.
taxi contract.
Internal challenges included delayed product customizations and certifications and sales execution missteps.
Let me begin with the details around each of the external challenges that were a factor in our revenue shortfall.
First Europe.
Heading into the quarter we were starting to become of a mind that the worst was over for Europe.
With new products now shipping in Germany we believe that the region would experience modest sequential growth.
It did not.
In fact we saw some of the softest European economies trend towards recession.
While there are certain European countries that are performing at or above plan for us on balance we expect overall demand in Europe to continue to be challenged throughout the rest of fiscal 2013.
Second several product tenders and requests for proposals forecasted for the quarter were delayed or canceled by customers especially in Asia.
In India for example anticipated sales were impacted by the Reserve Bank of India's directive to reduce and cap the merchant discount rate for debit transactions.
This announcement has caused acquirers to slowdown on systems deployments until further clarity is attained.
One of our larger Indian customers also implemented a capital freeze during the quarter.
Third we experienced a shortfall of approximately $5 million due to currency controls in Venezuela typically a very good market for VeriFone.
And finally the city of Washington D.C.
canceled our 5-year $35 million to $45 million taxi in-payment project after our competitors challenged the city's RFP process.
This project was assumed in our forecast for the quarter and for the year.
We are pursuing all of our legal remedies available under the binding contract with the city.
As we await resolution we are continuing to compete in the market by selling our superior solutions to individual taxi fleets.
Although external headwinds are difficult to predict we can and will do a better job of monitoring planning and mitigating their impact.
Let me now turn to the internal execution challenges that we faced in the quarter.
Over the past 30 days VeriFone Board of Directors our management team and I have initiated an exhaustive deep-dive evaluation of our business and its operations.
In retrospect we found that a number of our issues in the quarter and in the last few quarters were indeed soft-inflicted.
First we did not allocate sufficient resources to product localization and customization which has temporarily impacted our product leadership in several markets.
Let me explain the nature of our research and development investment which totaled $139 million in fiscal year 2012.
VeriFone spends approximately 40% of these dollars on platform development such as our latest generation the MX 900 Series.
This consisted of spending on the fundamental product design operating system design and security.
This also includes support and maintenance of previous generations of products that our customers continue to depend on.
And within this core platform investment we have also funded a generous ongoing development effort around the products of the future.
We continue to receive industry-wide accolades that the VeriFone product platform is the industry's superior most forward-looking architecture.
The second area of development spend is around gateway development software applications systems for managed services and all of the necessary ingredients of our successful services transformation.
We invested approximately 20% of our R&amp;D dollars last year on these initiatives and we are seeing great returns.
The final and not so well-known area of spending involves the localization and customization of our products for in-country specifications.
No 2 countries are alike.
This involves spending on local applications local bank interfaces government-imposed country-specific modifications security technologies customized for specific market requirements amongst other things and the certification of each new iteration.
VeriFone spends approximately 40% of our R&amp;D dollars on this effort which is widely distributed across the world and involves over 700 employees in over 40 countries.
Over the past 2 years the volume of these country-specific requirements has grown enormously.
In retrospect we weren't hiring fast enough and allocating enough resources to keep our first-to-market position with a few of our products in a handful of markets.
It is the multitude of these requirements that in fact constitutes some of the barriers-to-entry around our business model.
In retrospect we had a breakdown in the process that estimates these aggregate requirements and the field communication and prioritization of their needs.
Recently we took 2 major steps to remedy this issue.
First we redirected all field-based engineering staff to report centrally to our EVP of Worldwide Operations.
No longer do these resources report into the local [indiscernible].
This will allow for better process control more "code sharing " efficiencies and time savings and in summary a faster better output of software and deliverables.
Second effective this quarter we will begin ramping up our investment in R&amp;D to accelerate product customization and localization.
We're not just catching up on product development but we're moving ahead of the curve anticipating the market's escalating technology requirements.
This in fact reinforces what we've been saying for many years that the complexity around the point-of-sale in EMV countries in particular is increasing dramatically.
The market is certainly not dumbing down to dongles.
It's demanding ever-higher levels of sophisticated and secure technology localized customized and certified.
This is a technology arms race and only 2 rivals have the global scale to stay at the forefront.
In addition we had sales -- we had issues of sales execution.
First the Middle East and Africa is an important region of growth for us.
And during the quarter we adjusted the mix of our distributors whose mandate is continued expansion into some of the emerging economies in the Middle East and further into Sub-Saharan Africa.
As it turned out certain sales to these distributors did not meet the criteria of our customer credit policy by quarter end.
And therefore we deferred the revenue on these sales approximately $23 million.
In retrospect this can only be attributed to poor sales planning and execution.
Second we were impacted by our sometimes obsessive goals around transformation to a services-based business model.
The services-based solutions sale which means a multiyear contract with a customer combining systems and services involves the deferring of revenue from the embedded product component over the life of the contract but at a dramatically improved profitability of sometimes 2x to 2.5x the product sale.
Compensation plans have been tuned to drive this behavior.
And when a VeriFone employee wakes up in the morning he or she thinks about how to help a customer with a complex basket of premium service and products not just a product sale.
As a result many customers have started discussions with us around structuring longer-term services agreements which is sometimes causing a pushout of immediate revenue.
Increased attention to multiyear services initiatives also caused us to lose focus sometimes on near-term sales and product development execution.
Moving forward it is our job to ensure that this services transformation is better balanced and better executed.
Focus on the development customization and sale of our world-class product portfolio will no longer be sacrificed for long-term services goals.
In fact it is our very product excellence that gives us the inherent right to be the software and services provider for our customers.
The internal execution challenges which I've detailed for you are issues that can be solved in a matter of months not years.
We have taken aggressive steps to make this happen again consisting of centralizing field-based engineering resources increasing investment in product customization and localization and improving sales execution in managing transitions to our business model and distributors.
As we complete our internal evaluation we will likely take additional steps including changes to senior management to ensure that we have the best executive team and the resources to execute our strategic plan.
Despite these challenges some things went well during the quarter.
The North American and Point businesses delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth.
We continue to make good progress on expanding our services business with wins of Standard Bank of South Africa China PnR and VF brands of the U.S.
which includes stores such as North Face Vans and Timberland.
Now with that as a backdrop I would like to provide some more details on our operational results for the first quarter.
We're very pleased with our North American business which had a strong quarter with sales up 11% compared to a year ago.
We saw strength across many of our U.S.
market segments as a result of our strong product portfolio.
Our multilane retail sales remained robust with 11% year-over-year growth driven by increasing demand for our new MX 900 systems.
Our North American petroleum revenue was up 10% compared to a year ago driven primarily by record sales of Topaz the latest generation of our high-end petroleum unit [ph] [indiscernible] systems used in 60 000 of 100 000 U.S.
gas stations.
Revenues in our North American small business sector were up 30% year-over-year with strong growth in both U.S.
sales and sales into Canada.
Turning to taxis.
For the past month taxi passengers have beta tested our new mobile wallet called VeriFone Way to Ride in New York City cabs.
With our app riders can load payment cards tip preferences and receipt delivery preferences on their phone and quickly prepay their fare with a single tap using advanced sound-based technology.
The tests have been very successful.
We expect a full public roll-out of this payments app for Apple and Android phones next month with electronic hailing functionality to follow.
We have begun integration with several leading app providers in the U.S.
to enable in-taxi payments acceptance and processing for trips hailed through their apps in New York City taxis.
Now let's turn to our international results where we faced a very challenging quarter.
Revenues in Latin America for the first quarter were $73 million down 27% year-over-year and down 21% on a constant currency basis.
Performance was against a tough comp as we achieved near-record revenues during Q1 of last year.
Approximately $5 million of the shortfall from guidance was due to currency controls in Venezuela typically a strong market for us.
The balance of our Latin American shortfall was from software localization issues for our systems and the deferral of revenue from bundled systems and services contracts both which I described earlier.
Moving on to Asia.
Q1 revenues were up 11% year-over-year and up 10% on an organic constant currency basis.
This year's Q1 benefited from a soft year-over-year comparison as the Chinese New Year holiday in 2012 fell in our first quarter.
Although we are pleased with our Asia results for Q1 we saw delays in China RFPs and continued slow sales in India.
As I discussed earlier India sales were adversely impacted by the directive by the Reserve Bank of India to reducing cap merchant discount rates as well as the capital freeze at one of our larger Indian customers.
In China we won a Managed Services contract with China PnR where we will provide a set of services to an installed base of over 150 000 systems by fiscal year 2014 [ph].
Overall we are pleased with the success of our payment-as-a-service model in Asia particularly in Australia and are excited about the opportunity to provide comprehensive payment solutions to retailers around the world.
In Australia the required gateways have now been set up in the Bank of Queensland that began a payment-as-a-service pilot with us in Q2.
In December we announced the acquisition of New Zealand-based ENZ and Sektor Payments.
ENZ is the largest point-of-sale provider in New Zealand directly serving more than 40 000 merchant customers and offering customers an end-to-end payment solution including card acceptance devices software services and processing.
We expect these acquisitions to close in late Q2 or early Q3.
Finally Europe the Middle East and Africa was our most challenging geography.
Revenues grew 9% year-over-year on an organic basis.
However revenue in this segment declined 13% from the first quarter of fiscal year '12.
The single largest cause of our unacceptable EMEA performance this quarter was the new mix of -- in distributors that I discussed earlier.
Delayed rollouts and macro challenges in parts of Western Europe were the other contributing factors.
Despite these challenges there were a number of bright spots in EMEA in Q1 that illustrate the best-in-class status of our product platform and architecture and services offerings.
In Germany sales of our new H5000 system launched in Q4 were strong as the product is being well-received in that market.
We secured a 3-year managed services contract with the Standard Bank of South Africa and we continue to be excited by our progress with our Point business.
Point revenue is $57 million including services revenue of $47 million which grew sequentially 3% and 17% on a year-over-year basis.
We continue to see outstanding progress in transforming to payment-as-a-service in the Point region.
The installed base of all-in-one systems grew 25% in the first full year since the acquisition closed.
All-in-one is Point's name for the multiyear contract combining systems and services.
In addition we made great progress with our Point e-commerce offerings signing 21 new midsized e-commerce deals in Finland and France during Q1.
Majority of these deals are multichannel cross-channel offerings delivered from our single multichannel platform.
Here are a couple of examples of this type -- of how these types of solutions are being offered.
An installment payment solution which enables the customer to make an in-store purchase with the credit card and then make 3 installment payments.
The installments are automatically executed on the agreed date.
Another solution allows a customer to reserve goods online with a payment card and later collect the goods at the merchant completing the payment with the same card in an unattended payment device equipped with VeriFone system.
I'm proud of the progress we have made on developing our services business.
Over the last several years and accelerated by our acquisition of Point in 2012 our operating strategy has been to progressively expand our revenue base from having a majority of onetime hardware sales to having multiyear solutions and services contracts.
By transforming the company to this revenue mix over the long term we believe that we will achieve higher overall revenue and margins and build deeper and more integrated relationships with our customers.
As a result this will allow us to create a more predictable recurring revenue stream that will provide us with greater visibility into our future opportunities.
So far we have seen the strategy work successfully in our Point business.
Point's performance in it's payment-as-a-service model is evidence of the value proposition created by a robust services offering and we are confident we can recreate this success on a broader scale across other regions.
That wraps my review up of the operational results for the quarter.
I now turn it over to Marc Rothman our new CFO who joined the company at the beginning February to provide the financial review.
Marc was previously CFO at Motorola Mobility and brings a wealth of valuable experience leading financial organizations as well as global business expertise.
Thanks Doug.
Good afternoon.
As you can imagine my first weeks at VeriFone have been very busy.
I'm very pleased to be on board and looking forward to helping Doug execute on our operational and financial plans.
Consistent with our historical practice we will be referring to income statement items on a non-GAAP basis.
For the first quarter revenues were $430 million a 1% increase over the previous year.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions over the past 12 months substantially all related to our Point business organic revenue declined 7%.
And on a constant currency basis the organic revenue decline was 6%.
As discussed earlier a significant part of our shortfall related to the deferral of sales in the Middle East and Africa region.
The decision to defer this revenue is consistent with the company's long-standing revenue recognition policy and requirements under GAAP and was not a change in accounting policy or practice.
In addition as is customary our conclusion was reviewed by our external auditors a normal course of their review of our quarterly results.
Operating margins for the quarter were 18% of revenue and non-GAAP fully diluted earnings for the quarter were $0.51 per share a decrease of $0.07 over Q1 of last year.
Turning now to our systems and service revenue and margin mix.
System solution revenues were $282 million in Q1 down 10% from the prior year.
Sales were down in EMEA and Latin America and were partially offset by improvements in North America and Asia.
Service revenues of $148 million was 34% of total revenue in Q1 [indiscernible] have increased steadily over the last 8 quarters.
Recurring services revenue such as payment-as-a-service and annual software maintenance increased several million dollars sequentially over Q4.
This increase was more than offset by a reduction in installation services and lower taxi advertising revenue primarily impacted by post-Olympics slowdown in the U.K.
Overall our gross margins were 43.6% a slight decrease of 60 basis points from our fourth quarter levels and up 70 basis points from a year ago.
In our system solutions business our gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 42.4% comparable sequentially and down slightly from a year ago.
Service gross margins were 45.7% a decrease of 250 basis points from our fiscal fourth quarter.
This sequential reduction in service gross margins primarily reflects the impact of our lower taxi advertising revenue and certain higher-margin Q4 sales not recurring in Q1.
Service gross margins were up year-over-year 230 basis points primarily due to the higher-margin Point business being included now for a full quarter in 2013.
Let me now move to discuss operating expenses.
Operating expenses at $109 million increased by $3.5 million sequentially.
Our combined R&amp;D and sales and marketing expenses were comparable to the prior quarter.
Our G&amp;A did increase $3.1 million primarily due to an increase in professional services and a favorable adjustment to variable comp in Q4.
Moving forward we expect our operating expenses to ramp up to approximately $120 million to $130 million per quarter reflecting the increased investments Doug discussed earlier in his commentary.
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet.
Our cash balance of $477 million grew $23 million from the prior quarter.
Our net debt is $815 million down $164 million from this time a year ago.
Our credit agreement requires us to meet 2 financial covenants.
There's a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
We are in compliance at the quarter end and expect based on all of our projections to remain compliant in the future.
Continuing with the balance sheet.
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were up 6 days to 74 days impacted substantially by the growth in deferred revenue.
Inventory increased by $11 million and inventory measured as days of supply increased to 68 days.
Accounts payable ended the quarter at $155 million a decrease of $38 million quarter-over-quarter.
Days payable outstanding for the quarter decreased to 57 days.
This decrease was driven primarily by the timing of invoices issued by our contract manufacturers such that a larger proportion was paid within the quarter relative to the last quarter.
Although working capital will fluctuate quarter-on-quarter we will have a renewed effort to improve each of our cash flow metrics going forward.
Now turning to cash flow.
In the first quarter of 2013 cash flow from operations was $53 million.
During the quarter we invested $20 million in capital including $10 million on revenue-generating assets mainly systems for point deployments.
Our free cash flow was $33 million for the quarter.
Now let's move -- look forward to the second quarter.
Consistent with our most recent update we expect non-GAAP revenue to be between $435 million to $450 million.
We expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.50.
For the full year our guidance for non-GAAP revenue is $1.8 billion to $1.83 billion earnings per share of $1.90 to $2.10 and free cash flow generation in the range of $170 million to $190 million.
Also from a directional perspective we expect that non-GAAP net revenue and non-GAAP net income per share will grow sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013.
I will now turn it back over to Doug Bergeron for his concluding remarks.
Thanks Marc.
Despite our short-term disappointment we do not believe that the first quarter shortfall reflects a fundamental weakening of either the global market for point-of-sale solutions or our longer-term competitive position in that market.
As we said earlier our problems will be addressed over a matter of months not years.
We operate in a growing industry with increasing complexity and a stable or improving margin profile.
Our main competitor has recently posted excellent results demonstrating that the opportunity for us to continue our decade-long success story remains unchanged and our incumbency at over 20 million payment locations across the world gives us an inherent advantage to be our customers' partner in providing enhanced EMV security and services-based solutions.
I've detailed for you the external headwinds and the internal product and sales execution challenges that hampered our Q1 results.
Today we are aggressively addressing those issues by centralizing engineering resources increasing focus in spending on local product development and improving our sales execution with our services offering and with our distributors.
As we complete our internal review we will also take the additional steps necessary to ensure that we have the right management team and resources to execute our strategic plan.
Moving forward the remainder of 2013 will be a rebuilding period for VeriFone as we accelerate investments in both product customizations and our services offerings.
But we expect to enter fiscal 2014 in less than 8 months now much better positioned for growth and for increased profitability.
Thank you.
We will now open up the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.
Research Division</strong> I actually have 2 questions.
First on the market share.
Really I imagine that customers don't want to have one company to buy from regardless of market or geographies.
So can you tell us your thoughts on how long it should take to have the proper inventory ready the proper certifications? How long how many quarters should we expect this process you've described before you are truly ready to compete head-to-head? Let me be very clear.
The product localization under investment was not in every time zone in every country.
It was a few here and a few there.
And we believe that by doubling down on some of this field engineering investment that we will have all of those issues resolved by the end of this year setting us up we think for a very good 2014.
On your first question regarding customer desires for 1 or 2 solutions my perspective is as follows: Retail customers large retail customers prefer one solution and one solution only.
I can name less than 1 handful of U.S.
customers for instance that are national retailers that have used more than one type of system from multiple providers.
When you're dealing with distributors it's also very much the case that they build this help desk in a services operation around one chosen platform.
Where you get into multiple platforms is with large banks in both the developed and emerging markets who want to have a preferred solution and an alternative for obvious reasons mostly around pricing.
But even in those cases it's typically not 50-50.
There's some exceptions maybe perhaps in Brazil.
But it's typically there's a preferred vendor and there's an alternative.
And we're the preferred in many cases and our competitor is the preferred in other cases.
Research Division</strong> Okay that's helpful.
Just one follow-up now.
On the financial side how much -- I mean it seems like there was a lack of visibility through the last quarter in terms of what you were seeing shipped.
So going forward and now in your guidance how much clarity and visibility do you think you actually have in these new revenue numbers? And I mean it's definitely refreshing to hear you comment that there's renewed effort to improve each of your cash flow metrics going forward.
On that note can you -- is there any way you can give us a bit more detail on a bridge to the $170 million to $190 million range you've guided towards? Sure.
Let me make a few comments and Doug could add some more color on it.
Let me -- can I give you a little bit of color on just the guidance philosophy that I have? First of all we will do our darndest to set targets that are achievable.
The goal is not to be overly conservative here but it's to be sure not to be overly optimistic.
And I think we've struck the right balance for Q2 and more specifically the full year.
My point of view is to spend a lot more time with our P&amp;L owners in the field our general managers who are managing the regions and help drive the process to meet our numbers.
Having said that I've been here for and obviously just a few weeks and there's just plenty to learn.
But as I netted out I think our outlook kind of going forward is balanced.
When you look at the updated cash flows of $170 million to $190 million the downtick from the previous guidance is all driven by the reset on the annual plan.
It goes -- if you look at the EPS numbers it drops right down to -- our net income numbers drop right down to the reduced cash flow.
You saw our metrics were a little bit more challenged this quarter and the renewed focus is just going to drive cash flow the way we drive the rest of the business.
It's just going to have a lot of -- lot more of my attention.
The reality is that we're in a competitive environment but we need to compete consistently with our -- pretty much our #1 competitor on the way we give terms on our receivables and the like.
But I do believe that there's opportunity to improve in that area.
Research Division</strong> All right.
So it sounds like it's a combination of the change in net income combined with a lot of CapEx basically spending right? Correct.
Your next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> Just a follow-up on the guidance philosophy question.
It looks like you're implying sequential growth here going forward.
I know you've got the lunar new year issue coming up in the second quarter.
I'm just trying to understand a little bit more sort of your confidence level in hitting some of these numbers.
It doesn't sound like some of these things necessarily would be a quick fix.
Doug you said a matter of months not years.
I get that but can you give us a little bit more to sort of appreciate this step-up sequentially? Well we've typically been growing between Q2 and Q1.
We have hundreds of SKUs.
And we have to keep all of these SKUs current updated certified.
And the issue is significant but it was at the margins still.
I mean we still have lots of products and services that we sell every day that are market-leading and winning technology competitive evaluations et cetera.
So there's a lot of good stuff going on inside of VeriFone today.
You just obviously as I am are right now transfixed by all the stuff that we need to be fixing that's perhaps has gotten the spotlight.
The question on lunar new year it's not so problematic to a quarter when the Chinese New Year both for demand and for supply since we manufacture in China is at the beginning as it is the first couple of weeks of February because we can recover over the next 10 weeks.
When it becomes real problematic is when it's at the end of January when you don't really have any recovery time.
So we don't think Chinese New Year is going to be an issue for us this year.
Research Division</strong> No I mean just asking because I guess my worry is that these kind of disappointments that they come in bunches.
It's obviously going to be taken differently I would imagine which is why I was asking.
But maybe just as follow-up to -- just reconcile your comments about Europe specifically.
How much of this -- this was a macro versus the share loss potentially I guess to Ingenico which is doing quite well there.
I'm just trying to -- just trying to separate the macro from the self-inflicted issues you talked to.
What gives you confidence that you can gain back this -- the loss share component in Europe to Ingenico? Why wouldn't it be permanent? Nothing is permanent.
We've had many cycles or many phases in the 12 years I've been here that we've pulled ahead of Ingenico with a product or a product family or they pulled ahead of us.
In this case it was a preponderance of field engineering under investment and some management around that.
We will recover this.
We have a 32-year-old brand that is a proud brand.
We do a lot of really good stuff for our customers.
In fact many of them are waiting patiently for us to double down in some of these investments.
So there's no long-term problem nor is there any long-term franchise impact here we've just got to get back to our knitting not be overly distracted by our services initiatives but keep plugging away at that too and we'll get there.
To your question on the missed [ph] we've kind of big picture 40% of deferred revenue with distributors largely in that region 30% macro.
Asian RFPs weakening Europe.
Washington D.C.
Venezuela and about 30% of 60 call it 18 maybe even maximum 20 million related to these gaps in our product portfolio.
So we'll recover that.
But our guidance reflects not a lot of enthusiasm or hope for a macro recovery pan Europe this year.
I think we are where we are in Europe and we can either adjust to that reality or live in some sort of denial.
And I think perhaps we were living in a quasi state of denial in terms of the fact that very few retailers are opening new stores.
A lot of the compliance deadlines are behind us.
And the bright spot for us in Europe obviously are now going to be Germany because we have a competitive product hopefully France with -- in another quarter and Point.
It seems wherever Point is executing they're doing well.
And that management team is worthy of a lot of praise.
I mean they're growing in the double digits in Europe which tells you something fundamentally good is happening there.
Research Division</strong> All right.
That was good to know.
I'm glad to hear your guys are spending through it.
Yes this is the -- I think the big news for our employee yes we had a bump in the night all of us have gotten a big black eye over that.
But the response isn't to cut cost or to cut people.
The response is to add investment and to accelerate the hiring of people.
And that's typically not the response but we're not dealing with a weakening environment.
We're dealing with a stable macro environment with [ph] an opportunity for us to return or at 3 quarters from now fully and competitively positioned to grow at the industry average growth rates.
Your next question is from the line of Julio Quinteros Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Maybe Marc real quickly.
Can you just give us an update on the CapEx assumptions for the free cash flow number target that you've given both on the purchase of other assets for revenue generating and normal CapEx? Sure.
Let me just flip a page or 2 here.
So on the CapEx we've estimated the CapEx numbers and the free cash flow to be approximately $80 million.
$35 million of that is for the typical maintenance that could be real estate.
It could be for IT support as well as some of the equipment that we need to provide our contract manufacturers.
In the $80 million we're also assuming $45 million were revenue-generating assets which a significant portion of that is for the payment-as-a-service business with Point.
In fact there's also in the 8-K that we filed you'll see a copy of the slides and there's a backup that rolled through the cash flow assumptions.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I guess as you contemplate the continued growth of that service business Doug the levels of CapEx for revenue-generating assets has been kind of moving all over the place.
We had a number that was closer to $70 million just a couple of weeks ago and now we're looking at $45 million.
Is that because that business isn't expected to grow at the same rate? Or what else is going on there that is kind of causing that number to move around so much and actually moving down here which is obviously helping your free cash flow number? Right.
Well part of it is some of our -- we've downgraded the expectations for -- to your [ph] PumpPAY growth this year.
It's a development -- the slope of the curve is just a smaller number than the slope of the curve we had back in November and that was a major contributor.
The other thing which I apologize if this sounds like it's moving around -- or looks likes it's moving around from the outside is not all of these payments-as-a-services roll out outside of Europe are going to have the same financial model.
We're looking through -- we're looking at partners in some cases banks that are going to absorb a lot of the capital cost.
We're going to be white labeling Point in some markets.
So we've become a little more informed.
Marc is bringing a lot of hard questions to us to me as to why are we doing this? He's been obsessive compulsive about cash flow.
And I think we're going to become a little bit more enlightened on how we can not decelerate payments-as-a-service but do so in a slightly less capital-intensive way.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And maybe just one follow-up.
I mean a lot of the things that Marc is focused on the field level issues that he's highlighting talking to general managers talking to account executives et cetera those sound like COO-type roles I guess.
Is there a need for you guys to have somebody who has a better command of the operations at this point? Because it doesn't sound like at least on a field level you're getting the feedback that you need Doug to understand what's going on.
And to think that the CFO is the one that's going to be driving a lot of that it seems like -- is there a layer missing there? Or how do you get that feedback at this point? I don't think Marc was implying that he's -- he was going to talk to the operations folks to get real with them on a financial and forecasting basis.
We have an executive management team right now that has over the last 15 quarters allowed us to beat and raise guidance 10x or 11x in a row.
I apologize that's not absolutely the right number.
It felt like it for several years.
We've potentially in a couple of cases outgrown our ability in some geographies.
And you've heard my signaling a couple of times in the last hour about how we'll be making changes.
I take a very active operational role in the business.
I always will.
There could be more eyes and ears on the business that's not a bad idea.
The board is all over this as well.
And watch this space.
There'll be changes made over the next several months.
Your next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the free cash flow and kind of the cadence there because if we look at the EPS here for Q1 the $0.51 and just kind of annualize that it puts you very comfortably in your full year range which seems perfectly reasonable.
Obviously with the free cash flow I guess the math is a little bit different.
You had $33 million in Q1 and to annualize that would put you a bit short of the $170 million to $190 million.
So judging from your answer to the last question it sounds like the CapEx run rate is expected to stay pretty similar through the year if we're looking at $80 million for full year '13.
So it sounds like the sequential improvements are going to be on the operating cash flow.
So can you confirm that's the case and just kind of tease out for us what the drivers are the expected -- what seems to be expected improvement in converting non-GAAP net income to free cash flow? So yes I mean the cash flow will hopefully rise as revenue and net income rise sequentially throughout the year.
We've already signaled that.
And cash flow is a derivative of those 2 fundamentals.
And I think you're right to model kind of a flatlining of CapEx through the year.
That should get you to the number.
If we hit the revenue sequentiality we will make the cash flow.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay okay I'll go back through those numbers.
And just a follow-up.
I think when you issued the press release a couple of weeks ago there had been an indication there that your initial view on fiscal '14 was mid-to high-single digit net revenue growth.
Are you still comfortable with that? And is that a good proxy for kind of a longer-term outlook that we should be thinking about for VeriFone as you implement these new strategies to recapture market share? Right.
We lost market share for sure since the Hypercom acquisition.
Some of it was planned through revenue dysynergies [ph].
And so it was self-inflicted through some poor management of the resources and from under investment.
We will reclaim that market share over the next couple of years.
We will reclaim all of the ability to gain that market share back through technology excellence over the next 6 to 9 months.
Going into fiscal '14 when we'll be talking to you in the fall hopefully we'll be in a position to give not only '14 revenue and earnings guidance but to give a bit of a framework for a longer-term or intermediate term view on the market.
My sense is that the market structurally is very sound that the direction of technology complexity is continuing to move in our direction.
In fact ironically it moved so quickly over the last 9 months we didn't keep up with it in some cases.
And my personal commitment to my board is that we will over this next year at least be in a position to grow at industry growth rate.
And if that's 10% it'll be 10%.
If it's 4% it will be 4%.
But it's too early in '13 to opine on kind of the macro backdrop for 2014.
So we'll tune that up later in the fiscal year.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> That's fair.
Just a very quick clarification for Marc.
It sounds like based on your earlier comments you're not planning any material changes in how the company applies revenue recognition policies.
Is that fair? That's correct.
If we have any changes in accounting policies we'll certainly be transparent upfront on those changes.
There have been no changes and we don't have any expectation in the near term.
Your next question is from the line of John Williams UBS.
Research Division</strong> First off just on Latin America.
Last quarter you had referenced the missed revenue opportunity there.
It was I think $20 million or $25 million.
That seems like now what we know is that that wasn't necessarily the effect [ph].
But I think just Doug if you could provide a little bit of additional info we're just wanting to get a better sense of what the product gap is specifically.
So what was the specific product gap? Have you guys begun to fix it yet? And how long do you think it'll take in that market? Because I think that was something we were expecting would have at least a bit of a bounce back and that was a pretty material piece of the downside? Yes I don't think you're correct in the magnitude of the shortfall I think a few quarters ago.
I can honestly say that there's no given -- there's no architectural issue or platform issue.
It's localization issues for a particular product here or there many of them in Latin America and many of them have been in Europe.
And no particular shortfall in our analysis has caused anything more than $3 million or $4 million anywhere.
It's just that there's been 5 or 6 of these things which add up to $20 million to $25 million in the quarter.
I think we've described earlier in the script that Latin America had a couple of those.
It also had the Venezuelan currency freeze where even moneys in our bank account in that country weren't able to be extracted.
And also attempt good intended services contract with product ended up being deferred.
Frankly that's the way they always should have been and they always would have been planned.
But it comes down to sales execution and sales forecasting.
And in the future one of the remedies is when we see big opportunities of hundreds of thousands of systems and services sales we're just going to explain these to you and let the chips fall where they may.
So there's a lot of lessons learned here but a lot of ways we can -- and there's a lot of ways we can do a better job.
But the product efficiencies are all -- I'm not going to recite little things because there's just a bunch of little things and we're getting to them as we speak.
Research Division</strong> This sounds like -- to be clear this sounds like software versus hardware gap is that fair to say? Yes mostly.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I guess the follow-up on that is just as we think of scale on the pace of the investment that you have to make in R&amp;D through the year in the context of your segment margins is that mostly going to come based on what you're seeing in the services side? And I guess if maybe you could provide just a little bit more detail on how we should think about when we're modeling this what the impact through the rest of '13 might look like for each of the segments so we know how to think about margin? Well our gross margins are stable.
So this is all -- you're going to get to operating margins overall through an increased investment largely in what -- where we classified as R&amp;D.
In some cases sales and marketing or some field support which might show up in sales.
But Marc did you want to give any more color? I would just say there [ph] it's primarily as Doug pointed out is a system solution matter.
So the additional cost that we're funding will be primarily in that business area.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
One last thing.
I guess when you think of regaining shares pricing something you might use [indiscernible] to be able to do that in the next few months? I'm sorry say it again? Research Division</strong> Sorry.
As you think about the potential for regaining some of the share that you might have lost in the last few quarters would you use pricing a little bit more aggressively than you might otherwise use to try and recapture some of that? I don't think so.
I think our customers want to buy the best product they can.
There's obviously some price sensitivity.
But if you're missing a software component there's no price people are going to buy from you for.
Listen we're going to get to work on returning to the excellent product portfolio that we've always had that got us to where we are today and the market will take care of the market.
And excuse me John thanks for the question.
Your next question is from the line of Gil Luria Wedbush.
Research Division</strong> So when you look at that portfolio that you have you have some properties that you bought as part of Point and Hypercom that may not be for [ph] the ATM business and some of the networking business for Hypercom.
Would you consider looking at divesting some of those to help improve your margins in terms of the mix that you have? The Hypercom network business is doing fabulously and its margins are above the company average margin.
So the premise of your question with respect to that piece is not based in reality.
And so we -- and it's actually quite complementary because we sell these network access systems to emerging markets banks who are very much in love with the product.
I share your sentiment on the ATM services business in Point but it's a puny little business in a single digits of million.
So it really doesn't mean anything.
If somebody were to come along and offer us some -- an interesting price for it we probably take a look at it.
But it's not completely [indiscernible].
Research Division</strong> I was trying to ask more generally.
In terms of the -- I mentioned those 2 pieces more because they're not necessarily what you're doing in terms of your strategic thrust.
Are there other properties that you gathered along the way through these acquisitions that you could eliminate in order to improve margin? Not that I can think of.
Listen because we've been I think hyper-transformative not only through acquisition but inventing new markets we always have to maintain the discipline when we invent a new product or services category.
That if it's not working tutor it give it some help maybe put it through a review including some external eyes.
But ultimately if it's not producing the margins and the growth that you had hoped for you can't be shy about shooting things.
So we do that all the time and we'll continue to do it.
We're not in love with product or services that we invent.
They have to be contributors over time.
At the same time you also have to incubate things long enough so they can reach their tipping point.
So that's the art of management that we hope to be able to execute on.
Research Division</strong> And then very quickly as a follow-up.
Can you tell us one last time what revenue was for Point in the quarter? $57 million.
Your next question is from the line of Phil Stiller Citigroup.
Research Division</strong> I just want to come back to the cash flow.
Any updates in terms of use of cash for 2013? Obviously with the stock pulling back here significantly is the share buyback in consideration? And how much capacity would you have for something like that? Yes.
Remember a lot of our cash is abroad.
That's -- about 70% of it is abroad.
And I don't think anybody would recommend paying high-friction cost to bring it back.
But listen the board and I have -- are going to continue to have this discussion over time.
Right now the #1 focus of management is to fix the problem.
We're in a great industry with 1 bona fide competitor.
And get back to work.
So we're focused 100% on operations right now.
And hopefully over time regaining some of the confidence of our shareholders and to the sell side that we absolutely have lost over the last several weeks or maybe even several months.
And the other stuff will fall into place over time hopefully.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And Marc I know you talked about improving the working capital usage of the company.
Any targets in terms of DSOs or inventories or payables that we can think about on a longer-term basis? I'd like if you can allow me a little bit of time here to get more into it over the next coming months.
But generally speaking our target is to have no use of working capital by the end of this year.
So when I forecasted the cash flow as you'll see that there's a working capital usage of approximately breakeven.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just in terms of the deferred revenue that you pushed.
What were -- I mean what are you guys assuming in terms of the guidance? Is that reflected in the second quarter guidance? Or is that more of a back half fiscal year event? It's a combination of both.
I'd expect some of deferred revenue to roll out in Q2 and the remainder in the second half.
But we are offsetting that.
We're signing new services contracts that are creating new deferred revenue.
So while we might be the beneficiaries of some of the previously deferred stuff as it hits the income statement we're also parsing a lot of new revenue on balance sheet as well so.
Your next question is from the line of Keith Housum Northcoast Research.
Marc can you help me build a bridge for me for you in the North America revenue from first quarter last year to first quarter this year? If I heard  correct I thought I heard retail multi-lane retail is up 11% and petrol was up 10% and the small businesses were up solid as well.
So I guess what was down then during the quarter? I don't have all the details on North America at my fingertips.
I think taxi was down sequentially.
I don't know if it was down year-over-year but it was down sequentially.
Just a little bit of softness in advertising.
I know petrol was up small business was up multilane was up so.
Okay.
Maybe we can follow up later when you guys have a chance to do the numbers.
And then remind me here in terms of seasonalities to the Point business because it looks like sequentially you are down just a little bit.
Is that more seasonal-related? No they still have about 15% 16% of their business as resale business.
And that's lumpy.
Sometimes it's in the numbers sometimes it's not.
The real metric you should follow for Point is the services number because that's the fundamental flywheel that's growing over time.
And then you'll get quarter-to-quarter a $5 million sale or a $2 million sale in some instances where they just couldn't create a services contract out of it.
And that's the only thing that contributes to the non-monotonicity of their revenue over -- on a sequential basis.
We have time for one final question.
That will come from the line of James Faucette Pacific Crest.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Most of my questions have been answered.
I was wondering if you could just touch quickly on market share.
You've touched on Europe.
But can you also quickly touch on U.S.
and Brazil and how you're feeling about stabilizing and regaining market share trends in those geographies? We have no data suggesting we've lost an ounce of market share in the U.S.
Our management team our product localization group has done an outstanding job.
And I congratulate all of them if they're listening on defending a very large piece of market share in the U.S.
and doing a very good job.
We -- Brazil I think we've already suggested that there was some market share lost in Brazil probably $5 million or $10 million due to product localization.
Our customers still really like us still really depend on us and are sitting in the grandstands cheering for us to hurry up and get our act together.
And our product -- those products that were behind in certification back up to snuff.
So I think it's all up to us.
The -- we get the technology investment in and get the salespeople moving these products through.
We will have no permanent market share loss here.
It's -- I've been in a few crises in my life.
I've never had one more where it was all within your hands.
And we've -- with Marc's help with some of the new management team that we'll be bringing in some of the new organization that we're going to be announcing over the next couple of months we can do this and we will do this.
At this time there are no questions in queue.
I would like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Doug Bergeron for any closing remarks.
No that's it.
I think we've answered everything in a way that hopefully gives you the commitment that we have to fixing the ship and our new heightened commitment to transparency.
Our doors are always open for any calls by investors or by the sell-side to help you understand how we're making progress along the way.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference.
We thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a great day.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Second Quarter VeriFone Systems Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Philip and I will be your operator for today.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today Mr.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rich McGinn interim CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug.
And good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.
I appreciate this opportunity to speak with you today.
A lot has happened at VeriFone in the past few months and I'm sure you have many questions which we will address shortly.
The plan today is to walk you through what has been going at VeriFone in the past 90 days and what I've been doing since I was named interim CEO.
I will also share with you some of the changes that are already underway at the company changes that I and the team here at VeriFone feel confident will once again put the company on a growth path.
Having said that we are well aware that we have significant short-term challenges impacting our fiscal year 2013 results.
Challenges have resulted in a miss to our financial guidance for the year including a significant takedown disclosed today for the second half of 2013.
We're addressing the issues that have caused our current situation head-on for the benefit of sustainable mid- and long-term value creation.
This includes significant and necessary personnel changes which we have made during Q2.
What I want you to understand at the end of this call is the following: As I just stated we're facing our issues head-on.
We know we have them including some issues of product competitiveness in selected markets.
Second we have and are taking immediate and decisive action starting with a major shift in the mindset that incorporates greater connectivity to our customers and their current and future needs.
Third we have good competitors but these issues are not a function of competitors leaping ahead or the famous notion of disintermediation.
These are homegrown issues.
We caused them and we know how to fix them.
Fourth VeriFone is an excellent company with a great franchise in the payments technology business.
We are a global market leader in the industry and that industry is expected to grow in the mid to high single digits per year.
We will build on our position.
Moreover we have a solid balance sheet we generate significant free cash flow and we have a gross margin structure that gives us the resources to invest in the areas we need to in order to ensure a terrific future.
It will take some time for us to get back on a growth track but by the end of this call I hope you will see why we have every confidence that we'll get there.
To set the stage VeriFone has been an innovator and a leader in the payments industry for decades.
Unfortunately certain product and investment decisions taken in the recent past have had unintended consequences that have negatively impacted that position.
Our beliefs about productivity improvements in R&amp;D have proven not to be correct.
The result not surprisingly has been that some customers in selected markets have made choices to meet an immediate need with non-VeriFone products.
In addition we had a poor track record of completing certification of products in a timely fashion.
This has contributed to customer and partner dissatisfaction.
Since taking the helm this quarter I have made it a priority to meet with customers in selected markets and to listen to their views on VeriFone what they think we do well what they think we can do better and what they need from us.
But honestly it's been an eye opening process.
They have been brutally honest about our lack of partnership and it has been made clear to all of us at VeriFone that things have to change.
On a positive note I've heard many encouraging comments from our customers about our people at VeriFone and the deep relationships that they've built over the years.
Our people held the line when the institution fell short of expectations.
The great news is that the people of VeriFone and our customers understand our core strengths and fully embrace the need for change.
Part of the change at VeriFone is shifting to a customer focus and a willingness to invest in technology to support these customer needs.
That focus will give us a higher quality approach to sustaining and building our business.
We have good competitors but we have to move on.
Let me also discuss an issue noted in our prior quarter.
We faced an issue with our Middle East distributor selling into an embargoed country.
This is not the kind of business we need or want at VeriFone and it will not happen again.
We terminated our relationship with the distributor in the Middle East who failed to live up to our ethical standards and to the requirements of our government.
We engaged outside counsel and following the investigation we self-reported to the U.S.
government.
We are addressing the consequences of this activity.
This has hit our current period performance quite hard and will have a negative impact on our results.
We could not allow our brand to be dragged down by others who do not act in a manner consistent with our standards.
We are feeling the short-term consequences but we have done the right thing for the long term.
We're beginning to rebuild our business in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa.
This will take time.
Before I walk you through what we've done over the past few months I'd like to share some thoughts on our M&amp;A activities.
I feel good about the companies that we've bought in recent years and the value that has been created.
Going forward our primary focus is on our operations.
In essence we are focusing on organic growth.
For the past 90 days we've been engaged in in-depth analysis of our existing terminals services and content delivery business.
This analysis has given us a clear understanding of our considerable strength and our shortcomings.
This also allowed us to vividly describe the case for change here at VeriFone.
Here are some of the actions that we've taken so far.
On the management front we have put a new senior management team in place from sales R&amp;D to operations to finance.
It has been comprehensive.
We replaced a significant number of general managers as well around the globe in Europe the Middle East Asia.
This is now a strong group of business leaders.
We will be adding additional talent to this group in the next weeks and months.
I feel good about the team we're putting together.
On the R&amp;D and product front first and foremost the lack of R&amp;D investment forced some of our important customers to seek solutions from competitors.
After years of meeting their needs with great products and service we took a decision about investing in new product development.
This lack of investment has resulted in delayed product releases and a poor track record of completing those products.
All of this has contributed to customer and partner dissatisfaction which is now manifesting in a top line decline.
To reverse this we have prioritized and authorized a substantial increase in both R&amp;D and sales to reestablish our traditional strength in high-quality devices.
Here are a few examples.
To help improve our ability to serve our customers well we significantly increased investments in next-generation POS devices wireless portable terminals unattended POS devices and mobility or mPOS-enabling systems and the software for our most critical markets.
We're expanding our GlobalBay software platform to include an mPOS application for our partner community targeted for the growing opportunity with Tier 3 and Tier 4 merchants migrating towards tablet-based POS.
The application will be available for iOS tablets later this month with an Android version available later this year.
We've begun working with selected customers in Europe to offer cloud-based management information services based on the many transactions we handle.
Our customers see great value in this detailed information they're able to get from us.
We have made a decision to leverage the substantial intellectual horsepower in the development community beyond VeriFone.
This strategy will take some time to develop but we have begun to consolidate our R&amp;D investment on our Linux-based operating system software platform.
We have decided to open this platform up to developers through published SDKs and developer support.
As part of this effort we are porting existing customer-critical applications to this new platform.
The response to this has been very positive.
As well we're adding more field applications engineers to address opportunities at the customer interface.
We are also focusing on substantial operational change including reviewing our supplier relationships operational measures such quality assurance inventory management.
We are overhauling our demand planning and supply chain operation which we expect will yield increased value for us as we build new products reducing cost and improve inventory turnover.
On the financial front we are focused on improved cash management which we believe can go and will go hand-in-hand with solid growth in the business.
On the systems front we're investing in our system infrastructure to be able to provide value-added services to our customers through our local and regional gateways and generate more revenue per employee.
On the litigation front we are moving ahead to resolve a number of lawsuits which have been facing us quite some time.
And the last but most importantly on the customer front the conversation with our customers and our partners is changing for the better.
Our mission is to regain their confidence by virtue of our action and that's beginning to happen.
We are once again being seen as a critical player in their strategies as they reinvent the shopping experience for their customers and have flexibility in the way to pay enabled by different thinking and new technologies.
I'm very happy to report to you that there are good things that are happening.
Recently we won a hotly contested payments platform award with a very large U.S.
multi-lane retailer for integrated services terminals and cloud-based device management.
This was a unified company effort and an important competitive win for us.
As well we won an important mPOS platform with a large U.S.
retailer who is widely embracing mobility in payments as a way to define a frictionless shopping experience for their customers.
This is an important new customer for us.
We won important positions with major customers in Italy and Spain improving our positions in these markets.
And additionally we won a substantial piece of business with a U.S.
petroleum industry leader for both systems and services.
These were all very competitive engagements and they're indicators of what we're capable of doing what we're capable of accomplishing when we focus and we allocate resources.
We hope this is giving you a good sense of how we're evolving VeriFone and what we've been doing for the past 3 months.
We're part of an exciting and dynamic industry that presents us with great opportunities.
The payment industry is a vibrant worldwide growing market which continues to expand as consumers move inexorably from a world where value exchange is defined by cash and checks to one of electronic payments.
There are approximately $17 trillion of electronic payments worldwide not counting P2P transfers.
VeriFone technology drives nearly $7 trillion of that total worldwide.
75% of our business is outside the United States and 100 billion transactions in the year go through our devices.
Annual card spending continues to grow rapidly and will reach nearly $20 trillion in the next few years.
All of this will occur as the exchange of value at the point-of-sale continues to grow more complex.
All of this translates into a global market for devices growing at mid to high single percentage per year.
Additionally the global market for payment-as-a-service where we're well-positioned is growing even faster in the 11% to 13% range.
There is no lack of opportunity for us in this industry.
Competition from traditional competitors and new entrants is robust and speaks to the vitality and the opportunities in the marketplace.
At VeriFone we have to take advantage of these opportunities with better decision better execution.
We're making choices and allocating resources to build on our core strengths.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Marc Rothman our new CFO who joined us this past quarter as well for a review on our results.
And I'll come back after his remarks to provide some additional perspective.
Marc? Thanks Rich.
Consistent with the company's past practice we will be referring to certain income statement items on a non-GAAP basis.
Let me begin by highlighting our key financial metrics.
For the second fiscal quarter we reported revenue of $430 million compared to $479 million a year ago down 10%.
Our results for this quarter were $5 million below the low end of our previous guidance.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 compared to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 a year ago.
Our results were also $0.03 below the low end of our previous guidance.
Our GAAP earnings per share loss of $0.54 compared to a profit of $0.03 a year ago and includes $69 million in reserves for litigation matters.
And our cash flow from operations was $79 million versus $31 million a year ago significantly better than our plan.
This was as a result of increased focus and improvement on cash generation and better working capital management during the quarter.
I'd like to discuss briefly our regional results.
Our North American business recorded revenues of $122 million reflecting a decline of 6% compared to a year ago.
This decrease relates almost entirely to our petroleum business due to timing of customer orders.
In petro we've won a significant site point-of-sale contract with one of our largest customers during Q2 that is expected to generate approximately $50 million of revenue over the next several quarters.
In our U.S.
retail business we continue to see strong demand for our core integrated retail offering the MX 900 Series.
In the quarter we won 12 customer awards with our MX 900 Series platform from the incumbent competitor without losing a single customer.
This includes brands such as GMC Trader Joe's Belk Gymboree Aeropostale Casual Man John Deere Vitamin Shoppe Express Fifth &amp; Pacific.
VeriFone has shipped more than 150 000 MX 900 Series products in the first 12 months of our life.
Revenues in Latin America for the second quarter were $85 million down 11% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis and up 17% from last quarter.
In Brazil which represented almost 60% of our Latin American business we are progressing on our certifications of 3G products in order to meet the growing demand in the market.
In addition longer-term we continue to see mounting interest in our taxi and mobility solutions especially as the country begins preparations for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.
Turning to Europe the Middle East and Africa.
Revenues of $173 million were down 16% year-over-year and comparable on a sequential basis.
We were disappointed with our performance relative to our expectation in certain key European Middle East and Africa countries specifically related to delayed product certifications in Europe and certain distribution channel changes Rich just discussed in the Middle East and Africa.
Having said that we are significantly investing in this market to enhance our portfolio and begin to rebuild our distribution channels.
On a very positive note in Russia we won 80% of the product tender for Sberbank the country's largest bank.
The total award for 450 000 small and medium business payment terminals over 2 years creates a solid foundation for future business growth in this country.
Finally turning to Asia.
Q2 revenues of $50 million were up 2% year-over-year and on a sequential basis sales were down 3%.
Sales in our China market grew 11% on a year-over-year basis and in India sales regained some momentum with customers placing orders for new terminals to meet compliance mandates.
Turning now to our system solutions and service revenue and margin mix.
Our system solutions revenue was $279 million in Q2.
This was down 19% from the prior year.
The most significant decline was in Europe Middle East and Africa with smaller reductions in North America Latin America and Asia.
Revenues were down 1% sequentially whereby declines in North America specifically our petro vertical were substantially offset by increased sales in Latin America.
Our services revenue were $151 million in Q2 an increase of 11% year-over-year and 2% sequentially.
Services revenue represented 35% of our total revenue in Q2 up slightly on a sequential basis.
Our Point services business delivered service revenues of $49 million and continues to do very well growing 26% on a year-over-year basis.
Our points-of-sale installed base of all-in-one systems those based on the Point payment-as-a-service model grew 27% in the last 12 months.
All-in-one is our name for the multi-year contract combining systems and services.
In the all-in-one offering 30% of our sales are for our higher-priced premium and premium-plus packages compared to approximately 20% last year as customers see significant value in the additional feature sets.
Overall gross margins were 42.2% a decrease of 140 basis points from our first quarter and down 240 basis points from a year ago.
Our system solutions gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 40.8% down 380 basis points from the prior year and 160 basis points sequentially.
This decline relates to less favorable geographic and product mix.
Additionally we have experienced some gross margin pressure in our Europe Middle East and Africa region due to selling price pressure and customer mix.
Our service gross margins were 44.9% a decrease of 80 basis points from Q1.
This sequential reduction primarily reflects the impact of lower taxi advertising revenue this period.
Let me now discuss operating expenses.
Last quarter we stated our intention to increase resources related to enhancing our product portfolio.
This is a decision that we continue to believe in and will continue to move forward on.
During the quarter our operating expenses were $115 million an increase of $6 million over the prior quarter.
R&amp;D increased by $3 million as a result of our increased investment in product development.
While we are investing in future products and service offerings we are also focused on being efficient in our spending.
A very important and significant wide initiative in the quarter relates to further centralization of our procurement activity.
We see significant opportunities to consolidate suppliers reduce complexity and drive significant savings.
This is an ongoing and strategic project which we will update you on periodically.
I wanted to also make a few comments on other significant charges incurred during the quarter which are included in our GAAP results.
As we have previously disclosed in our regulatory filings the company has several outstanding legal matters.
During the quarter we engaged in a significant settlement discussion with respect to our 2008 shareholder litigation and to a much smaller extent litigation related to pre-acquisition Hypercom matters which collectively resulted in a $69 million charge.
While these matters are not yet finalized we believe the amounts reflect an appropriate estimate of the ultimate outcome for these matters.
Also during the quarter we recorded an $8 million noncash charge related to our U.K.
taxi business due to unfavorable business conditions in that market relative to our earlier investments and expectations.
Additionally we incurred severance costs related to our recent executive management changes.
Please refer to our financial schedules and our press release for further information.
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet.
We are very pleased with our progress this quarter on improving both the balance sheet and our focus on cash management.
Cash flow as Rich commented will be a key priority for the entire VeriFone team.
Our cash balance of $506 million grew $29 million from the prior quarter and our net debt is $773 million down $199 million from this time a year ago.
Continuing with the balance sheet our accounts receivable balance declined to $316 million and our related days sales outstanding improved 8 days to 66 days.
This improvement is due primarily to additional focus and more coordinated effort amongst our sales and collections teams.
Inventory of $181 million decreased by $8 million and inventory measured as days of supply decreased 1 day to 67 days.
We plan to make continuous process improvements around our demand planning activities to optimize inventory levels and improve our overall product costs.
Accounts payable ended the quarter at $151 million a decrease of $4 million quarter-over-quarter.
Our days payable outstanding for the quarter decreased from 57 days in the previous quarter's 55 days.
We will be reviewing our payable terms with our vendors on a regular basis.
In addition as part of our centralized procurement initiative I noted we intend to review opportunities to further manage payment terms with our select vendors as well.
We'll be very focused on these initiatives to improve each of our cash conversion cycle metrics as well as our cash flow moving forward.
And now moving forward to our cash flow.
In the second quarter of 2013 cash flow from operations was $79 million.
During the quarter we invested $20 million in capital expenditures including $9 million on revenue-generating assets mainly systems for our Point deployment and taxi business and our free cash flow is $58 million for the quarter.
This was a substantial improvement from the $33 million in the first quarter.
As a result of potential payments related to the litigation matters I highlighted earlier we expect cash flow from operations to be impacted by approximately $69 million over the next several quarters.
Excluding these payments we expect to generate an additional $40 million to $50 million of free cash flow in the second half of this year.
On a more challenging front we are lowering our guidance.
We now expect our non-GAAP revenue in Q3 to be down sequentially to approximately $400 million.
We also expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.20.
This reflects the competitive challenges for certain of our product lines in select markets as well as our increased investment required to generate higher growth over the mid and long term.
For the fourth quarter we expect modest sequential growth in revenue and earnings per share resulting from an improved pipeline of awarded transactions specifically in North America.
We would expect Q1 2014 to be another rebuilding quarter reflecting some improvement sequentially.
As we fill our pipeline with new products complete our product certifications and strengthen our distribution channel in the Middle East and Africa we expect beginning in Q2 2014 to recapture our lost market share and therefore grow modestly higher in the industry growth rates we discussed earlier.
For fiscal year 2014 we will provide more guidance on our financial metrics in the coming months.
We do anticipate improvements from current levels of operating margins as we refresh our portfolio and leverage our existing infrastructure.
Thank you.
And let me turn the call back over to Rich.
Thank you Marc.
I'd like to provide some additional color on the near-term guidance.
Issues that we're dealing with have been in the making for quite a while and needed to be corrected.
As Marc outlined based on what we know now we're looking for Q3 to be another down quarter.
After pressure testing our customers and our business leaders we have given you our best current estimate.
As of now we expect Q3 to be impacted by the same issues that we experienced in Q2 as the impact of the Middle East distributor situation flows through the balance of this year.
And as well the spending on R&amp;D and technical sales personnel critical to our future continues.
By Q4 some of the new deals I mentioned earlier including the U.S.
petro deal among others will begin shipping more significantly which means that this will be a plus will help offset some of the near-term minuses I described.
2014 a more robust pipeline of wireless and mobile products that we are finalizing now along with services and petro offerings will set us on a new growth path more so in the second half 2014.
I've attempted to be clear in calling out our challenges.
Allow me to end this portion of the call on a positive note.
VeriFone remains a market leader and very well-positioned in a growing industry.
There are several key messages I want you to take away from this today.
Our efforts are stabilizing the business and defending our strongholds.
Our relevance to our customers is high.
It remains high.
We are selectively expanding our attractive payment-as-a-service business and the customer reaction is very positive.
We're focused on growing share in Asia where economic growth remains strong.
We're investing to establish leadership in mobility broadly defined.
Our foundation is solid.
Our building path is clear.
We're committed to implementing these plans over the next few quarters to reestablish ourselves as leaders.
I hope we've answered many of your questions in our prepared remarks.
And one that I know that you have that we have not discussed so far is the status of the CEO search.
It is the board's desire to make a decision regarding a permanent CEO as soon as possible which everyone agrees is in the best interest of the company.
They take this responsibility very seriously.
That said I accepted the interim job knowing full well the challenges that we have.
We're not waiting for a decision.
We are moving ahead to rebuild this business.
That is our commitment to you our owners.
Thank you very much.
With that I'd like to open it up to Q&amp;A.
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.
Research Division</strong> I just want to start off.
Last quarter I know you disclosed earlier that some of the same issues that were affecting last quarter are affecting this quarter and the outlook again.
When you talked the last quarter about revenue deferral and some product certification issues and market share.
This quarter you're saying now for the third quarter $400 million which as you said another step down and you said it's related to similar issues.
What I think would be helpful though is number one if you can give us more specifics.
Is it further deferral of revenue? One would think deferral of revenue from last quarter would start showing up positively by the third quarter.
Maybe you can explain that.
And then also on the product certification and market share how much of that is still an issue? Is it an increasing issue versus what you saw last quarter? And then maybe just leave us with how much confidence we can have that this new $400 million revenue number's really the low and the right level and it's going to accelerate from there.
Thanks Darrin.
This is Rich.
First of all the process for estimating or analyzing the prospects of the business.
They had been in place for a long time have changed.
We've taken a much more comprehensive view and adjusted upward risk profiles the business possibilities during the quarter.
We changed that system for how we think about our prospects.
We feel that gives us a much higher likelihood that what we say is what is going to happen.
And we are trying to build confidence to say that going forward what we say is what we're going to do.
Very important to us.
We know it's important to you.
To your point on deferral this is not about deferred revenue.
There was some conversation about some expectation of some business in U.S.
petro was expected in the quarter.
It has been moved to the following quarter.
That's not deferral per se.
Really what we have here is that our distribution channel in the Mid East basically has been dismantled.
We lost business last quarter this quarter and for a good portion of the rest of this year.
We have to rebuild that.
But really you should think about that as a step function downward in our business as we moved away from the distributor who did not meet our standards and in fact didn't meet the standards of the government.
We are working in other places to build a better and greater book of business to compensate for that but we think that the work that we're doing to stabilize the business comes in at about the $400 million level.
That's the guidance we're giving for Q3 and as Marc indicated sequentially up in the fourth quarter and then an improving situation throughout the year in 2014.
To your point on product certification this issue is an issue writ large for us going hand-in-hand with product development because we underinvested in R&amp;D thinking we could get more productivity out of the dollars that we were spending.
It was not a correct assumption.
It was a judgment and it did not work.
And we have made the decision to invest more money in both the resources required the certification the finalization of R&amp;D budgets and in some cases to actually restart projects that were slowed down or stopped altogether and have put us in a bad situation in a few places in the world.
You can see by the comments I made about the wins that we're having.
Where we did not pull back on investment we're doing very well.
But where we did we were not able to hold the line with the products we had in place.
So that gives us a sense that we have the confidence that when we invest properly we'll come out in the right place.
Hopefully that answers your...
Research Division</strong> All right.
That's helpful.
Just based on your comments on the end of the year showing off some of these new product wins I mean I would assume that the run rate going out of fourth quarter should be substantially higher.
I mean is that something that we can count on for 2014 being sort of a step-up here from a revenue standpoint? Well you say substantial step-up this year.
I didn't say that and I don't think that Marc said that.
I think he said sequentially higher.
And what we said is that going into 2014 we can expect during the year 2014 to have a rate greater than the overall growth rate of the marketplace.
And Darrin just to -- again just to reiterate what Rich said $400 million approximately for Q3 up sequentially again in Q4 and up sequentially off of that baseline not making the comparison to the first quarter of 2013.
Research Division</strong> All right.
That's helpful.
Just 1 quick follow-up and I'll turn it back over.
On the cash flow side from operations really from -- actually from a free cash flow side I think you said $58 million in the quarter.
There was $33 million last quarter.
And then Marc I think you said you expect about $40 million to $50 million.
Was it the second half or in the per quarter? I mean just can you give more color on that? Sure Darrin.
It's $40 million to $50 million planned for the second half of the year and it reflects the takedown of the earnings per share that I discussed earlier.
Additionally it could include the litigation item of $69 million that I mentioned earlier if it gets paid in the second half of this year.
It could go into next year but I wanted to put it out there.
$70 million -- approximately $70 million may be paid in the third or fourth quarter but [indiscernible].
Research Division</strong> All right.
So the $40 million to $50 million in the second half assumes that that $69 million is already in it? It does not.
It does not.
The $40 million to $50 million assumes cash flow x that item.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just -- then just to be clear why would it be? I mean you're calling for at least a revenue pickup understanding that earnings is a little bit lower.
Why would it be only about a $20 million to $25 million quarterly run rate with a similar -- at least a similar revenue number for the third quarter versus this quarter is it just the investments you're making in the business and the lower earnings? It's a combination of the revenue coming down in the second half.
Certainly the earnings per share is coming down in the second half and that will impact the cash flow.
Clearly our efforts and focus on working capital management will be pressed and we'll be looking to improve upon that number.
But as of now the range that I gave you $40 million to $50 million x the litigation is most appropriate for modeling.
Your next question comes from the line of John Williams from UBS.
Research Division</strong> So I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on the revenue guide the $400 million.
So just looking at where you are now in the second quarter and where you're implying you're going to be in the third quarter it implies that in all or some of the geographies you're expecting to see a pretty substantial downtick in growth even from where we are here.
And so what would be helpful I think as we try to model if you could give us a sense of within the 4 markets North America LatAm EMEA and Asia how we should think about the sequential trend relative to what we saw in this quarter because it seems like LatAm ticked back up nicely.
EMEA was flat which was better than down I suppose.
But how should we think about the geographic split as we look at the third quarter and potentially even the fourth quarter? Very good John.
I can do that if we want to give more transparency given the state of the business today.
So let me give you some color on the regional flow for the next quarter or so.
So North America generally speaking from Q2 to Q3 I expect it to be flattish and ramping up in Q4 as we begin to execute on the contracts and other opportunities that Rich discussed earlier.
In the Middle East and Africa and Europe we expect continued softness.
That's mostly product-driven as well as the continued rebuild in the Middle East Africa region that we discussed.
And in Latin America most importantly although we were very pleased with the 17% growth year-on-year we're going to see a downtick -- a significant downtick in Q3 because of expected temporary competitive losses.
There is just a number of delays in the certifications specifically in the 3G dual SIM products that we have in Brazil.
And it's in the lab and we will get them certified probably late Q4 early Q1.
But that's impacting the second half of the year for us.
So please -- what we did the first half of the year in Latin America.
But Latin America is going to be a downtick -- temporary downtick for the second half.
And in Asia real quickly it will be relatively flat to the second half -- in second half relative to what we just reported should be -- maybe a slight uptick with the M&amp;A work that we did.
Setting aside the Mid East the glaring example of the fact that we didn't have the product in place to get it certified that's a function of the decision made on resources.
And now we've really redoubled our effort in that area.
We understand the importance of the products.
The customers have told us that.
But they need stop gap efforts to put in some 3G-based products that will get them elsewhere.
And with the confidence that they have in us that we will deliver high-quality products to them we feel good about what happens once the product is available.
John? Research Division</strong> Just if I could dig a little deeper just into the EMEA business.
So Marc you said continued softness and obviously the rebuild going on there but I guess how do you think of just in terms of semantics softness? Is it soft relative to what you put up in the second half of last year where the run rate was basically $200 million? Or is it soft relative to what you put up in the first half of this year which is $170 million $175 million or so? Right.
It's a baseline off of the current numbers this year.
So the $173 million that we had in Q2 that's the baseline and it will be modestly down from those numbers.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
That's helpful.
The other question I had was just in terms of the incremental EMV impact in the U.S.
particularly starting to filter its way into the model how do we think about that? When should that start to come in? Because my sense is that investors are looking at '14 now for the most part and I just want to make sure that again as we think about that we're bringing that EMV impact in at some point as an incremental improvement.
The marketplace is beginning to make some moves now to embrace EMV.
Some important players are making decisions to implement EMV and also NFC in their future rollouts.
We expect that it will increase during 2014.
Again we're talking non-petro here which has the capacity to wait until 2017.
But we expect it'll be in full bloom by the end of 2014 and 2015.
And that is something of course.
Given our relationship with the customers in the U.S.
we have a good position to take advantage of but it doesn't occur to any great extent during the early part of the year.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And are the products generally in the U.S.
much more I guess in tune with what customers need? Or are they compliant for that rollout? Or is there any additional work you might have to do here to make sure you're providing the right things? The good news about this is that we have been deploying EMV products around the world for years now with 75% of our business x U.S.
So we are well-positioned in terms of both knowledge and experience in doing this and bring that to bear on the U.S.
rollout in a very positive way.
And your next call comes from the line of Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Maybe just real quickly on just the fine-tuning of the model a couple of questions on the cash flow side.
The $40 million to $50 million that was a second half number not per quarter.
Correct? Correct Julio.
Research Division</strong> And then what is the quarterly run rate on the CapEx components the PP&amp;E and the investments revenues quarterly if you have them or annual? I have.
I'm sorry Julio? Research Division</strong> Sorry.
Either quarterly or for the second half however you guys have them.
For the second half of the year we expect the CapEx numbers to be approximately $50 million so probably $23 million to $25 million in Q3 and up slightly from there reflecting continued deployment of these revenue-generating assets that we have for the Point business model and our taxi model and some of our secure PumpPAY on the petro side.
That would be my expectation at this point for the second half of the year.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So that's both the normal PP&amp;E plus the revenue-generating assets combined? That's correct.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Got it.
And then just maybe going back to North America.
I think you guys characterized some of the weakness there as almost all of it being related to petro but to also have another quarter I guess the flat/flattish-type numbers is there something else that's also impacting the North America side? Because the press release obviously cites good strength and relative sort of no losses there in terms of competition but the numbers seem to be a little bit flatter than that.
Again I think I just want to make sure that that's related to petro.
Or is there another call out there in terms of North America revenue growth? Sure.
When you define it as North America as opposed to United States there have been losses in Canada in share.
We did not deliver quality product on time to Canada and that is a direct impact to us.
You're seeing a pattern here.
If we didn't put the resources on the projects or a given set of customers in a country we did not do well.
We give up share or we get delays.
Where we have invested we are doing well.
So that's why we feel very good -- we feel very confident about the actions that we're taking and the impact that those actions will have once those products roll out.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So there's a clear distinction between U.S.
North America and Canada obviously impacting North America.
Maybe just as a last point on that.
If you focus just on the U.S.
business small merchants versus large merchants and just maybe call out new entrant impact are you seeing any competitive losses away from you guys in the U.S.
because new entrants are there with their dongles or their integrated POS systems or tablets whatever? If you can just distinguish in terms of competitive dynamics or small versus large in the U.S.
alone that would be great.
Sure Julio.
To a great extent VeriFone has been addressing the Tier 1 Tier 2 to a lesser extent the Tier 3 Tier 4 products over time the opportunities.
And new entrants that have come in with very interesting kinds of technology and business models have in the main come in to address the Tier 4 and more recently some of the Tier 3 opportunities.
We see there's good competitors.
We've looked at these things.
We think that there's opportunity there.
But really it hasn't been a big impact in growth for us or a diminution of our growth.
I think recently one of the competitors in that space they're now processing $15 billion total of payments in a year and that's good.
That's substantial.
It's not a place where we are well-represented at this point in time.
But I think that with our move to new tablet-based systems for the Tier 3 Tier 4 partners and the ISOs and others we'll be able to expand the marketplace where we're really not that present today.
So we see an opportunity for an uptick.
And if there were no competitors it would probably signal it's not a very attractive marketplace.
And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> So you gave us a pretty decent sense of how you see the revenue picture unfolding as we move into and throughout fiscal '14.
But I wanted to see if some of those same comments around sequential growth also apply to the EPS run rate beyond Q4 of this year just considering the fact that you are making these elevated investments and it sounds like those are going to be lasting more than a couple of quarters.
So how should we start to think conceptually about the EPS picture on a quarterly basis beyond Q4 of this year? Jason this is Marc.
Thank you.
What I tried to do today was to give you some color relative to 2014 on the top line.
My expectation our expectation is that as our top line grows we're going to leverage the infrastructure investments that we've made to-date and we are planning -- we'll provide more information as we progress into the year planning for a gross margin improvement with a refreshed portfolio.
We'll provide more color on that as we get into next year or late into this year.
And that would -- I'd have an expectation that that would improve our earnings per share performance.
But it's really color and direction only right now.
We'll get into more specifics in the coming months.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I mean just given where the earnings run rate seems to be heading here in the second half of fiscal '13 and then beyond that I mean should investors have any incremental concern around some of the covenants that you guys have? Maybe you can just refresh us on -- I think there are 2 primary covenants in there in terms of a couple of ratios.
So we're making -- you saw this quarter we've generated a significant amount of cash and the cash is at a record level of $506 million [indiscernible].
That's the second highest level actually over the last several years.
We have opportunities to pay down some debt if we choose to.
But right now we -- you're right we do have certain financial and maintenance covenants and we expect to be able to manage through those.
One of the good things about this business is that when you focus on it you produce cash.
It's a very very good position to be in and we intend to improve upon that by virtue of the operating performance the focus that we're giving it.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just lastly can we get a little bit more color on the progress of the CEO search? I mean obviously you said it's a high priority for the board but I mean is this something that we're weeks away from or months away from or somewhere in between? Well I don't think there's any handicapping involved in that.
I don't have any other comments other than the fact that I know that the board is really focused on doing this.
And when they find the right candidate the board will act swiftly.
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's question-and-answer session on today's conference.
I would now like to turn the call over to Rich McGinn for closing remarks.
First of all let me thank you all for your time your attention and your questions.
We are Marc and I trying to give you to the fullest extent we can the transparent view of what's going on with this business to be open about the challenges we face and as well about the opportunities that we see as we rebuild the business.
We indicated it's a great core franchise where we've invested.
We're doing very well thank you.
And we intend to expand that to the other areas where there are substantial opportunities.
We expect to capitalize on that and to reestablish ourselves as leaders over the next year.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate your time.
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference.
Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.
Have a great day.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 VeriFone Systems Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Derrick and I'll be your operator for today.

[Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Rich McGinn Interim CEO of VeriFone.
Thanks Doug and thank you everyone for joining us today.
We appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and look forward to answering your questions at the end of the call.
As part of this quarterly financial results call we'll provide you with the report on the progress that we've been making to reestablish the competitiveness and the vitality of VeriFone's business.
We continue to focus our efforts on addressing the challenges we shared with you last quarter and have begun to see positive feedback from the market that our efforts are in fact paying off.
Not only have we exceeded our financial guidance for the third quarter but we're seeing improved customer and partner interactions and a dramatic increase in the sense of urgency and the pace of change in the company.
Again we have more to do but the path ahead is becoming clearer and more attainable.
Now I'd like to detail the progress that we've made with regard to some of the challenges that we discussed last quarter.
First let me address R&amp;D.
Last quarter I told you that we authorized a substantial increase for both R&amp;D and customer-facing resources to reestablish our traditional strength in high-quality devices and to sustain customer relationships.
We've added more developers and field engineers to expedite the delivery of next-generation countertop portable and unattended POS devices.
We've opened a record number of certification evaluations an important step in the product certification process in order to bring these products to the local markets where they're needed most.
We continue to focus on enhancing our product portfolios across all regions and we are making good progress with additional work to be done over the next few quarters.
There are a number of exciting developments that are underway.
First our decision to open our new Linux-based software platform has been very well received.
It is not only attractive to the broader software development community but it's also a symbol that we're changing the way we collaborate with our industry partners as well as the new entrants who wish to add value to the payments industry.
Developers throughout the industry are comfortable that they can more easily add vertical market value by working with us on this open platform where they have considerable technical expertise.
Original development integration and application certifications will be much easier and much faster.
Our decision to future-proof partner and customer applications written for earlier OS environments which would be ported to our new Linux VOS preserves the value of these investments and reduces the friction typically associated with major software upgrades.
Next recent software and systems introductions have received excellent response from our partners and early customers.
This week we introduced a new payments software suite GlobalBay Merchant running on iOS tablets for Tier 3 and Tier 4 small and midsized merchants available exclusively through our partners.
At launch we had already signed more than a dozen partners that serve more than 500 000 merchants.
We're in discussions with an additional partner group and expect to add partners who themselves serve an additional 2 million to 4 million U.S.
customers.
We are focused on creating a superior distribution partner network to sell the millions of merchants who use cash registers today.
Beyond that we're moving to additional countries in the immediate future with the same distribution strategy.
We expect this payments software platform running iOS along with our previously announced Lenovo agreements and a near-term Android implementation will give us a substantial distribution advantage to address the market for mPOS retail systems worldwide.
Last month we announced Way2ride a mobile software platform that is providing a new method of payments for taxi passengers first in New York City and others to follow by allowing them to upload payment card data preset tip amount to their smartphone check into a taxi securely transfer payment data and exit the taxi quickly when the ride is over.
Way2ride designed with the consumer in mind and built on VeriFone's mobile commerce platform will not only speed digital payments for taxi payers and other transportation applications but will also host third-party hailing apps using our payment infrastructure.
Earlier today we announced that Hailo an innovative hailing app is partnering with us to bring their capability to New York taxis with VeriFone as the hosting payment software platform.
Other apps will join them soon as hosted services in our platform.
In August we announced that our mobile commerce and payment system was selected by SNCF the operator of the French National Railroad which serves more than 100 million passengers a year.
This win is further evidence that our capability to bring innovative solutions in the market is increasing and a demonstration that we'll be a leader in our pay anywhere mobile world.
Additionally where we've invested sufficiently in our traditional terminals markets we're being rewarded with substantial business.
We're moving quickly towards the release of new core system to capture revenue opportunities in Turkey where government-mandated upgrade to wireless POS terminals with tax-reporting functionality will require re-terminalization of the entire market.
In the U.S.
we've gained a substantial share increase with a major retailer who manages more than 75 000 checkout lanes where we have won and shipped more than 90% of their purchases thus far in 2013.
This is in addition to being the partner of choice for 8 of the top 10 retailers in the U.S.
including names such as Costco Lowe's McDonald's Kroger and Safeway.
For these leading retailers execution must be flawless reliability functionality and integration are must-haves.
They note that we are delivering for them and rewarding us with their business.
Last quarter we announced that we won a tender of 450 000 terminals with Sberbank Russia's largest bank.
This agreement is enabling us to gain significant share in this key emerging market.
In Brazil we earned substantial system solutions business with one of the country's largest processors.
In the U.K.
we were named the global supplier to one of that country's large acquirers replacing the incumbent.
In both instances we were able to be victorious with the product offerings we had available.
As we develop and introduce a more robust product line starting mid next year we will see additional upside in these markets.
Our reception by these customers has been gratifying.
In India we renewed a substantial contract with the country's largest petroleum provider to enable and maintain electronic payment acceptance network across the country as part of this operator's fleet card program.
In our global taxi business we have a significant market opportunity as 1 of the 2 approved payment systems providers for the new class of green taxis that will cover Upper Manhattan and the New York City boroughs.
The city will license up to 6 000 additional taxis per year for the next 3 years increasing the addressable market for Greater New York alone from 13 000 to approximately 31 000 during that period.
Large U.S.
retailers in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 retail segments continue to offer demand for our MX 900 Series platform and our integrated solution which is creating real stickiness with our existing customers and winning new business from competitors.
Additionally merchant interest is high for our next generation of mobile acceptance platforms which enable large retailers to deploy mPOS solutions with the iPhone 5 and iPad Mini which is changing the shopping experience for many.
Also in the U.S.
we secured the U.S.
PIN pad business the large global quick service restaurants group as they prepare for the upcoming migration towards EMV.
We're also working with this customer on enabling acceptance of multiple wallet technologies across their more than 24 000 locations.
Next we continue to accelerate the growth of our payment-as-a-service offering.
We mentioned last quarter we closed our acquisition of ENZ of New Zealand on May 31.
We will leverage this acquisition to add VeriFone point service offerings in this market.
In Australia Greater Asia we're introducing VeriFone point services where we see demand for solutions that incorporate mobility devices software and support.
In August we launched VeriFone point services in North America which enables merchants and partners to purchase flexible software terminal and support packages on a subscription basis.
As U.S.
merchants continue to be mired in the evolving complexity of PCI-compliance and migration to EMV and the availability of many many mobile wallets and value-added services at the point-of-sale more and more see value in the point services offering.
In the Nordics VeriFone point continues to pace Europe we did saw the 24% year-over-year revenue growth for our all-in-one subscription services offering.
We will continue to explore payment-as-a-service opportunities in targeted countries.
Our rollout of this capability is accelerating and we'll reach the most receptive countries during the next year.
In a number of countries banks or other large acquirers may aspire to roll out some subscription-based services themselves.
But what we and they are seeing is a difficulty of getting large IT organizations to be responsive and to deliver this capability in a timely and/or a cost-effective manner.
This presents additional partnering options for us.
Finally we are seeing tremendous growth in our cloud-based data analytics soft offering.
VeriFone gateways provide secure transaction routing from merchants to their processors of choice and feature-rich management information reporting capabilities.
These gateways route 3 billion transactions per year and growing creating significant opportunity for VeriFone to provide actionable intelligence to its clients based on customer purchasing behaviors.
We're investing in our cloud-based analytics capability in order to expand in this area.
These are some of the indicators of our ability to compete effectively where we have focused and dedicated the appropriate resources.
As we move ahead to position ourselves for a sustained growth we're investing for the long-term with resources in R&amp;D and at the customer interface but we are also clearly focused on the short-term progress that we need to demonstrate.
We've taking meaningful steps to improve our balance sheet repaying $160 million of debt in the quarter.
Additionally we've amended our credit agreement to give us additional operational flexibility.
The opportunities for VeriFone are substantial.
We remain a leader in our industry with the assets and the people to capture opportunities.
From the global franchise of our core systems and payment-as-a-service initiatives to our diverse innovative approach to enabling new mobile interactions between merchant and consumer.
We have to do more work working quickly to restore the business to what we and you expect it to be.
Payments market is changing.
To capitalize on these opportunities in sum [ph] we are focused on 4 key areas.
Our core or network devices or network end points; number two subscription services; number three platform software; and number four data analytics.
VeriFone has 20 million network devices worldwide in 150 countries which are becoming more and more intelligent end points day by day.
These network devices are critical to the merchants for trillions of dollars in value exchange as well they're an important asset for us as major online players are moving into offline markets.
These 20 million network devices can become the distribution endpoint for targeted content such as ads and coupons.
Current example is our recently announced Groupon agreement.
We're in discussions with other partners regarding coupons and loyalty programs as well.
We'll build on the relevance afforded by our worldwide incumbency and position in the payment ecosystem to provide services and software solutions.
Many of the G20 countries have the positive conditions to make this subscription offering very attractive.
This is a high-growth market.
Our APIs will be open for partners who are looking to offer value-add applications with payment functionality to their customers.
And we're offering these APIs today to taxi and transportation providers.
Our next step we will offer this to petroleum and then c-store operators and then the hospitality industry.
We'll also host third-party developers looking to create applications that include varied payment functionality.
This is an emerging market.
As I mentioned earlier we're investing in cloud-based data analytics to build on the billions of transactions that we see every year.
We leverage this data aggregation capability and tie our developing mobile applications experience to this data mining service.
This is a high-value high-growth market.
Underpinning all of this is the broad adoption of mobility given its both real and perceived value to the consumer.
Mobility is a fundamental horizontal elements of all these areas of strategic focus from devices to mPOS to mobile apps to data both collected and analyzed.
Finally I would add that the board continues to work diligently towards a decision regarding a permanent CEO for VeriFone to comprehend the process and I am confident when finalized shortly that this will yield the right leader for the company's future.
In the meantime our work continues.
At this point I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague Marc Rothman CFO who will review of our results.
And I will come back after his remarks to provide some additional closing perspective.
Marc? Thanks Rich.
Consistent with the company's past practice we will be referring to certain income statement items on a non-GAAP basis.
Let me begin by highlighting our key financial metrics.
For the third quarter despite foreign exchange headwinds we reported net revenues of $418 million exceeding our guidance of $400 million for the quarter.
Our net revenues were down 15% from a year ago and down 3% sequentially.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.24 compared to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 a year ago and our results were $0.04 above our guidance.
Our GAAP earnings per share loss of $0.02 compares to a profit of $0.34 a year ago.
And our cash flow from operations this quarter was $49 million and our free cash flow was $31 million exceeding our non-GAAP net income of approximately $26 million.
Excluding large onetime items such as litigation settlements we expect to better align our free cash flow with our non-GAAP earnings going forward.
We are pleased with the results this quarter as we continue to focus our cash generation and better working capital management specifically accounts receivable and inventory.
I'd like to discuss briefly our regional results.
Our North American business recorded revenue of $116 million reflecting a decline of 16% compared to a year ago and 5% decline sequentially.
These changes were driven by several factors: First in our U.S.
multilane retail business we continue to see strong demand for our core integrated retail offering the MX 900 Series but this quarter's results reflect the year-over-year revenue reduction due to large rollouts that occurred in the third quarter fiscal 2012.
Over the past 12 months more than 30 existing Tier 1 customers have chosen VeriFone for their next-generation EMV ready solutions.
The same trend exists in the mid-tier with 10 existing customers migrating from the MX 800 to the MX 900 Series.
Additionally a number -- significant number of mid-tier customers have selected the MX 900 and will be rolling this platform out over the next several quarters.
We did experience lower sales in Canada as we further developed specific new products and address certification challenges that we are having for that market.
Our Petro business revenues were up slightly from last quarter but down from a year ago.
Last quarter we had discussed a significant site point-of-sale contract with one of our largest customers that we expect will generate approximately $15 million of revenue.
We will begin to see material benefit of this order during the next several quarters.
Partially offsetting these year-over-year decreases our U.S.
taxi business improved and benefited from expansions in markets including Chicago Las Vegas New Orleans and Philadelphia.
Turning now to Latin America.
Revenues for the third quarter were $70 million down 26% year-over-year and sequentially down 18%.
In Brazil as we have previously discussed we have experienced delays in the release of new products and certifications.
With increased focus in investments we continue to make progress in order to meet the growing demand in the market.
Another factor in our year-over-year decline is a drop in our Venezuela revenues as a result of currency control and political uncertainties.
Turning now to Europe the Middle East and Africa.
Revenues of $179 million were down 12% year-over-year and up 4% on a sequential basis.
As we discussed last quarter we are significantly investing in this market to enhance our product portfolio and rebuild our distribution channels.
Highlights in this region included our Russian business where sales were up significantly on a sequential basis benefiting from the large win from last quarter with one of Russia's largest banks.
Additionally in our point business in the Nordic region sales increased sequentially as we continued to drive additional customers to our value-added all-in-one payment as a service solution.
As Rich mentioned earlier all-in-one subscription service revenues were up 24% year-over-year.
Finally turning to Asia.
Our Q3 revenues of $53 million were down from $57 million a year ago primarily as a result of increased competition.
On a sequential basis sales were up 6% from $50 million and this resulted or we benefited from our New Zealand acquisition ENZ.
Additional information on organic and constant currency growth is included in today's press release as well.
Let us now turn to our system solutions and services revenue and margin mix.
Our system solution revenue was $251 million in Q3 down 28% from the prior year.
We are addressing these declines with reinvestment in our products and our product certification process.
On a sequential basis revenues were down 10% mainly reflecting reduced sales in Latin America primarily Brazil and in North America primarily in Canada.
Our service revenues were a record $167 million in Q3 an increase of 18% year-over-year and 11% increase sequentially.
Service revenues represented 40% of our total revenues in Q3 up 5 percentage points on a sequential basis.
Primary drivers of the revenue growth are the continued uptake for our value-added service offerings in our point business growth in the U.S.
taxi business for transactions and advertising and the acquisition of service businesses in New Zealand and France.
Overall our gross margin was approximately 41% a decrease of 140 basis points from our second quarter.
The decline in our system solutions gross margin as a percentage of revenue reflects higher inventory reserves required on certain slow-moving inventory.
These reserves impacted our system solutions' gross margin percentage by approximately 200 basis points.
Reducing our inventory levels and minimizing additional write-downs is an important priority.
Additionally as we expected we experienced lower gross margin in certain geographies as we continue to work to bring new products to market.
Our services gross margin increased from the second quarter of 2013 to 46.6% in the third quarter.
This sequential improvement primarily reflects the impact of increased payment-as-a-service revenue and higher taxi advertising revenues.
Let me now turn and discuss operating expenses.
During the quarter operating expenses were $127 million an increase of $12 million over the prior quarter as we increase our investments in product development sales and customer interface activities and related back-office support.
The $12 million increase also includes the impact of acquisitions made during the period.
Now let's take a look at VeriFone's balance sheet.
We are pleased with our progress this quarter on improving the balance sheet and our increased focus on cash management.
Cash flow is a top priority for the VeriFone team.
Our cash balance of $309 million reflects the repayment and deleveraging of $160 million of debt an investment of $65 million previously announced for acquisitions and the addition of $31 million of free cash flow generated during this quarter.
Our net debt is now down to $810 million down $102 million from this time a year ago.
I'd like to take a moment to discuss our deleveraging actions in Q3.
As I said we paid down $160 million or 13% of our total debt.
Most of these funds for the $160 million came from repatriated international cash.
These repatriations were executed with minimal tax costs.
And I would classify the repatriations in 3 categories: one dividends to U.S.
from our foreign entities that are not subject to tax because they are branches for U.S.
tax purposes; two repayment of intercompany debt owed to our U.S.
entity and three transfer of foreign funds deemed returns of capital which are not subject to tax.
We will continue to bring back cash from abroad to pay down debt and cover needed U.S.
outflows.
As Rich mentioned in July we amended the credit agreement for a onetime fee of approximately $1.2 million which included the extension of a maximum limit for the leverage ratio at 3.75 through the end of fiscal year '14 giving us more financial latitude.
We are in compliance with the credit agreements to financial covenants details of which are included in a new schedule posted on our website at ir.verifone.com.
Continuing with the good progress on our balance sheet our days sales outstanding improved 8 days to 58 days and our accounts receivable balance declined to $269 million.
This improvement is due primarily to better sales linearity additional focus and a more coordinated effort amongst our sales and collections team.
Our inventory of $172 million decreased by $9 million and inventory measured as days of supply decreased 3 days to 64 days.
We are focused on making continuous process improvements around the demand planning activities to optimize inventory levels and improve our overall product costs.
In addition our initiatives on centralizing procurement activities continues to gain momentum which we expect will help us optimize cost further consolidate vendors and better managed terms.
Our accounts payable ended the quarter at $112 million a decrease of $39 million quarter-over-quarter.
Days payable outstanding for the quarter decreased to 41 days.
The decline reflects lower receipts this quarter on lower sales and reduced inventory levels.
We expect our days payable to fluctuate between low 40s to the low 50s going forward for the near term based upon timing of receipts during the quarter and our current payment terms.
We are focused on initiatives to improve our cash conversion cycles and our cash flow metrics going forward.
Turning now to cash flow.
In the third quarter of 2013 cash flow from operations as I said was $49 million and our free cash flow was $31 million for the quarter which was slightly higher than our non-GAAP net income.
And during this period we invested $18 million in capital expenditures including $10 million on revenue-generating assets mainly systems for our payment-as-a-service model and our taxi business.
CapEx was lower than planned due to timing and focus of our investments.
Let me now turn to our guidance.
We expect non-GAAP revenues in Q4 to be in the range of $418 million to $422 million.
We expect our non-GAAP earnings to be $0.25 per share and we expect free cash flow to be approximately $25 million before payment of the shareholder of litigation settlement and negative $35 million including the settlement assuming the payment happens during the fourth quarter.
Consistent with our direction last quarter we would expect Q1 2014 to reflect modest sequential improvement in both revenue and earnings per share over our Q4 guidance.
For fiscal year 2014 we expect continued sequential increases in both revenue and earnings per share each quarter and we'll provide more guidance on our financial metrics during our year-end earnings call.
Now let me thank you and turn the call back over to Rich.
Thanks Marc.
I'd like to provide some closing comments before your questions.
We're pleased with the progress we're making.
Transformation effort that is underway at VeriFone is broad.
We're moving ahead smartly.
2014 we continue to expect a more robust pipeline of wireless and mobile products as well as increased traction in our payment-as-a-service initiative software platforms and our data analytics.
By the second half of 2014 we expect VeriFone will be on its way to a new growth path.
Several messages I'd like you to take away from this conversation: Our plan is working the business is stabilizing but there is more work to do.
With 20 million network devices worldwide our incumbency provide a solid foundation for our future expansion.
Leveraging this foundation we are strategically positioning the company for long-term value creation through the continued growth of our core business our payment-as-a-service initiatives our open software platform and our growing data analytics capability.
We're a leader in this industry with a solid foundation and great people.
We're executing on our plan and focused on the opportunities which we will seize more fully by midyear 2014.
And at this point I'd like to open us up to Q&amp;A.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will be coming from the line of John T.
Williams with UBS.
Research Division</strong> I had a couple of quick ones.
So Marc you had mentioned quickly that you're currently having present tense some certification issues in Canada.
I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more info on what you meant by that? And then the second question is on CapEx.
I know you mentioned that the quarterly number was lower than planned for the third quarter.
And I was just hoping you could give us some sense of what the fourth quarter number should look like.
Should we see that catch-up or is it generally going to run at a lower rate than you had originally planned 3 months ago? John thanks.
Let me cover CapEx and Rich will make some comments on Canada.
On the CapEx as you've mentioned $18 million for the quarter was lower than our planned expectation of $23 million to $25 million.
Part of that was timing and an increased focus on just the investment discipline.
I would expect with that downtick in Q3 that we will run around $25 million in the fourth quarter.
And that's what we're factoring into the free cash flow guidance that I provided.
Substantial amount of that again will be for revenue-generating assets.
As far as Canada is concerned we were not battle-ready in terms of things that we've done in the past couple of years.
Customer reaction was not positive and then we came foreward to get into the certification queue.
We were late to that queue.
We missed the cycle.
And our good competitor our primary competitor took advantage of that as one would which had them get a big move up in terms of business vis-à-vis us.
But we are back on top of it now.
We have well-developed rock-solid products.
We're getting into certification queue.
And over the next 2 quarters we should see a full product line available for us in Canada in terms of portable and mPOS devices.
So we missed the cycle by our execution.
Research Division</strong> So just to be clear Rich this was more of a legacy sort of lingering issue than something that's come up in the last few month? This sounds like an old issue that you're still dealing with.
An old issue with a long tail.
And we are finally getting it under control now.
And that's what has been plaguing us and understandably the customers voted with their feet and they move to someone else who was seen in the absence of our inability to deliver a product at the right time well-baked to go with someone else.
But the conversations that we've maintained with our customers informs us that as we finally get our act together here as we are that the opportunity is there for us to begin once again getting good business volume in Canada.
But we didn't do a good job for a while.
Research Division</strong> If I could just sneak one last one in on EMEA.
I know you talked about the issues there last quarter how much of the improvement -- is a little bit better than we expected.
How much of the improvement there was Middle East versus Europe? Could you just give us a little bit of direction on that? Thanks John.
So in Europe Middle East and Africa the results in Middle East North Africa were relatively comparable to Q2.
And a significant part of the increase in Europe quarter-on-quarter John related to our success in Russia on the contract that both Rich and I highlighted with Sberbank.
And lastly the UM acquisition that we closed this quarter also contributed to the increase sequentially.
The next question is from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> It's actually Roman Leal in for Julio.
I guess just a follow-up on the question in Canada and maybe we can group Canada and Brazil together more on how we should think about the cadence for the trajectory of revenue and business volume there.
Should we think about maybe 2 more quarters both Canada and Brazil before you kind of lap the initial step down with some customers there? So maybe after 2 quarters the comps get easier.
First is there another way of thinking about the comps? And then secondly do you have some visibility on when some of these customers potentially come back to market with some sizable orders? Thanks Roman.
First of all I wouldn't lump them together.
First dealing with Canada.
And now that we've addressed all of our issues and we moved into the cycle for certification we'll get through that.
And then the latency period between working with the customer and deployment that's probably a couple of quarters.
I think that's a reasonable statement.
In Brazil a little bit different in that we are still able to sell products in Brazil.
We've got a very good market share position.
Other major competitor took some shift share from us in the recent past as we didn't have a full portfolio.
But as we have indicated we're investing to address that but it is not the same situation.
It wasn't as long duration as we have had in Canada.
And the products are coming online for Brazil by the end of this year first quarter of next year and fully by midyear next year.
So it is a lot more products that are specific for the Brazilian marketplace in form factor in functionality at the request of our customers.
And -- but honestly the relationship remain strong and they're just waiting for us to -- not patiently but waiting for us to deliver on the promises and the expectations that they have.
And that will occur on a step-by-step basis starting soon and probably reaching its point of full competitiveness by midyear next year.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
And then just on the balance sheet you made some good progress there.
Anything you can share with us in terms of what the near-term goals are maybe in terms of how much more debt you like to pay down or where you'd like to get to in terms of leverage anything that would be helpful.
Thanks again Roman.
So this is Marc on the balance sheet.
And yes we're pleased with the progress we made and certainly looking forward to making more progress.
On the deleveraging side just to recap $160 million from this quarter brings the debt down the gross debt to around $1.1 billion.
And we have the flexibility to pay down additional debt.
Right now we're planning to pay down at a minimum the amortized requirements which double to roughly $25 million a quarter next year.
And we will look for the right opportunities continue to at least pay down the revolver.
We don't have an intention to further pay down the term A and the term B at this point except as it relates to the amortization.
But we'll be managing the revolver down as it makes sense.
Your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Nice to see that perhaps the bottom is in here I think a lot of people will be relieved.
Rich not to in any way minimize the efforts and the refocus of management on execution and certification and so forth but is it safe to conclude or reiterate with you that as you make progress in key markets especially in services that this remains a global duopoly primarily and that any significant improvement outside of just intrinsic market growth that VeriFone can make its go-to-market execution more effectively be 0-sum gain in other words you call back some of the share you currently lost in key markets like Latin America I guess a little bit in North America too? Thanks Andrew.
Probably a longer conversation than one could have at this moment in a Q&amp;A session.
But I see the world a little differently.
If you were to think of the taxonomy as only about terminals you might draw that conclusion that it's a 0-sum gain.
But every day you and your colleagues and many others remind us that the world of payment is changing.
In fact one would describe it as a major changes in the way in which people are thinking about payments how they're using payments the intersection of payments and commerce et cetera the application of information in different ways.
Google knowing what you're thinking by your search.
We know what you're doing by your purchases.
There are so many things that are changing that actually the element of the value chain that is payments is moving around and we are not only relying on our tremendous position as is another major competitor in our incumbency but as I pointed out looking at subscription services looking at software platforms and mobility software and looking at data analytics and the value that that implies to our merchant customers and partners as an expanded opportunity for us.
So it is beyond the notion of 2 major players which is a factual statement of a duopoly by virtue of market shares.
But it's much more opportunity for us as these new elements move in terms of more importance throughout payments.
So that's why we are optimistic about the growth prospects as these new S curves come on over the next few years giving us a chance to have a more robust future while we fix the fundamental issues that have plagued us over the recent past in our core business.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> That's really helpful color.
You once again demonstrated it on a pretty simple figure.
It actually...
I'm sorry.
I wasn't quite finished [ph].
I apologize.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> It actually begs another question.
To the extent that services outperformed this quarter relative to system sales is some of that a shift in the business? In other words is more of your revenue being recognized ratably as services and less from hardware or system sales? Or is it too early to make to draw that conclusion? There were some of that but that's not the big issue.
This is not some situation where the reduction in systems numbers and device numbers is down in some measurable meaningful way because of services.
The rate of growth may be a little bit impacted but it's not much.
The real issue is as we have told you last quarter and this quarter is we didn't do a good job.
We didn't invest enough.
We didn't invest properly.
We had some issues about it and we let another good competitor take ship share away from us.
In the recent past they benefited from us at this point in time.
We're fixing that.
But we're also looking to the opportunities in these additional spaces.
I find it quite interesting that we're able to win a mobile e-commerce business in France for the French National Railroad based upon our software.
I was very pleased to see that.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And one last quick one.
Marc could you take a stab for us at normalized profitability? One of the callouts I noted was 200 basis points of inventory reserves.
I assume that normalizes to some lower level over time but are you prepared to kind of give us a sense of what you think your long-term sustainable non-GAAP EBIT margin might look like? Let me clarify the comment I made on the gross margins and the adjustment for inventory reserves is actually in the non-GAAP results okay? So the 40 -- approximately 41% of gross margin that's included in the non-GAAP results and the $0.24 per share reflects that write-down.
It's not called out.
In fact the non-GAAP callouts this quarter are as low as they've been in at least the last 6 quarters.
So we are working very hard and very diligently to minimize the amount of charges that go through the non-GAAP results.
And you see that Andrew in our cash flow performance which I am trying to tie the 2 in terms of improved earnings cash flow free cash flow being $31 million and the non-GAAP earnings being $26 million.
And it's reflective in part by the fact that we have lower non-GAAP callouts.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Any thoughts on long-term margins? With respect to the long-term margins I would expect it to continue to sequentially improve upwards.
We've laid out the OpEx framework.
We did $127 million and we expect that to go up slightly in the next quarter and thereafter.
And I would expect over time as we work through some of our inventory our slower-moving inventory and our competitive issues with our product our gross margins will improve as well.
And those 2 things coupled with the revenue leverage will result in operating margin improvement from the current levels.
I would add one more piece on that to amplify the comment which is the number of customers that a dialogue has been developing around these major banking institutions thinking differently about how they interact with a company like us.
Historically it's been -- you had to be a good supplier deliver on time on price good quality.
Now a number of players who must be having let's say industry conversations are saying you are being seen differently.
You're being seen as a technology partner as we think differently about our strategies.
That is a great change in the conversation because it lets us in earlier to their thinking helps us in our ideation for products and services reduces the latency period from that to introduction and gives us a chance to show the real value that we're offering in addition to a device.
So that is a bit of a change in terms of the conversation we're having -- happening these days.
And quite honestly we're quite satisfied quite gratified with that change.
The next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> Just a few quick questions if you don't mind.
Just first off could you size the revenue loss due to product or certification gaps this quarter? I know you've mentioned Canada but I didn't actually hear any sizing of the impacts.
I think it's reflective Tien-tsin in the fact that the revenues declined significantly from the second quarter the $430 million down to $417.5 million.
You can attribute a substantial portion of that to the product and service -- the product challenge that we've highlighted.
I would say that it is specifically in the 2 or 3 countries that we've highlighted Brazil I think we've covered that pretty well in detail.
And in Canada as well.
And we're making progress in parts of Western Europe.
But we still have some product gaps that we're working through.
So I would suggest that a significant portion of the change quarter-on-quarter related to product gaps and it's a little bit more than that because the acquisitions and the increase in our service offerings.
So I hope that color could allow you to get to a reasonable number.
Research Division</strong> No we can extrapolate from that.
I mean I'm asking because just trying to get a sense over the next 2 quarters as that gap narrows what kind of revenues we could assume comes back.
That's the crux of the question but that works.
Let me add to that in terms of looking.
We're being gated in terms of our estimates.
We expect that we'll have improvements that will be more meaningful towards the second half of next year when we have a more full and robust upgrade to the product offering.
So we've signaled that the sequential improvements will be modest and that's consistent with our previous guidance except it's on a better baseline relative to our results today.
Research Division</strong> Right it makes sense.
The multi-lane you guys still doing well there.
I know a tough comp but I guess my bigger picture question is just can you give us some sense on the shipments with what's the -- whatever attach rate or penetration rate for EMV and NFC in the U.S.
and maybe outside of the U.S.? Sounds like EMV is actually still moving the needle.
Well EMV is just a part of the decision process that the people are folding in to their normal upgrade cycles at this point in time.
The processors are doing it early acquirers are now ready certain merchants are doing it every time they get to do a new rollout of certain offices et cetera.
I don't see it as a dramatic change.
I see it as a benefit to us and a sense -- creating a bit of a sense of urgency in terms of the preparation time but I don't see it as a step-function change in terms of what's going on.
Just step-by-step quarter-by-quarter as we get closer to the dates you'll see more and more.
And the timing is good for us because we'll have a more complete product line of that time too.
So I like that.
Research Division</strong> Any risk of that system sales get delayed as a result of some of the Durbin 2.0 stuff obviously with the judge striking it down and you make it to [ph] be more uncertainty around whether that EMV should still stick with those deadlines given there could be some routing rule changes et cetera? I know it's pretty new.
It's not showing up in your numbers.
But we've been thinking about this potential how real could that be in your view? First I don't see any at all.
Second I don't think I'm qualified to comment on Durbin or friend of the court filings to try to block the judges rulings.
That's too metaphysical for me.
So I'm going to deal with customers needs engineering resources and we're all managing the business.
And if we'll only be focused on those things we'll do our part.
Research Division</strong> Okay fair enough.
Last one I promise.
Just the -- I like the comments around the open software platform et cetera.
As you're thinking about those comments in relation to what Visa had said at their Investor Day around the Visa-ready partner program where they're going to create a path to certification I guess for innovators focused on hardware and software which I thought was a change to create potentially more competition but also more innovation.
So how do you think those 2 things coexist? I think the incumbency message is right from a VeriFone standpoint but there's obviously a lot of moving pieces.
How do you think those 2 things coexist if you follow my question? To the extent that I do follow it I tried to study a little bit of history.
And most of the time I believe on average over time the moat theory of defense didn't work out too well.
So rather than embracing the fact that incumbency and control gives you comfort security and is [ph] a moat I'd rather go out engaged and bring in the considerable value from the very very bright engineers around the industry who wish to play in this value chain and have them develop on our platforms and have us be a partner going forward.
And given our share position our incumbency especially in the U.S.
where so much innovation is taking place we are the most attractive partner in the world to work with in the U.S.
because they can reach so many people.
So why not really think about it differently? And that took about 10 days to figure that out.
And we are committed to it.
We're on our way.
We're already beginning to shift POS-based operating system software products.
And we'll have a whole new hardware platform as well when the tape-out occurs in the chips in about 15 months which is great performance and allows us to do chipsets reductions et cetera cost reductions.
But we are already shipping and we're already opening ourselves up.
We got the APIs publishing and we're going to start providing in things that we didn't know how to do previously which is developer support in a more professional way.
I think that makes them more -- provides an easier way for them to go to market and makes us more valuable to the end customers.
The final question will come from the line of Wayne Johnson Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Good news on the top line so well done there.
Could you give us an update on kind of the outlook by region how you expect that to unfold in North America Latin America EMEA Asia? That will be helpful.
Thank you Wayne.
This is Marc.
Let me give you some information on the regional outlook for Q4 off of Q3.
So for North America we are guiding and modeling towards a slight improvement.
And that slight improvement is coming primarily from multi-lane retail and we see progress in Q4 from Q3.
In Asia-Pac I expect -- we expect it to be relatively flat off of our Q3 numbers.
And in EMEA with $179 million in Q3 we now expect some slight improvement in EMEA as well.
And I highlighted Russia during my comments.
Offsetting those improvements and [ph] the balance in Asia-Pac are the headwinds in Latin America.
So when we look at Brazil in particular and we continue to navigate through the various competitive dynamics and factoring in the current FX headwinds we expect Latin America to be down from the Q3 numbers.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And then is there going to be a range on how much is it going to be down sequentially? I think I'll let you guys do a little bit of the modeling there.
The $417.5 million that we have for Q3 we just to highlight again the range we got it to $418 million at the low end to $422 million.
So Latin America will have some impact on the upside that we see in North America and Europe...
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
That's a...
I'm sorry.
Please go ahead.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> All right that's helpful direction.
Could you size Canada for us? As part of North America what in absolute dollar value terms how big is it how big was it in the most recent quarter how big was it a year ago? The overall market is what I'll comment on.
The overall market in Canada is reported to be around $50 million to $60 million a year.
And one would argue that we should have a substantial piece of that.
And recently we have not.
There's good proximity to where we have a very substantial market position in United States.
Many of the same customers are present in Canada as are in the United States.
We do well with them in the U.S.
And the same customers the same buyers have rewarded our good competitors with business in Canada because of our own personal failures.
We believe that by rectifying our own internal problems that we'll be able to substantially improve the position in Canada once we address that.
So...
And just to comp it to last year.
So last year we had our relative share of the market fair share of the market.
And obviously given the product challenges that we've had and we're working on that's been cut sizably.
If I were a customer and you're satisfying me well with good products security quality reliability and timeliness and decent pricing in the U.S.
I would award you the business.
If the same conditions were true in Canada I'd probably award you the business it makes it easier for me.
And then the same customers are making a different decision in Canada.
And quite honestly I understand it.
I don't like it but I understand it.
So fix our problem the dynamic will change.
Wayne thank you very much.
If I may just make a closing statement.
I think earlier it may have Andrew who said that it's good to see the bottom and we concur.
We feel good about the way things are beginning to change.
Economists talk about leading economic indicators.
We have our own leading indicators.
We have been defensive for the past several quarters maybe as many as 3 quarters in the conversations with our customers because we have not been outstanding in servicing them and serving them.
But the network of conversation with the customers has begun to change.
And for us the first manifestation of that is that conversation and the way in which the customer-facing organization the engineers and the salespeople are able to hold their heads up and to deal with the customers.
That is not a sales forecast.
That is not a business plan but is a leading indicator of how things are changing that is followed by investing that's followed by plans and programs and execution and that's why we're saying as we're seeing this turn we see it step-by-step quarter-by-quarter our competence is increasing the rate of change is increasing and we expect over the next several to 3 quarters that we will be back in fighting shape to be able to not only build on our installed base our incumbency and our relationships but also add a lot of value with these 3 other areas that I mentioned in services and software and information to build a more robust business.
We thank you for your continued support your insightful questions and we will continue to share with you.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference.
We thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Paul Galant CEO of VeriFone.
Thank you Doug and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.
It is my great pleasure to be here at VeriFone on my first earnings call as Chief Executive Officer.
Now before I share my initial observations about our company and discuss actions that we're taking to improve our business I want to let you know how excited I am to be leading VeriFone at this time.
VeriFone is a company that really matters in payments and we will play an increasingly important role in enabling commerce for our clients.
In our 32-year history this entrepreneurial company of 5 700 talented people have served its clients in 150 countries and has built a footprint of 20-plus-million hardware terminals.
Taken together VeriFone's terminals combined with our numerous software and services solutions collectively power approximately 14 million merchant locations their websites and mobile apps that together capture more than 70 billion consumer transactions totaling approximately $4 trillion annually.
We are #1 -- or #2 in nearly all the markets that we serve and VeriFone terminals process approximately 40% of the world's consumer-initiated physical card-based transactions.
Any way you look at it VeriFone is a tremendous platform and our deep client relationships position us well to further lead the evolution that is already underway in payments and commerce.
We are witnessing and in some cases driving changes in business models in technology in consumer behavior and benefiting from increased activity and investment by merchants and payments companies.
VeriFone is the physical point of consumer and merchant interaction as a convergence of electronic payments digital commerce predictive analytics and mobility starts to play out.
VeriFone's position in consumer-initiated card transaction will enable us to play a significantly important role in closing the loop with contextual marketing digital advertising couponing loyalty and social media.
This expansion beyond the sandbox of plastic cards and payment terminals is a very good thing for VeriFone.
The power and versatility of a consumer smartphone ecosystem needs to be matched by the power and versatility of the future merchant point-of-sale environment.
That is the bigger sandbox in which VeriFone will excel.
I believe that the growth of payments volume will continue to accelerate and digitize and the way in which consumers and merchants engage will continue to rapidly evolve.
There are only a handful of companies that can enable and capitalize on these macro changes at scale in the way that VeriFone can and there are only a few companies that enjoy the breadth and depth of VeriFone's market position.
More money and more attention is being paid to the payments industry than in any time in modern history and I believe this will create a positive decade of opportunity for VeriFone and our clients and partners.
Now throughout my career in both the wholesale and consumer payments industries I have had the privilege of leading complex global organizations through periods of industry change and disruption.
In each case my teams and I unified businesses under a single global brand dedicated to commercial innovation and client service.
In each case the key to success was relentless streamlining and simplification of the operating environment and transforming the internal culture to be focused on partnering with clients to understand their challenges and prioritize the execution of their opportunities.
These partnerships with clients produced innovative solutions at scale that generated sustainable economic growth and real performance.
Businesses that I have run in the past evolved from being vendors that received RFPs to being trusted partners that received their client's first call.
Those same businesses also evolved from reading about major innovation announcements to making those announcements in partnership with the world's most innovative companies.
An exciting example of how VeriFone is making this transition is our recently announced program with our partners at American Express.
For the first time ever New York City taxi passengers can now use their American Express card membership reward points instead of cash to pay for their taxi fares.
This new program already operating in 7 000 New York City taxis begins to paint the picture of the potential for VeriFone's network devices to enable new commerce and help close the loop and deliver precise and real-time measurable return on loyalty marketing and advertising programs.
As we look ahead VeriFone solutions can on a global basis enable our clients to unlock their consumers' trillions of unused rewards points to pay not only for infrequent luxury goods but also to pay for everyday items such as cab rides gas meals groceries clothing et cetera.
As any company with a rewards program will tell you the key is to engage and remind their consumers as often as possible of the tangible value that they get by using their card or shopping at their brand.
Ultimately we believe that these types of simple practical and valuable commerce enablement services operated at scale and without a lot of dependencies I may add will deepen our client relationships and create value for our shareholders.
Now let me turn to our Q4 overview.
I think as you can see from our Q4 results VeriFone continues to make progress towards driving business performance improving our client relationships addressing product challenges and strengthening our balance sheet.
This focus has enabled us to walk the walk and deliver results that exceeded our guidance for the top and bottom line as well as guidance for our free cash flow.
In addition to exceeding our financial guidance for the quarter VeriFone continues to capture new business and renew existing business with some of the world's most influential retail brands and financial institutions.
Let me cover just a few of them.
In the United States Sephora and American Girl selected VeriFone's next-generation integrated and mobile payment solutions over those of our competitors to drive commerce in their stores.
VF Corp.
has agreed to implement our full payment-as-a-service solution including mobile across 6 of its brands including The North Face.
Under Armour successfully rolled out VeriFone's newest mobile point-of-sale device for their iTouch 5 just in time for the holidays.
And Chick-fil-A is integrating VeriFone mobile solutions for iPads to facilitate line busting inside and outside of its restaurants.
To be sure this is already not your father's [ph] terminal company.
In many of these recent wins we are supplementing our clients' existing counter-based VeriFone terminals with our mobile our digital marketing and our full services solutions.
Now moving north in Canada Moneris the country's largest payment services provider will roll out new VeriFone devices in 2014.
Now you may recall we struggled with having certified products to sell in Canada in the past.
Well I'm happy to report that we are now full steam ahead.
In China VeriFone continues to grow with successful business relationships with China PnR the country's third largest payments processor.
Here we're expanding beyond maintenance of the existing terminal fleet to now include delivery of our next generation of wireless devices.
Further demonstrating the progress that VeriFone has made in bringing our house to order and delivering the products that our clients need in Brazil VeriFone is now winning proposals to deliver contactless and portable devices to our major clients in this very important market.
By the same token in France Bouygues Telecom one of the country's largest mobile operators has selected VeriFone's gateway services our helpdesk services and devices to better manage transactions across the physical mobile and eCommerce points-of-sale for its retail stores.
In Egypt the country's Ministry of Finance has selected VeriFone devices to power the electronification of the country's entire gasoline and petroleum retail market.
And these are just a few examples of the deals that we've won this quarter and the great things happening around the world for VeriFone and for our clients.
Finally I'd like to discuss the process that the management team and I are now undertaking to steer VeriFone to become the company we want to be.
Look I hope you can tell that I'm excited about the future but I'm also crystal clear that we must do some heavy lifting to fix certain foundational aspects of our business and we must continue to build credibility with our clients our partners and our shareholders.
In my first 78 days at VeriFone I've spent the vast majority of my time with our clients with our suppliers employees leadership team and our Board.
I could tell you that I've seen a lot and I've heard a lot of direct feedback.
The bottom line is in the last couple of years we at VeriFone simply did not live up to our expectations and certainly not to our potential.
Before we can fully build our future we need to fix and strengthen our foundation.
The first steps to fixing our foundation are to better manage our brand communicate a clear business strategy rationalize and streamline our products improve the design the look the feel and quality of our products and of course execute our business with more discipline and accountability.
We've already started this work and are now refining a one VeriFone vision a strategy and an execution plan that will help us achieve our objectives.
At a high level our vision is to be the most trusted and innovative terminal global payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement company.
Our strategy is to make it easy for our clients to connect our terminals and solutions to a secure platform capable of hosting VeriFone and third-party developed services.
And our execution plan is to improve the way we run our core hardware and software business globalize our payment-as-a-service offering and significantly innovate in the area of commerce enablement.
Now we start this journey by fixing the basics and we've identified 3 initiatives to achieve this objective.
First we will analyze and rationalize our product portfolio to focus on products that our clients want and where we can provide sustainable market leadership.
Second we will significantly enhance our global research and development organization and bring far greater discipline to the way we execute.
And third we will improve our cost structure to help support our innovation agenda and create long-term financial benefits.
Let me discuss each of these initiatives in slightly more detail beginning with portfolio rationalization.
As a result of our significant acquisitions VeriFone has an extensive number of products and platforms some of which simply overlapped.
As it stands today the company is too decentralized and operates too much like a collection of regional businesses and acquired companies that must now be better leveraged and integrated to realize the full benefits of these assets.
We are now intensely focused on starting the integration to improve returns on the investments that we've already made.
Through our portfolio rationalization efforts we are streamlining the number of products and part numbers in VeriFone's existing global portfolio in order to simplify our engineering program and better allocate our investments and resources to their highest and best use.
We will leverage a dispassionate and rigorous approach using a single data-driven model for product management on a global basis.
This means product priorities and innovation work will be analyzed consistently and stack ranked on a global basis before it gets executed.
In other words we're going to stop spreading the peanut butter thinly and evenly across the bread.
Furthermore our senior leaders will have end-to-end visibility and ownership and will be more directly accountable for their work as measured by their individual scorecards.
To lead this initiative I'm pleased to say that we recently hired Bill Nelson as EVP of Product Management and Services.
Bill has led sales.
He's led marketing product and services across management functions at global organizations such as SunGard EMC AT&amp;T and most recently at Nuance.
I'm confident that Bill working in concert with the management team will achieve a more focused and data-driven product marketing and management function.
Turning now to our second initiative R&amp;D execution.
To reach the next level of success VeriFone must reengineer and improve our R&amp;D operations and technology capabilities.
Too often we have experienced delays in production and product certification in certain markets and have not done a good enough job in on-time delivery and quality assurance.
During the last few months we have begun to really peel the onion to reinvent and expand our R&amp;D efforts significantly particularly in some of the markets where we simply lack certified products.
We expect new fully certified on-time and high-quality products to come to these -- to markets and then following quarter-by-quarter throughout fiscal year 2014.
The improvement of R&amp;D capabilities will center on 3 areas.
Let me run through those: Number one we will reduce complexity within our R&amp;D organization and manage it as a global organization responsible for technology operations and innovation; secondly we will reduce the number of overlapping and inefficient hardware and software platforms.
This process is greatly informed by our portfolio rationalization initiative that will help us reduce the complexity of our existing portfolio and help us to better select future products and services; and finally three we will reduce new product cycle times by improving the efficiency of our product development our certification and quality testing processes.
Transforming R&amp;D at VeriFone is a table stakes activity that will take time and the right leadership.
To address the latter we I'm very pleased to say recruited Alok Bhanot who recently joined the company as EVP and Chief Technology Officer.
I've had the pleasure of working with Alok in the past and know him to be a proven innovator and leader driving disciplined execution across global operations and technology at organizations such as PayPal eBay and Visa.
Before coming to VeriFone he founded and was CEO of Inkiru a predictive analytics company that was recently acquired by Walmart.
I'm confident that under Alok's leadership this transformation will be successful and will lead to a more effective and innovative R&amp;D capability at VeriFone.
Now the third initiative is to improve and get far more leverage out of our cost structure.
VeriFone's current operating model has created an overlap in the production of our products and services.
Historically the company has been highly decentralized with different regions and power to make their own product roadmaps their own operating standards and employ their own procedures.
We're changing this approach by standardizing common processes and technologies so that we can better benefit from VeriFone's impressive global scale.
Rest assured that driving to common does not equal becoming less nimble and flexible to serving our clients.
Intelligent process design creates global scale and leverage and yet leaves last mile flexibility in the hands of our people closest to local markets and to our clients.
We will be applying a more formalized and disciplined global process to our expense space that creates better alignment between spend and value creation.
We're developing consistent company-wide processes; we're consolidating our management system; and building a culture accountability that will create greater efficiency and improve our speed of execution.
Ultimately this will increase our ability to service the unique requirements of our clients across the countries where we operate.
We're breaking down the VeriFone regional and divisional mindset in order to operate better as one global company and that is a big priority for me.
Through our cost optimization initiative we're starting to deliver more centralized shared services in our back-office functions and we'll continue our focus on centralized purchase activities.
We will transition from disparate management systems to common tools that enable us to manage the business consistently across the globe and we will be redoubling our focus on efficiency to maximize all available resources and streamline our company to support our drive for global growth.
I expect benefits to our cost structure from some efficiency work to begin to materialize towards the latter part of fiscal year 2014 and I expect to begin to see the more significant benefits of streamlining our processes starting in fiscal year 2015.
I'm also happy to say that Marc Rothman our CFO is spearheading this effort for the company.
In conclusion I'm confident that we've identified both our challenges and the changes we need to make in order for VeriFone to be a great terminal company a great payment-as-a-service provider and an innovative enabler of commerce that our clients turn to.
As CEO I'm committed to being transparent about the road ahead and the steps we are taking.
I'm confident that VeriFone is in the right space and positioned well to benefit from the coming decade of evolution in payments and commerce.
As you've heard we're establishing internal financial and operational scorecards to which our entire organization will now be held accountable.
This will ensure steady progress of achievement of the 3 initiatives I outlined for you today and the execution of our vision and strategy.
The future here is bright and I'm confident that we will create value for our stakeholders.
Now before handing the call over to Marc I would like to address our 2014 financial outlook.
For fiscal year 2014 we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.77 billion to $1.8 billion and our earnings per share in the range of $1.35 to $1.40.
The EPS outlook reflects continued investments to enable the strategy that I've outlined.
I will now turn it over to Marc for a review of our fourth quarter financial results and additional details on our guidance.
Marc? Thanks Paul.
Let me now provide commentary on our financial and operating results.
Consistent with the company's past practice we will be referring to certain financial statement information on a non-GAAP basis.
We are pleased with the progress on our key financial metrics.
For the fourth fiscal quarter we reported net revenues of $432 million exceeding our guidance of $418 million to $422 million.
Our net revenues were down 12% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.27 compared to non-GAAP earnings per share last quarter of $0.24 and $0.76 a year ago.
In the fourth quarter we recorded a non-cash charge of $242 million to record a [ph] valuation reserve against our U.S.
deferred tax assets.
This was necessary as a result of our fiscal 2013 U.S.
tax loss that created a 3-year cumulative loss.
Our U.S.
subsidiary results include our corporate interest expense and litigation costs both of which contributed significantly to the loss I just discussed.
Although these losses do raise uncertainty about the realization of our tax assets we continue to have the ability to use these assets to offset future U.S.
taxable income and therefore minimize U.S.
cash tax payments for the foreseeable future.
As a result our GAAP loss per share of $2.26 included $2.21 related to this non-cash tax charge.
I would like to now briefly discuss our regional results.
Our North America business recorded revenues of $124 million reflecting an 8% increase sequentially.
Our results reflect several factors.
In our U.S.
multi-lane retail business we continued to see strong demand for our core integrated retail offering the MX 900 Series.
This represented another significant quarter of customer retention as well as competitive takeaways.
7 additional existing customers have committed to rolling out the MX 900 Series and we have added 7 new customers choosing our solution.
This quarter's results do reflect a tough year-over-year comparison as last year's fourth quarter included large rollouts with several top 100 U.S.
retailers.
As discussed last quarter our sales in the Canadian market have been impacted as we continue to develop specific new products and address product certifications.
Our focus and investments have led to improvement and we are pleased with our recent wins in Canada as Paul just highlighted.
Our petro business revenues were also up slightly from last quarter but down a year ago.
We previously discussed a significant site point-of-sale contract with one of our largest customers that we expect to generate incremental revenues over the coming quarters as these products are deployed and installed at client locations.
Also in North America our U.S.
taxi business grew sequentially and we benefited from expansion in markets including New York Chicago Las Vegas and New Orleans.
Let me now turn to Latin America.
Our revenues for the fourth quarter was $71 million and on a sequential basis were slightly higher by 1%.
We continued to make progress on the development of new products and certifications for the Brazilian market.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues of $180 million were up 1% on a sequential basis.
As we've discussed in previous quarters we are investing significantly in this market to enhance our product portfolio and rebuild our distribution channels.
The decline year-on-year primarily reflects the loss of business in the Middle East and product certification challenges in our U.K.
market again a market where we continue to make real progress.
Positive highlights included Russia where sales remained strong benefiting from a large win in the second quarter with one of Russia's largest banks.
In our European payment-as-a-service business sales also increased sequentially as we continue to drive additional customers to our value-added solution.
And finally turning to Asia Q4 revenues of $57 million were up 8% on a sequential basis and included increased sales in New Zealand related to a recent acquisition in May and increased sales in India.
Our reduction in sales from a year ago reflects some competitive pressures in Indonesia.
Additional information on organic and constant currency growth is also included in today's press release.
Now I will discuss results by line of business.
Our systems solutions revenue was $259 million in Q4 down 23% from the prior year.
This is not acceptable and we are addressing these declines with the additional investment in next-generation products and improvements in our product certification processes.
To this end we have made progress on a sequential basis with revenues up 3% mainly reflecting increased sales in North America.
Services revenues were a record $173 million in Q4 an increase of 13% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Service revenues represented 40% of our total revenues in Q4 consistent with the prior quarter.
Primary drivers of the revenue growth are the continued uptake for our value-added offerings in our payment-as-a-service business growth in the U.S.
taxi business for transactions and advertising and our recent acquisition in New Zealand and in France.
Moving now to gross margin performance.
Our consolidated gross margin was 41.2% an increase of 40 basis points from our third quarter.
The sequential improvement in our system solutions gross margin as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects customer and geographic mix.
Our services business gross margin decreased slightly from the third quarter of 2013 to 45.5% in the fourth quarter and also reflected changes in customer and geographic mix.
Let me briefly discuss operating expenses.
During the quarter our operating expenses were $131 million an increase of $4 million over the prior quarter as we increased our investment in product development sales and marketing.
Now let's discuss the balance sheet.
We are pleased with our progress this quarter on improving the balance sheet and our increased focus on cash management.
Cash management is among the top priorities for the VeriFone team.
We ended fiscal year '13 with a cash balance of $268 million and net debt of $768 million.
Since the beginning of fiscal year 2013 our gross debt has been reduced by $272 million and our net debt is down $86 million.
Please see our detailed credit agreement financial covenant calculations posted on our website.
Continuing with the good progress on our balance sheet our inventory decreased by $33 million to $139 million and inventory measured as days of supply decreased favorably by 9 days to 55 days.
We are focused on making continuous process improvements around our demand planning activities product and platform optimization and centralization of procurement activities to optimize inventory levels and improve our overall product costs.
We also transferred $14 million of inventory procured in prior quarters to fixed assets in Q4 to further support our service business opportunities.
Our accounts receivable DSO increased slightly by 1 day to 59 days and our accounts receivable balance increased to $284 million as a result of higher sequential sales.
We continue to focus on improving collections in every region through process improvements including a focus on improving monthly linearity.
Accounts payable ended the quarter at $117 million an increase of $5 million quarter-over-quarter; and our days payable remained constant at 41 days.
Turning now to cash flow.
In the fourth quarter of 2013 operating cash flow was $55 million and our free cash flow was $38 million for the quarter.
This was meaningfully higher than our non-GAAP net income as a result of working capital improvement offset partially by one-time charges for integration of our recent acquisitions and employment-related matters.
During this period we tightly controlled capital spending and invested $17 million in CapEx including $7 million on revenue-generating assets mainly systems for our payment-as-a-service model and our taxi business.
And finally let me provide more detail on our guidance.
Consistent with our comments last quarter we continue to expect revenue and EPS to be up sequentially from our Q4 guidance of $418 million to $422 million in revenue and the non-GAAP earnings of $0.25 per share.
As such for Q1 we are guiding non-GAAP revenue in the range of $425 million to $430 million and non-GAAP earnings at $0.26 per share.
In addition we are reinstating full year guidance and expect revenues in the range of $1.77 billion to $1.8 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.35 to $1.40.
Our guidance includes investments to support our 2014 growth expectations.
And in connection with our 3 initiatives outlined by Paul we expect to see benefits to our cost structure beginning in the latter part of the year and expect more significant benefits beginning in 2015.
We will provide more information on future calls as we progress with these initiatives.
Additionally we expect free cash flow for the full year to be approximately 85% of our non-GAAP net income excluding large one-time cash items such as the Q1 legal settlement we previously discussed.
Please refer to Slide 16 of our earnings presentation for a more comprehensive view of our content on our guidance as well as additional forward-looking financial information.
Thank you very much.
And let me now turn the call back over to Paul for closing remarks and then we will take your questions.
Okay.
Thank you Marc.
As I stated earlier we have significant market-leading strengths to build on and we have a tremendous platform.
We also have a lot of work ahead of us to enable VeriFone to live up to its potential.
Our deep client relationships position us well to further lead the evolution that's already underway in payments and commerce.
We're excited about the opportunities ahead.
We expect to make significant progress throughout 2014 on the initiatives that I've outlined for you today.
We will provide you with periodic updates on our progress and you should expect to see improvements from VeriFone in the following areas: Number one further development of a current and globally-relevant product portfolio delivered on time every time with consistency and quality; number two accelerated rollout of our global payment-as-a-service offering; number three a steady stream of innovation driving commerce enablement; number four improvement in our operating stability and financial discipline; and five continued evidence that our clients view us as their trusted partner.
We believe the initiatives we are currently undertaking will provide VeriFone with sustainable long-term solutions to help our company and position us for further growth and success.
We're confident that we're making the right investments and executing the right strategy to position VeriFone as the go-to partner for our clients and to create sustainable shareholder value for you.
With that I would like the operator to please open the line for questions.
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> Maybe I'll just ask a big picture question to start off.
Just I'm curious we get a lot of questions about earnings power of the company.
I'm curious if you can just at a high level sort of comment on where you see the greatest potential forward to unlock some earnings for the business.
And also on the same -- along the same lines where is the -- where do you see the biggest earnings risk in putting this strategy together and fixing the basics as you laid out? I appreciate the question Tien-tsin and it's nice to meet you on the phone.
I think the first part of the question the earnings power of the company I view VeriFone as having a wonderful advantage in having these hardware devices in 20 million locations and unlocking the power of earnings means to make sure that these devices are the go-to devices for merchants going forward in increasing size.
And then obviously the really exciting part is being able to network these devices -- or give clients the opportunity to network these devices and be able to provide additional services beyond accepting a card swipe or a tap or a pin pad entry.
I think that these devices are just a fascinating item in that it's really where the physical world meets the digital world every single day.
And I think that given all the advances in technology that we're seeing and all the advances in business models that point of interaction becomes extremely valuable.
In terms of the risks to earnings I would say that the greatest risk today is time.
How much time we will need to complete the work I think is so important for us to do in strengthening the foundation.
To be a really powerful innovator and a great advocate and partner for our clients means that we need to be the most reliable and the most efficient technology company out there and we've got a little work to do to get there.
And so I think it's time.
Research Division</strong> Got it got it.
If I may just a follow-up there.
I guess you've obviously given us the Q1 guidance.
I understand that.
But it does imply a step-up in earnings from say whatever [ph] 26 to something in the high-30s as we step into 2Q through 4Q.
Can we assume that gross margins will be pretty consistent there and most of that will come through OpEx to get there? And I know you're going to give us an update later on timing and you just said timing is tough.
But I mean should we assume it's going to be more back-end weighted? Just trying to sketch the model out a little bit better here.
Tien-tsin.
This is Marc and thank you as well for the question.
With respect to the guidance we did give a Q1 guidance of $425 million to $430 million and we reinstated the full year guidance of $1.77 billion to $1.8 billion.
Our expectations would be that the second half results are more reflective of a refreshed portfolio.
And therefore we expect our gross margins to be modestly higher in Q3 and Q4.
So we'll be a step -- there will be a step function in the second half of this year.
Having said that we would expect some sequential progress in Q2 as well.
Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Paul I just want to start off.
As the new CEO can you just talk a bit more about your strategy and view of VeriFone's role in the market? And I guess in particular do you view VeriFone as eventually being primarily a services company or a hardware player? And then just to touch on that can you comment a bit on how much VeriFone should be in services versus solutions especially given you had about 40% of your quarter coming from services revenue now? Just a quick follow-up that I'm going to have on the overall growth rate.
Sure Darrin.
It's again good to meet you on the phone.
Darrin look I reserve the right to become a lot smarter and better able to articulate the next chapter strategy for VeriFone after having a couple of quarters under my belt.
Having said that my experience and instincts have really helped me develop some early hunches.
I think the strategy for VeriFone must really address the reality that as of today we are likely generating 60% of our revenues by selling purpose-built hardware devices.
I love the hardware business.
I have no -- absolutely no desire to shy away from it.
I think it gives us an amazing advantage in a time when payments and commerce are converging and there's so much creative time and energy going into this space.
I think VeriFone must excel at the hardware business while starting to better leverage our devices to provide true commerce and payment services.
And we do that by enabling secure but open platforms for our clients.
I'm a big believer that simplicity is the new quality and VeriFone must really simplify our operating model to enable us to be more nimble and more focused on our strengths.
And really the key is to strategically position our business to benefit from these macro forces trends in mobile and local commerce and that's where really we're putting most of our focus and energy into.
That's where I think will make the greatest headway.
Research Division</strong> All right.
That's helpful.
Just a quick follow-up.
Your -- when you joined the company you looked at it it is obvious growth rate is going through transition.
But you're clearly now at least in this quarter in particular you're seeing traction on regaining back some of your market share with Latin America being pretty stable.
Obviously Canada looks like it's on the right track as well.
That said I mean your growth rate for '14 guidance obviously implies a mid-single digit growth rate.
Do you think that once you get back to a base where your revenue is now at sort of a similar mix to what you thought it would be versus vis-à-vis the market share you should be growing at a different rate? What kind of growth profile does VeriFone should have longer term -- over many years to come? Well I think that's a really good question Darrin.
Let me be clear.
I don't think we are operating at the level that we're all necessarily proud of at the moment.
So the 5% growth year-over-year is a realistic view of what is likely to happen but that is not an aspirational view.
That is not something that we are excited by.
We need to fix the basics of the company.
The 3 initiatives that I discussed in my remarks will go a long way to doing that.
It will also allow us to position the company to innovate seamlessly with our clients and hand in hand with some of the most innovative companies out there.
I'm a big believer in JVs and partnerships.
And so I want to be able to do that.
I think if we're successful and I have every intention of making sure we are we should start to see growth rates not in the single digits but in my view in the double digits.
That's where we want to be and that's where we're working hard to get to.
Research Division</strong> All right.
That's great.
Just one last -- if I could squeeze one last one and then I'll turn it over for Marc.
The guidance that's given on EPS obviously calls for a lot of the step-up in expense.
I think we were calculating somewhere around a 12.5% operating -- adjusted operating margin maybe 13% to get to your numbers.
It's obviously an improvement but not a size we had thought previously.
So with that said I mean is this mostly on R&amp;D because I know you talked a lot about that? Where should we see that pickup in expense? Correct.
I would profile it and I would allocate it mostly to R&amp;D for your models.
We gave -- I'd really like to refer to -- you to that Slide 16 in the deck.
We put a lot of financial information out there to assist in modeling.
I expected $133 million of operating expenses in the quarter.
All of that step-up from Q4 is R&amp;D -- or a substantial portion of that is R&amp;D and that's where we're going to be putting our money.
Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> I guess one for each of you.
Paul you mentioned some fairly significant mobile wins in the U.S.
at least high-profile customers.
Can you talk a little bit about how you view VeriFone's win rate in mobile versus a myriad other competitors as well as how that's trended? And just generally are you leading with the GlobalBay solution at Tier 1 retailers or is it really more of a follow-on sale if you will? I would just love a little insight strategically on how you're going to market with mobile and how you feel like the early success has been on your 78 days at VeriFone.
I appreciate that Andrew.
Thanks for pointing out that I'm a newbie.
I think that -- well let's start with the fact that when you have a product company that already has 20-plus-million devices in the market that our focus is to make sure that our existing clients are happy with our products and services and that we provide to them whatever it is that they feel they need in order to compete in the market.
And we are hearing from clients across the globe both in developed and developing markets the importance of mobility the importance of being able to provide a different kind of sales environment for consumers that are walking into their stores.
So mobile is hot.
Mobile is absolutely critical.
And we are continuing of course to invest in it and to build out our capabilities.
I really do believe Andrew that today most of our sales processes are add-on sales as opposed to de novo.
We don't know the client.
They don't know us and they come to us for mobile.
I think to get to that level where we need to do is not only be known as the most secure and the most industrial-strength payments provider but we also need to be the most innovative.
And I think we have a little bit of work to do there.
There are a lot of great technology companies that are focused on mobility.
They have terrific software.
What they I think in many instances lack are things beyond just the communication layer.
That's where a true payments enabler true industrial-strength secure payments company can come into focus.
And that's where I see VeriFone playing strongly.
I think the other very important issue is convergence right? In order for us to maximize the earnings potential of this company we're going to have to take those terminals.
We're going to have to take the terminals and the software that we have.
We're going to have to build services around them even more profound services than we have today.
And we have to make sure that we can untether these devices and make them part of the selling experience.
And I think that's absolutely critical for us.
You'll see us focused on that.
You'll see us investing in it.
I'm a big believer in it.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
That's helpful.
And then Marc just trying to drill down a little bit on gross margin.
I mean you have given us a number of piece parts but I'm just trying to get my arms around a little more because I think it is such an important measure of the health of your business.
You saw 40 basis point uptick in the non-GAAP gross margin this quarter.
Is -- the implication is you can do a little bit better next year.
Can you just talk about -- are we kind of troughing out here? Should gross margin head higher? How much is -- it looks like the services mix should continue to improve.
Just any more granularity you can give us on gross margin I think would be helpful.
Great.
Thanks -- thank you Andrew.
So it was a slight uptick this quarter from Q3.
However we still had significant charges from a supply chain perspective on inventory write-downs similar to what we had in the third quarter.
But nonetheless we had a 40 basis point improvement an improvement on the systems business.
Our expectation going into 2014 and what we've planned is that we're significantly out of the inventory write-down business.
I think we've gotten a lot of that behind us hopefully all of it.
And we start to refresh our product portfolio going into second quarter and into the second half of the year and that should be additive to gross margin profile.
So as I said before I expect -- I would expect modest improvement in Q1 and I would expect more significant improvement in the second half of the year.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So to say it was similar -- the write-downs were similar to the third quarter somewhere in the order of 200 basis point headwind in gross margin in the fourth quarter? Approximately.
Your next question comes from the line of Meghna Ladha with Susquehanna.
LLLP Research Division</strong> The GlobalBay Merchant suite which was recently launched with the Tier 3 and Tier 4 merchants what's your strategy or -- and what has the initial feedback been like from these customers? Well Meghna it was very nice to meet you on the phone.
The GlobalBay Merchant program is as you know relatively new.
And we're focused on being quite rapid in how we're building that platform how we're innovating that software.
I really like the team that's focused on it.
They're employing an agile methodology for building their software.
I've got a first glimpse of it a couple of weeks ago.
It was quite impressive what they had put together.
I think that there are client segments that VeriFone serves to-date that will have a lot of interest in this product.
It's not one that may work well for Tier 1 and Tier 2 but I think it has a lot of applicability in Tier 3 and 4.
I think it's got a lot of applicability not just in the U.S.
but over time across the globe.
And so I'm actually quite impressed with both the product and the team and I think that they've got a very interesting roadmap ahead.
The question is how is it going to be differentiated from the many other people that are working in the mobile point-of-sale space and that are creating their own versions of it? I mean you see it with things like Clover and you see it with things across the board.
Good products well put together.
They serve a specific function and they serve a specific client base.
What I'm excited about is again using that distribution channel that we have using the fact that we're in 150 countries using the fact that we are not just a software company that can create great user interfaces and have a lot of functionality but we are an industrial scale payments provider.
We are a secure strong environment for payments.
And I think that over time that caliber of security is really an important differentiator right? I mean your software can improve.
You could make more bells and whistles on it.
You could have more functionality.
But at the end of the day you're dealing with payments and payments are really important.
LLLP Research Division</strong> Got it.
And the next question was on EMV.
So if that's a big catalyst for this industry.
I just wanted to get your view on this topic.
And what's the potential opportunity for VeriFone? Well I think EMV is clearly something that is in my view coming to the U.S.
I think people have put dates on.
Whether those dates slipped a bit or not I think is less critical than the fact that people want greater security on card payments and I think financial networks have made it very clear that between the liability shift and the timing of it these things are going to happen.
I think for VeriFone it's obviously a positive.
It drives the re-terminalization.
I'm happy to report that we today ship out EMV terminals across the globe and certainly have been for the United States and we are more than prepared and ready to do that.
I also would like to make sure that our terminals have more capacity beyond just EMV that they are able to deal with what I think is coming down the road on more proximity more QR more capability from that device that you're dealing with today.
Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria with Wedbush Securities.
Research Division</strong> You gave us a good update about the progress in Canada which was one of the countries you need to make progress.
In U.K.
I believe you are already making progress.
Can you give us the timeline for when you're going to have the refreshed products in Brazil and in France? Do you still think you'll have the products that your 2 big customers in Brazil want by the middle of your fiscal year? Have you made the progress in France that you'd like that you'd get products out gradually through the year? Where do we stand on that? Gil This is Marc.
Good evening.
On Brazil we're making progress still even with the legacy products.
We're winning deals on portables and we do have new certifications as well.
The issue with Brazil for us in the quarter and really in the first half is that it comes out of pricing challenge.
So that's factored into the guidance that we've provided.
Having said that when we get later into 2014 we expect really Q4 to have additional product for the Brazilian market; on the portable side specifically new form factors as well as new features and functionalities.
So we're making good progress actually with our existing product albeit more price sensitive and looking forward to deploying refreshed products towards the later part of 2014.
With France in particular as you know what we -- I think we've said previously we don't have a lot of product offerings in our French marketplace.
We've certainly been investing in that area.
I would expect more towards the latter half of Q2.
Early in the second half we'll be starting to roll out products in that marketplace.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
And then on the other side in terms of the timeline you provided there a very comprehensive vision of the kind of restructuring you need to do.
And in fact you expect some benefits in 2014.
Does that mean that you expect the heavy lifting the 80 in the 80/20 to be done by the end of fiscal '14 in terms of restructuring the organization research and development streamlining the products making it more centralized as opposed to decentralized? I'd expect on the initiatives that Paul laid out that we're going to make significant process -- progress over the coming 3.5 quarters.
But you know how things work in back-office.
Consolidating systems and legal entities and whatnot do take some time.
But as we've said expect some benefit towards the end of this year and more significant benefit going into 2015.
If I can just add Gil and -- as I have spent time looking at the various organizations within VeriFone I've traveled quite a bit and met people in the offices where they do their work.
I've looked at the number of systems that are being used that effectively are doing the same thing.
But boy these systems don't look at all alike.
Talk about the number of legal entities we have talk about the number of physical locations that we have.
These are all things that really indicate that we're not incredibly well designed at the moment.
And so the first part is you get the architecture right.
I feel like we're getting there.
I feel like we're getting a real handle on what this thing should look like.
The second part is executing it.
And I think the scorecards in this management team is 100% aligned on the need and the desire.
And by the way our employees are cheering this along because they want it fixed.
And so we're going to do that work.
We're going to come in every morning and have our to-do list and we're just going to chop through this.
And then at the end of it I think we're going to have a more nimble more capable company with which to serve our clients.
That's the goal.
If it takes us 2014 so be it.
If it takes us 2014 and a quarter that's fine too.
What I don't want to do is cut corners.
I want to do this right.
This is something that should have been done some time back and we recognize that.
And so now we're going to do it right.
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.
Research Division</strong> I just wanted to start with a free cash flow question.
I guess for Marc obviously it's exceeded non-GAAP net income I think for 3 straight quarters now.
Obviously good to see.
Now for fiscal '14 you're expecting it to be about 85% of the non-GAAP net income.
So is that just reflective of a catch-up in CapEx that you're expecting or some conservatism or other factors we should be thinking about? Jason thank you for the question.
A couple of things on the 85% rule here.
One is the business has plan to grow at the mid-point at 4.5% 5% at the high end and that's going to take some working capital of course.
Of course we're going to continue to drive the optimization that we've been driving on working capital management and I think there's opportunity in inventory and payables still to do that.
But it's a function of growth to support the business.
In addition there's some work we'll need to do relative to integrating the acquisitions that we made.
Your point is correct as well.
The capital expenditures I framed it at $90 million to $100 million for the year.
It's still outpacing the depreciation expense.
So therefore it's a slight drag in terms of operating cash flow.
I think the 85% is a good number to use for modeling purposes.
Research Division</strong> Okay okay.
That's helpful.
And then can you just give us the sense by geography how much of your market share loss is likely to be temporary versus being semipermanent when all is said and done? How much market share can you reasonably expect to recover within the first 6 to 12 months let's say of getting your product certifications completed in the various countries that you're especially focused on right now? I believe we're going to make progress in all the geographies in 2014.
That's our plan.
We've -- in some markets we had a good quarter good results in Q4.
I commented before in terms of our ability to maintain very good client relationships with our major acquirers in Brazil and that trend is going to continue through the first half.
So we're making progress on recapturing some market share.
Clearly it's dependent upon us and our ability to execute on the products and services that our clients need in the marketplace.
The plan that I presented to you today -- that we presented assumes that we're going to have growth in all the regions that we operate in.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just a quick housekeeping item.
I think you mentioned some integration charges in Q4.
Can you size those for us? The integration charges in Q4 were approximately 3.5 -- just let's use $4 million for integration during the fourth quarter and the other charge is related to employee-related matters.
Gentlemen we have time for one more question and it comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Two questions.
First one is on the rate and pace of certification approval around the globe.
You guys gave some commentary about Canada.
Congratulations.
Some on Brazil it sounds like there's more to come there.
But can you kind of give us a sense -- and part of this relates to the prior conference call where I think there was 25 open certification applications.
Kind of where do we stand in that pipeline and how should we think about the completion of that pipeline in fiscal '14? Wayne I appreciate the question.
It's Paul and good to meet you on the phone.
Best that I could tell having gone through this in the last 78 days the way in which we certify our product the way in which we go through the entire requirements gathering and then moving into the production certification and final rollout of products seems to me to be less than ideal right? I see a lot of opportunity to improve I think as does the team.
Part of that is that we seem to do it in different ways depending on where we are in the world.
We seem to have in some instances heavy influence of the folks on the ground in the country that is requesting a particular product or service.
Their involvement in the certification process versus in other places where they're leaning much more on the central organization.
So it's hard for me to say at this stage what kind of pace and rate we could project.
What the differences are.
I need to spend more time on it.
The team needs to do more work on it.
It is absolutely top of mind right.
It's absolutely top of mind.
I would say that having a way to manage the portfolio and decide what products and what services to build first we've got a plan to do that quite differently from the way its being done today.
Once we know what it is that we want to build and have a good business model and rationale as to why the way in which we produce certify and deliver including quality assurance really needs to change in my opinion.
I think that there's more opportunity to do certain elements of the certification in a parallel way as opposed to a serial way.
All of these things if proven correct I think are going to speed up our ability to get certified product.
And it could also be in some instances that decisions were made way back when that folks said "Gee I know it's going to take time and money but we don't want to spend the money.
And so we'll have to deal with the consequences of not having product in market." Right.
So there is -- it's hard for me to say that there's any one definitive thing that we need to change.
I just feel like we need to clean up the process significantly.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Terrific.
I appreciate that answer and we look forward to future updates on those issues and opportunities.
The second question I have is more macro -- more related to the U.S.
Are there any trends that you can call out in the U.S.
that you feel are particularly helpful to the position of VeriFone whether it's the MX 900 at the high end? And then can you balance that with what trends are taking place where you don't think you are as well positioned as you'd like to be and corrective action needs to be implemented? Sure Wayne.
Well I mean certainly in the United States we are extraordinarily well positioned to deliver for the EMV imperative that I think you're going to see across certainly most merchants that we do business with.
So I think we're extraordinarily well positioned for that.
I think we are probably less well positioned -- or certainly less positioned than I'd like for us to be in the space of -- and you had mentioned the GlobalBay Merchant solution.
I think we need to do more work there.
I think we need to position ourselves better to prove to folks that "You know what.
They've got a lot of choices.
But this choice of working with VeriFone not only gives me the best solution but gives it to me in a way where services and quality and security are really top-notch." That's an area that I think we can do certainly a little bit more work on.
And then finally in this whole convergence area I think we're extraordinarily well positioned.
If payments and commerce goes the way I think it will which is that the act of the payment is just a piece of an end-to-end process between merchants and consumers and there's a lot more intelligence in it there's a lot more ability to stack rank and identify benefits.
I think there we're extraordinarily well positioned.
I think we have the terminals in place.
I think our software can enable us to do things like we're doing with the taxi and being able to burn reward points.
I think there -- it's really quite an exciting future for us.
Well hey I'd like to thank everybody.
I appreciate you all being here on our first -- or at least my first earnings call.
I'm really looking forward to getting to know each of you and having conversations on future calls.
So I want to thank you for your participation and happy holidays.
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference.
Thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a great day.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 VeriFone Systems Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Paul Galant CEO of VeriFone.
Thank you Doug and good afternoon to everyone and thanks for joining us today.
Last quarter I outlined the case for why VeriFone really matters in payments and we will thrive during this coming decade in the payments industry as electronic payments converge with digital commerce predictive analytics and mobility.
I talked about our people our global footprint and our market leading installed base of 20 plus million terminals found in over 150 countries.
And I laid out our vision and strategy that we believe will enable VeriFone to capitalize on opportunities to achieve sustainable growth.
Our vision for VeriFone is to become our clients’ most trusted most secure and innovative partner by delivering terminals payment as a service and commerce enablement solutions.
And our strategy for achieving this vision is to connector our terminals and solutions into our industrial-strength secure payment as a service platform capable of hosting VeriFone and third-party developed commerce enablement applications.
The VeriFone payment as a service platform encrypts and secures consumer information delivers merchant analytics and enables the full value chain of commerce enablement without compromising security.
With this as our goal I am pleased to report that the VeriFone team has made meaningful progress since our last call and that we’ve again exceeded our financial guidance for revenue and earnings per share as well as free cash flow.
We've also been working hard to transform VeriFone into the company that we all wanted to be – a VeriFone that is client first operationally excellent strategically focused and properly organized with a single distinct culture.
Once accomplished we’re confident that we can create a competitive advantage and deliver a long-term sustainable value.
I want to update you on how we’re executing against these three top VeriFone initiatives that we outlined last quarter and that would allow us to fix our foundation and change how the company is managed.
I will also articulate the progress we've made in areas we believe will allow VeriFone to flourish in the dynamic and growing market and consumer initiated commerce globally.
Since we spoke last quarter we've moved aggressively to fix how VeriFone is managed by executing our three top VeriFone initiative.
First redefining our global product management processes and portfolio.
Second reengineering our R&amp;D function and third improving our cost structure.
Let’s start with our product management initiative which is designed to significantly simplify and streamline our global product portfolio mix.
The people at VeriFone know that we have too many product SKUs and it's really as a result of numerous acquisitions which result in overlapping solutions and a fragmented development environment.
We have aggressively redefined VeriFone's processes for evaluating new and existing products to ensure they fit with our strategy and meet our clients’ ongoing needs.
As of today each of our more than 1000 SKUs have been initially vetted and evaluated using a consistent global model and process and we have already identified at least 25% of these SKUs for rationalization and replacement.
This ongoing process will reduce complexity across our company from development to procurement to sales and marketing and to customer support.
Replacing SKUs will also have a significant impact on our R&amp;D reengineering initiative.
Today VeriFone's global R&amp;D footprint includes more than 1800 employees across 75 sites who in our view are spending too much time and resources maintaining legacy products and supporting 13 different operating platforms.
We know that in order to reduce complexity eliminate overlapping platforms and improve cycle times this must and will change.
During the quarter we evaluated our R&amp;D sites and are now finalizing our plan to establish centers of excellence to better leverage our global footprint and achieve the collaborative benefit of having engineers in the same room.
I will update you on our execution progress around this specific work stream during next quarter's call.
As we streamline our R&amp;D organization we will free up resources and begin directing approximately 10% of our R&amp;D budget to focus on new commercial innovation.
To this end we are today assembling a team of VeriFone's best and brightest leaders who will advocate for our clients and drive innovation to benefit their respective businesses.
Finally we continue to address the overlap in our operating model through our third initiative: cost optimization.
Our global team has identified more than 50 cost savings projects.
These projects address everything from the prices we pay to procure goods and services to improvements we can make in our internal processes that will contribute to efficiency and to our bottom line.
Each project has an owner accountable for executing and delivering the expected benefits.
Simplicity is the new quality and on every level we are actively working to simplify the VeriFone organization.
We've begun the process of streamlining our existing 132 legal entities to 70.
We’re also working to significantly consolidate our more than 40 data centers and we're finalizing plans to begin the consolidation of some of our 129 facilities.
Again I will provide more detail on the execution of these projects during next quarter's call.
These top three VeriFone initiatives are being managed globally by our newly established transformation office.
The transformation office includes our global team of business leaders and employees working to gather and analyze data who make recommendations and drive in market execution with our clients.
To lead this team Ed Wiggers has joined VeriFone as head of Global Transformations.
Ed has a proven track record driving transformation in major growth initiatives at global and entrepreneurial firms including incidentally Citi where he and I worked closely together.
As we ramp up the operation of the transformation office we recognize more and more based on the results that our decentralized operating structure is really at the root cause of many of our foundational challenges.
We're driving a new model for both decision-making and accountability to turn our vast global footprint and client franchise into our sustainable competitive advantage.
As several VeriFone employees commented to me recently during my site visit to Asia and I quote “Hey VeriFone has all the complexity of a global franchise but does not take full advantage of the benefits”.
I think that's true.
To fix this we are rapidly evolving VeriFone's organizational structure.
We're transforming VeriFone from a confederation of independent country businesses into a nimble consolidated global organization with country authority at the last mile to meet local regulations and serve the individual needs of our clients.
This change enables us to leverage our experiences across the globe and engineer the best possible solutions for our clients borrowing from all the experiences that we get serving clients in market.
And it assures that we operate with a disciplined focus on global product and P&amp;L management that has been lacking at VeriFone.
To make this transformation happen we're reorganizing and we’ll be appointing three new global product P&amp;L heads.
Bill Nelson will be our head of Terminal Solutions.
I introduced Bill Nelson to you at our last earnings call and we’re confident that his experience leading business functions at global technology firms such as EMC AT&amp;T and Nuance gets him the credibility and know-how to overhaul our core terminal solutions business.
Mike Rahm will lead payment as a service.
Mike was our senior most executive at Point when we asked him to serve as interim head of Europe.
While the search for a permanent head of Europe is well underway I’ve asked Mike to wear two-hats for a period of time and lead the effort to turn payment as a service into a global best-in-class business for VeriFone.
Vin D'Agostino will run commerce enablement.
Vin’s experience as head of Payment Strategy for JP Morgan Chase running large global teams gives us the confidence that he will execute our strategic push into commerce enablement to help our clients grow sales with value-added services that go beyond payments.
This quarter I also worked with each member of my management committee to develop individualized performance scorecards that focus their execution and hold them fully accountable for their role in driving continued business performance supporting our vision and strategy.
I mentioned this to you during our last earnings call and I'm happy to report that these scorecards are not only developed but they are also now distributed to each member of the management committee.
Moving forward I expect that everyone at VeriFone will be measured and accountable in a way that aligns with the strategy that we've updated you on today.
As I hope you can tell we're making important progress executing against our top three VeriFone initiatives and I'm confident that these will allow us to permanently fix our foundation and change how VeriFone is managed.
With our core foundation improving and our organizational structure aligning to where our clients most need VeriFone we're now in a position to go to market and capture incremental share.
To succeed we will number one improve the way we run our terminal solutions business globalize our payment as a service offering and lastly significantly innovate in the area of commerce enablement.
These all start with intense engagement with our clients.
Let me begin with terminal solutions.
You know as table-stakes our clients have told us time and time again that they need VeriFone to provide leading-edge certified terminal solutions in their key markets.
To this end we've listened and made major progress.
Examples include in Western Europe we’d gained the MasterCard contactless approval that are important in that region especially in the UK.
In France during the quarter we introduced our latest generation of countertop devices to market the first of a series of products that we will bring to market there throughout fiscal year 2014.
And in Brazil we earned substantial competitive wins with our portable terminals with the country’s two largest acquirers and we remain on track to introduce a new portable product in Brazil by late fiscal year 2014.
As we improve our existing terminal solutions business it is clear that there is significant opportunity to grow our business in emerging geographies such as China India Turkey and Latin America.
For example my recent trip to Asia highlighted the opportunity and need for VeriFone to provide a lower-cost EMV payment solution in China.
As a result we have mobilized our global product and engineering teams on the ground there to develop a strategy and roadmap to provide this market with a lighter solution that leads with uncompromised security.
During the quarter we also successfully launched a new portable terminal in Turkey to meet the government's mandate that all payment devices offer integrated cash register functionality.
This secure high-quality solution was delivered on time and we're capturing new opportunities not only from VeriFone existing clients in the market and also from new clients such as restaurants hotels and supermarkets that are selecting streamlined VeriFone solutions.
Now before we move on to payment as a service and commerce enablement I’d like to discuss a very important and current topic certainly one that I know is on everyone's mind.
The recent consumer data breaches in the U.S.
have created an even greater sense of urgency from clients to deploy EMV point-to-point encryption and tokenization in order to better protect against these serious ongoing threats.
This is VeriFone's top client value proposition and it is very much the hallmark of our brand.
And at this time of major concern it is where we shine against our traditional competitors and truly distinguish ourselves versus recent entrants into the payments business.
We are increasingly engaging our clients at the whiteboard to help them to reduce their growing exposure to data breaches and cyber criminals and more aggressively helping them to protect their consumer data.
Let me now share a few comments on EMV.
VeriFone has been instrumental in the global rollout of EMV solutions.
Today we provide more than 50% of the world’s EMV capable terminals.
We are shipping EMV capable solutions to merchants throughout the U.S.
including of course the tier one retail segment where we are the far and away market leader.
In Q1 70% of terminals shipped by VeriFone in the U.S.
were EMV capable and we expect this to trend higher.
Going forward we expect our biggest opportunity in EMV to come not only from top retailers but more so from restaurants shops hotels and government offices that will need consumer facing EMV capable systems for the first time.
To put a number on it we estimate over the next several years approximately 3 million additional EMV terminals will be added to the U.S.
market on top of the current installed base.
Of course chip cards and EMV readers alone are not enough to immediately and fully protect consumer payment data.
Rather achieving this requires a comprehensive approach that includes point-to-point encryption of consumer payment credentials beginning at the terminal and remaining fully encrypted until it’s unlocked behind firewalls of the retailers’ payment processors.
Encryption combined with EMV and tokenization will dramatically improve the safety and soundness of the U.S.
and global consumer payment system.
We believe that VeriFone is equipped than anyone else to provide the solutions in scale needed to achieve this.
VeriFone’s encryption solution VeriShield Protect is the de facto standard for eight of the top 11 U.S.
acquirers.
170 national U.S.
merchants have engaged us to encrypt data at the point of swipe with VeriFone solutions.
In addition we continue to gain major momentum with our encryption solutions as clients demand more of this in Asia EMEA and Latin America.
While we still have much work to do on our terminal business I hope you can see we’re getting our arms around our challenges and making progress in several key areas.
And we believe we’re well-positioned to capture growth opportunities.
Now I would like to talk about globalizing our payment as a service business.
Payment as a service enables VeriFone to better serve our clients by delivering all of the necessary hardware software and field services they require to securely accept payments across multi-channels in a consolidated and integrated package delivered through a secure single server platform.
This includes terminals it includes installation maintenance helpdesk services like foreign-exchange mobility e-commerce and more.
We continue to expand on our point acquisition and leverage our substantial payment as a service experience [indiscernible] to accelerate rollout of new solutions in new markets.
For example in Australia we’re making significant investment and executing progress with the top banks in that country.
In New Zealand EFTPOS our payment as a service business continues to achieve solid results with 6% growth over last quarter.
In the U.S.
we've already connected more than 4000 devices into a secure service offering back to VeriFone with our payment as a service solution.
In Q1 alone we signed an agreement with the Body Shop for its 250 retail stores.
This retailer will roll out VeriFone’s EMV and NFC capable terminals VeriShield Protect point-to-point encryption estate management software and online gateway services to enable secure mobile and loyalty solutions.
And in Sweden we've partnered with Handelsbanken one of Sweden's largest banks to roll out a new solution that includes our latest secure hardware for accepting chip and PIN payments using VeriFone smart devices.
Lastly I'll update you on the progress regarding commerce enablement and it’s a topic that we introduced during our last earnings call.
Commerce enablement refers to VeriFone's role in enabling activities well beyond payment to create more valuable experiences for and more rich interactions between consumers and merchants.
Commerce enablement enhances payments with presale and post-sale capabilities such as targeted offers loyalty couponing real-time reward redemptions real-time foreign-exchange transactions receipt management and other popular consumer utilities.
As with globalizing our payment as a service capabilities our ability to innovate and deliver new experiences at the physical mobile and online point of commerce will drive new revenue opportunities for our clients.
And there are a number of great examples of VeriFone enabling commerce for our clients today.
In our U.S.
petrol business Hess will roll out VeriFone’s LiftRetail our interactive marketing solution to increase in-store sales across its 1800 company-owned retail locations.
LiftRetail moves the customer experience beyond accepting payment by also delivering unique offers to consumers based on their purchases and running real-time analytics that furnish suggested selling scripts for store associates to help grow sales.
Also in the U.S.
we recently introduced digital taxi top advertising displays to New York City where we’re now the preferred payment in media provider for more than 11 000 New York City yellow and green borough taxis.
These new digital displays are simply incredible and were introduced during a parade hosted by the NFL at SuperBowl XLVIII and they enabled full-motion video along with geo-targeting to tailor specific messages to specific areas of the city.
Look for these in other VeriFone cities across the globe going forward as well.
And our work with American Express on pay with points at taxis continues to delight American Express delight their cardmembers our fleet owners and their drivers.
This experience is starting to pave the way for expansion of real-time pay with reward points across our broader point-of-sale solutions.
Finally in the UK VeriFone is very proud to partner with Weve a joint venture among the country's three largest mobile network operators EE O2 and Vodafone.
This partnership will enable the rapid rollout of new mobile commerce services including wallet and loyalty programs.
Weve will use VeriFone’s value-added gateway to enable ubiquitous merchant acceptance while eliminating the complexity of development and integration.
So in conclusion some of the world’s best brands are increasingly choosing VeriFone today.
We have listened to our clients as we’ve shaped our vision and our strategy.
We are executing our initiatives and are absolutely meeting the expectations we set for our financial performance.
I am pleased with our progress today.
However I know we must be more disciplined more data-driven and relentlessly focused on in-market execution.
I am confident that VeriFone has the right team the right strategy and the right execution plan in order for us to achieve our goals and create value for all of our stakeholders.
With that I will now turn the call over to my partner Marc Rothman Chief Financial Officer for VeriFone.
Thank you Paul.
As Paul discussed earlier we are pleased with our results and the progress on our key financial metrics which I will walk through in a moment.
First consistent with the company's past practice we will be referring to certain financial statement information on a non-GAAP basis.
For the first fiscal quarter we reported net revenues of $437 million exceeding our guidance of $425 million to $430 million.
Our net revenues were up 2% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially.
Non-GAAP earnings-per-share were $0.31 exceeding our expectations by $0.05 and compared to non-GAAP earnings-per-share last quarter of $0.21 and $0.51 a year ago.
I will discuss our regional results in more detail.
Our North American revenues were $122 million compared to $124 million last quarter.
We expect modest sequential improvement in North America in Q2.
Our Q1 results reflect several factors.
First in our U.S.
multi-lane retail business we continued to see strong demand for our core integrated retail offering the EMV-capable MX 900 series.
Once again we’ve added a number of new customers either as competitive takeaways or by deploying customer facing payment systems for the first time.
Second sequential gains in our multi-lane retail business were offset by decline in our small and medium business unit where our distributors have modestly reduced their inventory levels on hand as they transition from PCI 1.3 to PCI 3.0.
Third our U.S.
petrol business revenues were up slightly from last quarter as many of our retailers are upgrading their sites to our new touchscreen systems and site controllers.
And finally in North America our taxi business grew 2% sequentially as a result of the continued addition of taxis to our network.
Nationwide this network is now almost 31 000 taxis servicing approximately 1 million passengers daily.
Turning to Latin America.
Revenues for the first quarter were $68 million down 3% sequentially.
Brazil was up in Q1 compared to Q4 due to competitive wins with both major acquirers which we expect to benefit revenues in Brazil throughout 2014.
However in Q1 these increases were offset by lower sales in Latin America primarily in Mexico.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues of $186 million were up 3% sequentially.
We continue to invest significantly in this market to enhance our product and service portfolio and continue to see results.
In Turkey for example our new mobile ECR products which Paul just discussed have been fully certified and Q1 sales were up sequentially.
And our European payment as a service business continues to grow on a sequential basis as clients choose our value-added solutions.
And finally turning to Asia.
Q1 revenue of $60 million were up 6% on a sequential basis resulting from increases in both China and greater Asia.
Now let's discuss results by line of business moving from geographies.
Revenue for system solutions were $261 million in Q1 up sequentially.
As we previously discussed we're making additional investment in certifications in next-generation products and enhancing our development processes to improve competitiveness.
Service revenues were a record $176 million in Q1 an increase of 2% sequentially and 19% year-over-year.
Service revenues represented 40% of total revenues in Q1 consistent with the prior quarter.
The primary drivers of the revenue growth continue to be customers moving to our payment as a service business growth in the U.S.
taxi market and prior year acquisitions we made in New Zealand and in France.
Let's now discuss gross margin performance for these lines of business.
Our consolidated gross margin first was 42.4% an increase of 120 basis points from our fourth quarter.
The sequential improvement in our system solutions gross margin from 38.3% to 40.1% of revenue reflects lower inventory reserves as a result of improved management of our supply chain and service gross margin increased slightly to 45.7% in the first quarter.
Consolidated operating expenses during the quarter were $132 million an increase of $1 million over our fourth quarter focused on our investments in product development.
Now let's discuss the continuous improvement of our balance sheet.
At the end of Q1 our cash balance was $249 million and net debt was $752 million.
Of note the Q1 improvement of $16 million in net debt was after the payment of $61 million which resolves our 2008 shareholder litigation as we previously disclosed.
We continue to delever our balance sheet reducing our borrowings to $1 billion.
Included in this reduction we also improved our capital structure by retiring our more expensive term B loan.
We remain compliant with our credit agreement covenants and please refer to our maintenance covenant ratio calculations posted on our investor relations website for more details.
Now let me provide more color on our balance sheet and working capital over the past year.
Our entire VeriFone team has been focused on this and our great results reflect these efforts.
Our accounts receivable balance decreased by $21 million to $263 million from last quarter and our accounts receivable days sales outstanding also decreased sequentially by 5 days to 54 days both as a result of the strong collections and improved sales linearity.
In addition our receivable days are down by 20 days from this time last year.
Moving to inventory.
Our inventory decreased sequentially by $18 million to $221 million and inventory measured as days of inventory improved by 9 days to 46 days.
Our inventory balance is down $68 million on comparable revenues in just 12 months.
Our accounts payable ended the quarter at $110 million a decrease of $7 million quarter over quarter and a reduction in days payable of 2 days.
Now let me highlight progress in a very important working capital metric which we’ve worked very hard to improve.
One year ago working capital as a percentage of revenue was 22.6% of sales.
Today it is 15.7% almost a 700 basis point improvement and our lowest level since 2005.
Again this is a result of the disciplined and combined effort of the entire VeriFone team.
We will continue to focus on improving working capital performance as we grow our revenues.
Let me turn now to cash flow performance.
In the first quarter cash flow from operations was $32 million and our free cash flow was $11 million.
Excluding the $61 million litigation settlement paid in Q1 our free cash flow was $72 million.
We had previously guided to a negative $25 million in free cash flow.
Our first quarter capital expenditures were $21 million including $11 million on revenue generating assets namely equipment for our payment as a service and taxi businesses.
And finally let now discuss our financial guidance.
For Q2 we’re guiding non-GAAP revenues in the range of $440 million to $445 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.30 to $0.32 per share.
For the full fiscal year 2014 we expect revenues in the range of $1.78 billion to $1.81 billion and earnings per share of $1.40.
The new revenue targets are slightly above our previous guidance and our new EPS guidance is at the high-end of our previous range.
Both revenue and EPS reflects our outperformance in Q1.
Also we now expect free cash flow for the full year to improve to approximately 95% of non-GAAP net income excluding large one-time items such as the Q1 legal settlement I just discussed.
Please refer to our Slide 18 of our earnings presentation for more content on our guidance as well as additional forward-looking financial information.
With respect to our top three VeriFone initiatives our related transformation and restructuring we recognize that you will have a number of questions related to the costs our benefits and the associated timing.
We are still in the middle of this process and we will provide you with initial cost and savings information on our next earnings call.
Thank you and with that I will now turn the call back over to Paul.
Okay.
Thank you Marc.
I’d like to close our prepared remarks by simply saying that VeriFone has the right team the right strategy and the right execution plan in place.
We rely on and have listened to our clients as we work to define our future.
We are executing our initiatives and we’re meeting the expectations we set for financial performance.
We’ve made meaningful progress on our initiatives to both fix the foundation and change the way VeriFone does business and also position the company to thrive in the dynamic and growing market and consumer initiated commerce.
We have a lot more work to do but we’re pleased with the results we have communicated to you today.
I look forward to providing you with an update on our Q2 earnings call.
With that we will now answer your questions.
Operator?  (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan.
Wanted to ask I guess just the upside to the revenue guidance in 1Q where did the upside come from specifically and can you comment on how maybe each region came in versus plan? Sure.
Hi Tien-tsin thanks for the question.
So relative to the midpoint was $10 million and the revenue increases were primarily in Europe and Asia.
As I highlighted Turkey delivered good results with the new product offering the ECR devices that we have first into market we’re really pleased with our first to market from a point-of-sale provider perspective and that certainly helped the European results.
And as I mentioned in Asia we saw a little bit of additional opportunity in China and the parts of greater Asia and those both drove the incremental increases to revenue relative to what we had previously estimated and guided to.
And so I know there's a lot of questions out there about emerging markets and it sounds like you picked up some business in Brazil.
But can you just comment on sort of how the -- what's going on on the ground in some of these emerging markets.
Obviously Russia Argentina Brazil are ones that people are watching closely plus given the FX changes that might complicate things can you just give us a general view there and what's in the outlook? I’d say for most of the emerging markets we’re relatively balanced to a little bit more bullish particularly in Brazil with respect to the recent wins that we have with both acquirers and certainly for us the transition of our portfolio towards the end of 2014.
So we're seeing good momentum particularly in Brazil.
If you recall from prior conversations we won significant business with Sberbank in Russia and that we continue to make good progress in that marketplace.
I’d think it was pretty balanced in Q1 relative to Q4.
And in China as Paul called out we certainly think there's more opportunity for us relative to the state of our portfolio we’re basically playing more in the high-end of the portfolio in China.
And we need to invest in the low end portfolio so that’s what the teams on the ground there are working to obviously that takes a bit of time and we believe that China will also provide more opportunity for us in the coming quarters into 2015.
Certainly we’re not immune Tien-tsin to the volatility that we are all seeing in places like the Ukraine and in Russia and so we will absolutely keep a close eye out on the business activity.
But for purposes first quarter those markets delivered for us.
And our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research.
Can you help us understand the encryption market a little bit better? We've heard things in the past about encryption primarily being a U.S.
opportunity.
Then we're hearing more about it becoming an international opportunity.
Can you help us understand -- just kind of understand what the market opportunity is there? And then second is this going to be a driver of your payment-as-a-service model primarily or as a separate product or a little bit of both? Keith thanks for the question.
It’s really important one.
EMV is something that most people talk about immediately after they hear for breach and if we had EMV in place gosh we would be in a better place in the US.
I think that’s actually true.
I think EMV is an important component of fortifying and improving the safety and soundness of the consumer payment system.
It is however not a immediate fix it is not even a complete fix.
You can put in an EMV terminal but along with the EMV terminal you need EMV cards and you need for EMV acceptance to be turned on.
As you know even though we have certainly been working our level best to deploy EMV terminals into the U.S.
most of them are not operating as full EMV terminals accepting chip and PIN cards.
So we have to deal with the here and now and the here and now is any time a card is presented at a terminal whether it’s swipe or an NFC tap or any other kind of engagement the right process in our view is to immediately encrypt that live credential and to keep that live credential encrypted throughout the entire payment process and value chain up until it lines out up behind the firewall of the processor.
And so products like VeriShield Protect which is our solution do exactly that.
And our terminals today are able to actually encrypt that 16 digit live pan at the hardware level as soon as the card is swiped or tapped.
And at that point it is a much much more robust and protected way for merchants to keep their consumer payment information and other information safe.
In terms of whether it's payment as a service I view this as bread-and-butter table stakes for any conversation I have with a merchant today.
If we are providing a terminal either directly to a merchant or through the acquirer or through a distributor I want to make sure that that merchant knows that end to end encryption is available it's relatively easy to enable and it will make an immediate impact to the safety and soundness of their consumer information.
Right they do not have to wait for EMV.
Once EMV comes along that makes it even better because again trying to counterfeit an EMV card is a substantially different substantially harder proposition than trying to counterfeit a magnetic stripe card.
And so these things have to work hand-in-hand.
There is no one solution you need all of these solutions working hand-in-hand.
Hope that helps.
It does.
And is this an opportunity outside the U.S.
as well or is this primarily just a U.S.
opportunity? It's an opportunity everywhere around the globe.
Any time you have payment cards or credentials live payment credentials used best practice the safest and the smartest thing to do is to encrypt it.
And those solutions are as useful in Europe Asia Latin America as they are in the United States.
Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.
Just two quick questions.
First on free cash flow I think you said earlier Marc that if you would normalize free cash it would have been -- I think it was either $61 million or $71 million.
And I'm trying to see how that squares with the 95% of adjusted net income.
I mean wouldn't that imply I guess your run rate implies a number that's well over $200 million.
What you're guiding towards is something probably closer to $140 million.
Is that just conservatism or -- Yes let me clarify a couple of those comments.
So we had $11 million of free cash flow in Q1 and we paid $61 million for the 2008 shareholder litigation.
So with that it would have been $72 million.
And the uptick to 95% we were at 85% – we went to 95% of net income to free cash flow – non-GAAP net income to free cash flow reflects a combination of things principally the difference between the fact that capital expenditures are outpacing depreciation.
I guided to $25 million of CapEx in Q2 and $90 million to $100 million for the full year and depreciation is running roughly $15 million a quarter slightly above that.
What happened in Q1 which certainly we’re delighted about so we spent little time overemphasizing the great performance on working capital so we made sure that step improvements in Q1 related to both inventory and receivables.
And that was very very additive.
Now the guidance for revenue obviously reflects step increases throughout the year.
So there will be some consumption of working capital.
We will be working hard to keep that in balance.
So I think when you model it out and you can work with the IR folks we will have conversations about the numbers here but you will see that it's -- 95% makes pretty good sense from a modeling perspective.
Just one quick follow-up.
It was really addressing the topics on EMV.
Paul thanks for the quick data points on the potential size of the addressable market increase I think you said about 3 million terminals.
If we look at that 3 million increase and we look at it as a percentage of the base I think we've estimated it as around 12 million to 13 million terminals in the U.S.
right now.
What should we expect in terms of what you hope to capture from a market share standpoint of that 3 million and is there anything about the type of terminals that are going out there whether it's in the restaurants or it's obviously in the hotels or others that you might have a better industry vertical expertise on that we could expect to see an outsized market share or similar to your typical market share opportunity for that big increase in the addressable market? Darrin let me see if I take a crack at that.
So look the brand in the United States VeriFone is ubiquitous.
People certainly are comfortable with it.
We are without any question going to be in the hunt on any retailer on any vertical that is moving to EMV.
So the fact that we are in the room the fact that our brand is well-regarded I think gives us an advantage and for that I think we're very grateful and happy.
Moving to solutions beyond the terminals is sort of where my head’s out which is if you’re going to make the change this is really a good time to get at the whiteboard with a person or company you trust and understand how this new digital commerce environment is going to look like over the coming decade.
You know you’re going to put in an EMV terminal because the financial network rules are going to change and it’s the smart thing to do.
And at that point you really want to say hey am I getting the most out of this environment what else can I do? And that's where I'm really excited about the work that we’re doing on payment as a service and on commerce enablement.
That's where things come together.
And so yes I do expect that hotels I do expect that restaurants I do expect that shops and retailers of all sizes would want to engage in that kind of dialogue.
That's what we’re building the company to do.
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor from Autonomous Research.
Paul Marc really appreciate the color and the transparency in what's going on there.
So thank you.
Paul on the last call you mentioned you were supplementing your existing positions with merchants with some of your new solutions.
It’d be pretty useful if you can give us a sense of when your customer -- when your incumbent customers have implemented a mobile or let's just say a ‘emerging solution’ what percent of the time are they using a VeriFone solution? Glenn we want to make sure I understand the question.
Certainly we are globally in dialogue with a couple of different types of customer segments right.
We have certainly direct relationships with merchants where we are in their offices talking about what they're trying to do online and in their stores and how they want to make use of all the latest and greatest mobile capability.
And so we are out there talking to them about EMV PIN contactless NFC currency conversion we’re talking about the complete gamut of things.
We find that more and more people are receptive to talking well beyond just give me the lowest price for the terminal and here's the basic need that I have right.
They are engaging us more widely.
In other segments we find that people are still very much somewhat myopic I would say.
They use our terminals as part of an overall solution and they are not looking to us to deliver the overall solution.
They got other providers integrators ISVs and so forth and that's absolutely fine as well.
We find ourselves collaborating with some of those to provide some of our technologies but we’re not the ones doing in front of clients selling.
So mPOS as I think I mentioned in the past was something that almost everyone is talking about they want to know how to take from the terminals into the lane a full-service ECR type of environment.
They want to have the full catalog of products on it and clearly we are partnering with people that have the capability.
We’re developing our own and we’re loving that conversation because it really does take us deep into the value stack.
So we’re continuously having those.
We've had a number of flagship wins with clients folks likes Sephora folks like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch American Eagle and these are premier brands and they’re not just talking to us about our terminals they are talking us about how we can create an environment that helps them to lift sales right helps them to change their commerce environment.
We love that right.
We are building a company to do more and more of that in a way that is not selling it’s more collaborating.
And if we have the right product great if we don't there are others who we partner with that can provide it.
Just a follow-up there.
So I assume when you're upselling these products into merchants it's additive to revenues and margins.
Do you have any sort of rough stats as far as okay when you do something like this when you upsell a new mobile solution into a merchant on average you might get a 10% lift in revenues per customer or 5%? Is it a notable amount? Because some of these merchants obviously they pay you a lot of money because they're big customers.
Does this stuff move the needle? It moves the needle.
I’d love to be able to be precise and I'm not able to be so I apologize.
So I am not going to guess with this.
Just intuitively obviously our terminals have a price point which is comparable to many other manufacturers that are also out there producing good quality stuff.
When we talk about a more robust full solution that includes field services that includes commerce enablement services that includes end to end encryption it's a little bit harder to stack VeriFone side-by-side and put us into reverse Dutch auction bid.
And so realistically for us we know the terminals give us an advantage.
We know the terminals are what people know us about.
When we get into these payment as a service and commerce enablement discussions we tend to do better in terms of margin and we tend to have a more robust and sticky relationship.
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.
Hey guys thanks for taking the question.
Wanted to talk a little about the operating margins which did come in a bit ahead of where we were expecting and I would guess where our consensus was as well.
As you continue to ramp the revenue run rate during the duration of the year and get a little bit of leverage off of the elevated OpEx base I mean where do you think we can exit this fiscal year in terms of operating margins Marc? Okay Jason thanks; appreciate the question.
So what I've been saying and I am going to be consistent with the operating model I expect that we will make as you say sequential progress in terms of operating margin performance throughout the year.
And it’s a result of two major factors obviously the leverage on the growth and keeping the overhead structure balance at $535 million of OpEx that we provided are in our supplemental guidance.
I think that when you look more towards the second half of this year I would expect that gross margins would improve it will improve.
And there’s a number of factors that are driving that.
We are starting to see some more leverage in our supply chain both on the procurement side as well as some of the areas like logistics and repair.
So it will be modest but there will be improvements it would be our expectation in the second half.
And secondly with the product refreshes that we've talked about we talked about Brazil new products towards the end of the year we’re doing some interesting things in Australia as well.
And then there's a new products being certified in the North American marketplace in CMB class A certification to help with our ISO channel.
So I think combination of the leverage in sales in particularly North America which is a good margin -- has been good margin mix for us should help improve the operating models.
I think I'll let you do the work on the modeling but I think that color in terms of the gross margin enhancement and the OpEx data that we provided I think you'll come to see that the margins will improve a bit from Q1.
And then just a two-part follow-up on EMV.
I know you gave us the stat on what percent of your Q1 shipments were EMV compatible.
What would you estimate in terms of the current overall installed base in the U.S.
what percent is already EMV compatible? And then can you just help us understand how much per terminal incremental revenue VeriFone can earn when the existing base of EMV compatible terminals actually get -- when you actually write those up with the EMV functionality.
Because my understanding is that most of those have not actually been let up yet.
Let me take the first part of the question relative to be installed base.
So as we mentioned the products that we shipped this quarter was 70% and that obviously all the MX 900 series we’ve been talking about these are EMV capable.
We think the numbers and you’ll probably see different data out there but the data that we’ve triangulated around with our own installed base is in the 20s in the 20% in terms of market that's overall EMV capable with the numbers that are the big installed base that Darrin highlighted earlier.
So now as we get into 2015 and October 2015 with the liability shift we will begin to see not only the incremental terminals come into the marketplace but some of the other product start to churn further into EMV capable.
I would say that I don’t think there are really precise numbers out there.
But being in the market every day we get a pretty good sense where tier 1s have pretty high percentage of their terminals especially multi-lane that are EMV capable.
But they are not turned on right.
They have the capability to turn on but they are not turned on today.
When you go down market it becomes fewer and fewer and then certainly at the smallest merchants who are very important because the small businesses that make up the bulk of consumer commerce they don't have any yet.
And so there is a pretty important transition plan that will happen in the U.S.
If you look at other markets it takes years and I was in a meeting recently with some -- I think real subject matter experts in terms of where EMV is going and people are saying gee it’s going to be five to eight years before what we have is a 90% operationalized consumer terminal infrastructure that’s all EMV.
That’s not out of the question.
That’s assuming that the financial networks are going to remain at what they said is going to be the October of 2015 date where liability shifts.
I think the financial networks I think the issuers and certainly the merchants are taking this as seriously as I have ever seen them and I think they are committed.
I think they are thankfully all now working together as opposed to being fragmented in their thoughts and actions.
I think they are starting to come together and I think they are starting to make headway.
Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
I just wanted to drill down perhaps a little bit more on Jason's EMV question just taking a step back.
I think you'd mentioned that perhaps you sold in aggregate perhaps around 1 million EMV terminals over the last three years.
Paul if I understand correct me if that's a bad number but if you think you might sell 3 million over the next three years do you still maintain that there's unlikely to be a demand pull-forward that influences North American organic revenue growth? Hey Andrew I apologize maybe it’s just me but I couldn’t hear your question.
Maybe you are on a cell phone.
Do you think you can try to repeat it maybe a little slower? Sorry.
Is that -- hopefully that's a little better.
I apologize.
I'm in an airport.
I was just wondering and I heard you say or heard VeriFone discuss having sold about 1 million EMV terminals over the last three years.
If you mentioned that you might sell 3 million incrementally over the next three years are you still asserting that there's unlikely to be demand pull-forward or accelerating North American revenue growth from EMV? Yes let me -- this is Marc.
Hi Andrew thank you.
Let me just clarify the 3 million units that we highlighted.
We said that we believe that there will be 3 million additional EMV terminals that come into the market new EMV terminals for the industry not for VeriFone over several years.
So just to clarify that and that Paul may want to add additional color on top of that.
Yes I mean I think from a trend point of view it's important that 70% of the terminals we sold in the United States in Q1 are EMV terminals.
It's also important that we believe strongly that that trend will go higher.
In other words we expect that we are going to sell even more EMV terminals as a percentage of terminals we sell in the United States right.
So I think that that trend a) well-established b) is accelerating.
In terms of the number of EMV terminals that we have already sold in the United States I actually do not have that number off the top of my head.
But I would imagine it’d probably be a bit more than 1 million in total.
And just generally I guess qualitatively it sounds like from your prepared remarks Paul you feel like you were now safely past sort of the triage stage if you will of VeriFone's turnaround.
Is that -- would you -- if you were to kind of give us maybe a baseball analogy how many innings do you think we're into the solidifying the foundation the rationalization of the product portfolio and just operational excellence? Andrew thanks for the question.
Look I think I candidly I am not anywhere near the last innings of this ball game okay.
It is still early at best I can say in the middle.
I certainly no more today than when I spoke to you last but I think I know less than I really need to know.
So there is a 24 x 7 effort going on with this team to get data right.
We have not always been rich in data as a company and we are not going to make decisions based on anecdotes.
We’re going to make decisions based on data going to make decisions based on what our clients tell us.
And so I’ve now met with about 100 clients I’ve spent a lot of time talking on the employees suppliers and I'm getting their take on what needs to happen.
And we’re certainly interjecting our own vision and our own sort of creativity on the topic.
But these are still early days there's a lot that’s changing this industry.
We’re just trying to make sure that VeriFone as a company that can take full advantage and not have any excuses for missing opportunities.
And that's where we’re at.
So I'd say middle inning out of a nine inning ballgame fourth fifth something like that.
Your next question comes from the line of Meghna Ladha from Susquehanna.
Paul since you joined the company back in September you've been traveling extensively meeting your customers and employees around the world.
Can you share with us some of the key themes that emerge from these meetings where do you see the biggest opportunity for VeriFone longer term in an industry that is so rapidly evolving? Meghna thanks for the question.
It’s actually really a fun question to answer.
My favorite thing in the world to do is to be with clients and people in the field so as much as I think San Jose is a wonderful place I learn a lot more by being in an office with a client who is working on challenge.
So more often than not you'll find me there.
In my initial travels first of all I think it's very important that at least for me that that – and Marc has traveled with me so he’s become my travel buddy.
We have been extraordinarily well received by clients and employees anywhere we go.
And there's a lot of enthusiasm for leadership for clarity for just listening – listening sitting and saying what do you guys think is the opportunity what do you see as the biggest thing that we could be doing better? And you’re just amazed at how articulate and thoughtful and complete some of those answers are.
And so I feel real good about the fact that we at least have created forum after forum for being able to listen.
In terms of what people are excited about I would say they want to see VeriFone get back into the business of innovation right.
They want to see us take what we see in the market across the globe and provide it to them in the market where they are trying to succeed.
All right.
Because we operate in all those countries our clients and in fact our employees expect that the benefit of being part of a global organization is that they are going to see that.
They are going to see that experiences and it’s going to be made available for them so they can run with it.
Very very important and candidly because the company was operated in such a fragmented way because communication was not high on the list of things to do they are hungry for it.
And as a result of our employees being hungry our clients are hungry for it.
And so that I think is a key theme.
In terms of biggest opportunity as I said we’re organizing the company by global P&amp;Ls global business lines.
We’re organizing it in a way that is first and foremost meeting the needs of our clients right.
Our clients are hey table-stakes produce a great terminal make sure it works make sure it’s o secure and make sure it meets my needs.
You know check check check we’re doing that.
Secondly some of us don’t want to operate and buy a terminal we want to operate our stores and our websites we want somebody else to do the payments element of it and we recognize that things are moving much faster in payments than they ever have been and we recognize that there are real risks out there with things like cyber attacks.
So rather than buying a terminal we want to buy service and that’s why we are moving into globalizing payment as a service.
And finally you can't help but get excited as a client when you're seeing all the innovation out there and there's more in addition moving into payments than I've ever seen in my 20+ years in this business.
And so we’re moving more of our budget R&amp;D budget from legacy product innovation we are listening and working with our clients and we are saying look we think we can give you the bulk of what you want on commerce enablement without in any way anyway compromising your security and that is golden for them right.
What they don't want to do is run after a shiny object only to find out that it's not secure or it opens up other risks that they haven't even thought about.
And so working with VeriFone I think is for them a comfortable safe and smart way to go.
Hopefully that helped.
All right.
Looks like we have time for one more question; that comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.
My question is as follows.
So for the MX900 series can you just remind me of the most -- the quarter just reported how many new retailers or how many new installations I guess I should say were there number one.
And then as a -- to flush that out what kind of trajectory should we expect going forward? Hey Wayne this is Marc.
On the number we don't have the detailed number of retailers.
I would just say again we’re making very good progress in terms of competitive wins and as I mentioned new deployments of really new new where there weren't customer facing terminals at that particular customer’s point-of-sale.
So I think the momentum first is really good and in fact in light of the security breaches and EMV in general I think this is going to be a catalyst for us in North America in particular in the second half of 2014 and going into 2015.
So when you look at the guidance that we provided upwards of now $1.81 billion you could expect that part of that uplift from Q1 and Q2 will be North America based.
No I apologize Wayne why don’t you finish your thought? I appreciate that direction.
It just seemed that in some quarters you guys had announced a number of new retailers I think the previous quarter was seven or so and before that it might have been higher.
So I'm just kind of wondering about the potential trajectory.
I know it's lumpy hard to tell quarter-to-quarter.
I wasn't trying to call anything out negative.
I was trying to think about something longer term on how that might look.
So that was my -- the nature of my question.
No it makes total sense Wayne.
I think it’s the question you know the MX series does a lot.
It’s EMV it’s NFC it's got this very powerful communication layer and a terrific screen on it got the right look so forth and so on.
So I would imagine more applications for it especially with retailers who see that point-of-sale as more than just being able to take payment.
Certainly there's no lack of interest in the series.
There is no lack of interest in how people are imagining it in use cases.
I mean we’ve recently started to talk about what that device would look like in a taxi.
We talked about what that device would look like across not just retailers but service providers.
So it feels like the right device for the time and I for one think it's going to continue to do well.
Unfortunately I can't tell you specifically I think the numbers that you're looking for I just don't have them on hand.
If I could just sneak one more in.
You guys mentioned working on a lower end product for China.
Totally understandable.
Can you give us an update on how Lenovo is doing? I thought you guys made a big splash with that a couple quarters ago.
Just interested in any thoughts on that.
I think just on the first part China we highlighted the need for us to have a low-cost product in our portfolio.
So clearly that’s the focus and obviously that could expand outside of China into other markets or other emerging markets.
The deal in terms of tablets and the like that we’re continuing to provide product around our E series product 300 -- the 300 100 series products and certainly you will see those devices wrapped around a number of Windows and Android and Apple devices certainly in the future.
Paul highlighted some flagship wins so I think you'll be pleased to see us making progress in mobility along those lines.
But I don't have any particular data Wayne on Lenovo deal.
Obviously that's pretty sensitive.
I would also just close on by saying that the amount of time that people are now taking evaluating these things have to take into account any and all concern about security right.
So before we saw the news on the breaches I think it was a different kind of analysis that people are doing.
I think that they were a little less sensitive to the fact that they are taking a terminal into the aisles and it's got an android or a Microsoft or aisles open platform type of environment operating on it.
Now with what we’ve seen in the market you can be sure that they are asking 10x the number of questions.
They want to be 100% sure it's industrial-strength secure and that we welcome that.
That falls squarely into our wheelhouse.
This is why you talk to VeriFone.
So it just I think takes a little longer.
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude the question and answer portion of today’s call.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Paul Galant for closing remarks.
Yes and thank you very much operator.
Appreciate your helping us out today Philip.
Thank you again for your time today everybody.
We are looking forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter.
I want to urge and make sure everybody knows that we are in the middle of this process.
We are by no means done we have a lot of work ahead of us.
It's hard work and I kind of explained it to some as it looks like overall in a potato field and I will maintain that’s exactly what it's like.
But we are going to get it done and stay with us and thank you for your questions today.
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s conference.

Thank you Doug and good afternoon everyone and thank you again for joining us today.
Last quarter I’ve outlined for you VeriFone’s vision and our commitment to become our clients most trusted most secure and most innovative global partner by delivering the best terminals payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement solutions.
I also discussed our work to fix our foundation and the work we're doing to turn VeriFone into the company that we want to be a company that is defined by five pillars.
Number one client first two operationally excellent three strategically focused four properly organized and five operating with a single distinct culture.
Today I will walk you through the progress we have made on each of these five pillars and we will review in detail the execution against our top three global transformation initiatives that are critical for fixing our foundation and supporting our drive towards our second pillar which is operational excellence.
We believe this work is already producing meaningful results to our clients our shareholders and our partners.
Quarter-by-quarter we are making progress on becoming one VeriFone.
As work to fix our foundation is well underway we are now starting to draft our next chapter strategy to deliver growth.
This strategy is aimed at helping our clients to drive new revenue by leveraging our payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement solutions as a core expansion of our ubiquitous and secure terminals.
And while we work to transform VeriFone we continue to win new client business and find ourselves increasingly at the whiteboard with our clients as they develop their growth plans.
I'm proud of the team here who are not only working hard on defining our future but also have increase their focus on our clients today which has again allowed us to exceed our financial guidance the revenue and earnings per share as well as free cash flow.
So let me now peel the onion a bit on execution against our first pillar in becoming the company we want to be.
To us becoming client first means being our clients most trusted most secured and most innovative partner.
And the company they called first when they have a challenge they need one opportunity.
I have now spent the past eight months traveling the globe to meet with many of our clients to build the deeper understanding of their perspective on VeriFone.
And I’ve done this because we all believe the voice of the clients is critical and central to very business decisions we make here at VeriFone.
Based on our client’s feedback it became clear to us that putting a relationship management model in place where we have a senior season professional assigned full time to our largest and most complex global clients would make it fundamentally easier for those clients to work with us.
To that end we have created a team of relationship managers who are advocates for the partnership we seek to have with our clients.
This investment in this group will allow us to do more business with the clients we already serve today and capture additional wallet share.
We’re working to fill these roles internally from the ranks of our trusted most experienced colleagues.
So far we have assigned relationship managers to our top 15 clients.
Our goal is to have relationship managers working with 20 clients by the end of the year.
I will do a deep dive on our second pillar becoming a company that is operationally excellent.
So let me come back to that because I do want to spend a lot of time on it.
And in focusing on operational excellence I want to talk to you about our top three transformation initiatives which support this pillar.
But again before we get to that let’s talk about our third pillar.
That’s being strategically focused.
With the clear articulated next chapter growth strategy focused on payment as a service and commerce enablement client solutions.
As we have discussed at a high level our strategy is to connector our terminals into our industrial strength secure payment-as-a-service platform capable of hosting VeriFone as well as third-party developed commerce enablement applications.
Think of this like a VeriFone hosted app store for merchants.
We’re building a platform where merchants can quickly download and deploy payment and commerce applications to capitalize on new opportunities to capture additional revenue and grow their relationships with their end consumers.
We intend to fund these investments with the cost savings we’re generating from our operations and productivity initiatives.
I look forward to updating you about the details of our next chapter strategy on upcoming calls.
The third pillar is to be a company that is properly organized with a streamlined organizational structure built around three global product businesses.
First our terminal solutions business; second our payment-as-a-service business; and third our commerce enablement business.
And we’re making good progress in defining these three organizations.
These three businesses are each building their respective global teams and are actively involved in shaping VeriFone’s next chapter strategy.
I am also pleased to report that we continue to strengthen our leadership team with the addition of June Yee Felix who will serve as President of our Europe region.
June joined VeriFone on May 26th and comes to us with the track record of building and operating successful large-scale businesses at Citi JPMorgan and IBM.
June is based in London.
Next I'd like to discuss building a single distinct culture at VeriFone.
As I visit our offices around the world it is clear to me that there are many elements of our culture today that we all hold in common.
These include a very strong client orientation entrepreneurialism and a commitment to excellence.
One change that we’re trying to make to our culture is a greater sense of accountability and clarity of roles and responsibilities.
Our VeriFone scorecards play an important role in this.
Last quarter we ticked off this scorecard process with my direct reports each of whom is now cascading this deeper into our company.
Today a total of 50 including all my management committee members and a significant number of senior managers are operating with scorecards.
Our goal for 2015 is to have this rolled out and operationalized with our top 200 executives.
Let’s now turn back to our second pillar being an operationally excellent company.
Our focus here is to create a globally optimized operating model fixed to needs of our clients.
We believe we can achieve this in large part by executing our top three global transformation initiatives.
Those being one portfolio -- product portfolio management; two R&amp;D reengineering and three cost optimization.
Let me start by saying that we expect these three initiatives to create a minimum of $35 million in annual run rate savings by the end of calendar year 2014.
As I mentioned earlier we intend to reinvest most of these savings in new growth areas in our three core product lines where we believe we can achieve significant returns on investment.
In product portfolio management which is our first of the three initiatives we’re starting to process of removing from the market the legacy product that no longer best serve our clients’ needs.
Last quarter I told you that we had completed the vetting process for VeriFone more than 1000 product family SKUs.
This is a process that must be done very carefully as you can well imagine in order to meet our commitments to our clients many of whom rely on being able to buy the same product from us for many years.
As of today we are well underway reducing our product SKUs from over a thousand to less than 500 by the end of this calendar year.
This includes successfully transitioning clients off of legacy PCI 1.3 products that were sunset beginning on the PCI mandated day of April 30 2014.
Reducing the number of legacy SKUs in the market allows us to focus more of our development capacity and innovation on building the next generation of market-leading VeriFone products.
In keeping with our strategy these global products are on the leading edge of payments technology security design and capability.
They cover the range of market needs and price points and above all our market set in to facilitate our growing payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement businesses.
We will unveil these important new products on a regular basis over the course of the next 18 months.
Building these new products of course requires us to continue execution of our second transformation initiative that being R&amp;D reengineering.
I described last quarter our existing R&amp;D footprint consisted of 1800 R&amp;D employees across 75 individual sites globally supporting 13 core terminal operating platforms and several more platforms for our non-terminal products.
We know this is far from ideal and likely unsustainable.
It impacts our efficiency and we’re in the process of finalizing our plans to co-locate our engineering talent in global centers of excellence placing them in a same room to drive collaboration and innovation and focus them on fewer core platforms.
We have already identified 10 R&amp;D sites from which we will be relocating staff to these global centers of excellence by the end of the year.
And this is just the start.
As we make progress on reducing operating systems and hardware platforms we will have further opportunities to consolidate our R&amp;D footprint.
Additionally our R&amp;D organization is of course already hard at work developing the next-generation platform for future products.
Unlike the 13th platforms of our current product portfolio our new terminals are based on a unified hardware and software platform.
Our next-generation hardware will come with faster processors larger memory and leading-edge security capabilities which will enable our products to have best-in-class levels of functionality.
Our modular extensible and reusable software platform will facilitate both VeriFone as well as our partners to quickly innovate and provide better end-to-end solutions to our end clients to merchants.
So what does this really mean? Well at the end of the day for our clients it means higher quality more state-of-the-art terminals for not only accepting card swipes and PIN codes but also to build and run commerce enablement applications that help them bring in new revenues.
Our next-generation terminals and operating system will help drive incremental commerce across physical mobile and online channels with instant reward redemption royalty programs couponing and targeted offer programs to name just a few.
We are hard at work developing a comprehensive migration plan to affect a seamless transition for our clients who wish to leverage these expanded capabilities.
These platform development efforts represent major investments and you will be pleased to know that they are already well underway.
We now have test products running in our labs and we expect our first product using this new robust global VeriFone platform to be released to clients in production by the end of next fiscal year.
Our objective over the next few years is to move all of VeriFone core terminal products onto this one platform.
Our third initiative is cost optimization.
This initiative provides much of the fuel we need to fund our transformation and execute our next chapter strategy.
We are continuing the difficult task of looking at every aspect of our business to identify opportunities to reduce overlap in efficiencies and currently we have a pipeline of over 100 cost savings projects which we are working to execute.
As a result of this work we have made the decision to reduce our headcount by approximately 500 people by year end from 5 800 at the beginning of this calendar year.
This decision was difficult but necessary.
And we began executing during Q2 reducing our headcount by approximately 150 people thus far.
As our transformation progresses these actions are necessary and will create savings with a significant portion to be reinvested in strategic initiatives over the next 12 months.
While such decisions are always difficult to make we really sweated every single one.
We believe that this is in the long-term interest of our company as it will increase our speed to market our operating efficiency and most of all our competitiveness.
We are making progress in other areas of cost optimization well beyond headcount as well and are hard at work redesigning our shared services model for our back office functions.
We expect to close 10 of our 129 facilities liquidate 19 of our 132 legal entities and consolidate 20% of our datacenters all by the end of calendar year 2014.
There is more work to do and we will continue to make VeriFone more efficient well beyond the targets that I've described for you through the end of 2014.
As you can see there is a disciplined and data-driven effort underway to transform VeriFone and we are beginning to go from PowerPoint to actual on the ground execution with clients.
And we are making tangible progress in the plans that we have laid out for you.
At the same time we are continuing to win exciting new client engagements.
Let me cover a few of those.
In our terminal solutions business we are continuing to see an increased sense of urgency among large U.S.
retailers and merchants to accelerate a technology refresh in advance of any EMV related liability shift dates.
In the quarter 15 existing VeriFone clients selected our MX900 series EMV capable platform as Veri next-generation payment system.
And we began rollout at CVS and Kohl's.
Additionally we want another six clients from our competitors and gain three new U.S.
clients that adopted consumer facing payment systems for the first time in order to prepare for EMV acceptance.
Our clients know that when they buy VeriFone they get more than advised.
Our team includes some of the leading security experts in the industry who are at the whiteboard with our clients discussing holistic approaches to protect consumers’ data and our client’s brands and reputations.
We’ve also made some important senior hires to supplement our thought leadership and security.
I'm pleased to report that we've hired Joe Majka to be our Chief Security Officer to lead VeriFone’s Global Security Operations.
Joe has more than 30 years of experience managing security fraud cyber security and data breach incident response including other way leading Visa’s electronic payment data security team.
Additionally we’ve added Rob McMillan as our Global Head of Product Management for our security solutions.
Rob has spent nearly two decades in information security product leadership including as a leader in RSA where he helped introduce tokenization as a component of payment transaction security.
Rob will be working closely with our regional teams and clients to drive commercial innovation and deliver new VeriFone solutions to build on our promise of multilayered approach to security.
Demand for our secure integrated mobile point-of-sale solutions continues to grow as well.
In the second quarter six retailers including Nike Godiva Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and PetSmart agreed to implement EMV capable mobile solutions that integrate with some of the latest Apple devices.
Also in Q2 we launched the portable VX 690 the first of several new EMV capable devices to be built using our near design methodology that leverages an attractive consumer-based design and enables merchants to leverage NFC low-energy Bluetooth and many more additional mobile point-of-sale bandwidths.
This new terminal will first be available in Australia where we continue to see better-than-anticipated demand for our terminals through our partnership with several of Australia's leading banks.
Finally in Spain we continued to strengthen our partnership and expand our business with Redsys Spain’s largest processor.
In our payment-as-a-service business we are continuing to invest in rollouts in select new markets.
In Q2 we signed the payment-as-a-service agreement with Turkish Airlines that includes a combination of our new secure payment devices software helpdesk field services and secure IT infrastructure in a subscription-based model.
The Airline will roll this out across its 250 owned and thousands of agent branches.
In Australia/New Zealand the work to enable payment-as-a-service continues with two substantial projects well underway with our bank clients and both are expected to go live in fiscal year 2015.
In the U.S.
the rollout of payment-as-a-service continues with wins at the 250-store sandwich chain which and several large independent software vendors who are instrumental in the process of penetrating mid-market merchants and retailers.
And in Sweden happy to report we signed agreements with two new Tier 1 retailers.
All in all we are seeing exciting traction from this payment-as-a-service business model that we believe offers great security and value to our clients and opens up new growth avenues for VeriFone.
We are actively working to expand VeriFone’s payment-as-a-service offering to new countries and we will be reporting our progress on upcoming quarterly earnings calls.
And finally I want to give you an update on commerce enablement.
Last quarter I told you about how commerce enablement business will drive activities beyond payment creating more valuable experiences for and more interactions between merchants and their consumers.
This includes increasing awareness of our merchants and the products they sell enabling others to leverage our terminals peripherals and gateways to deliver innovation at the physical mobile and online point-of-sale and making the point-of-sale much more secure.
Digital media is a critical capability that enables successful commerce solutions.
The ability to effectively target and provide tailored offers from merchants to consumers in real-time at the point-of-purchase creates exciting new opportunities for our clients to grow revenues and see an immediate and direct and measurable return on their ad and marketing dollars.
And it’s an opportunity for VeriFone to leverage our substantial consumer facing assets to influence consumer purchasing behavior for the benefit of our clients.
One area we're delivering on this promise today is our global taxi business.
In the quarter we moved our digital taxi top products from pilot to expansion in market in New York City.
In our first three months we had eight participating advertisers and sold a 100% of available inventory beyond this exciting new product.
Highlights include a really cool program by the way which provided near real-time NCAA tournament score updates on the screens as cabs navigated through New Your City streets.
We believe that the potential for our taxi business extends far beyond what we’re seeing today.
Future investments in this commerce enablement platform could unlock scenarios where for example taxi passengers are influenced to go directly to a retailer based on the digital ad that offers a product discount and a rebate on the cab fare that brings him there.
Based on the success of our initial launch we will be expanding the number of tops in New York during Q3 and we will begin expansion into the Las Vegas market and we will be launching a pilot program in London.
We will start experimenting with ways of using all of our digital media assets to drive immediate incremental sales for our merchant clients.
Another such area that we continue to invest in is building the scale of our petrol media network.
Our innovative in-store upselling platform which we called LIFT Retail increased site count by 38% versus the previous quarter and were now installed in over 1 600 locations.
Our petroleum forecourt platform increased active screen count by 24% and is now installed in 4 800 pump screens.
Today the screens are enabling scenarios where consumers can be incented at the pump with targeted ads to purchase goods inside the convenient store.
Then once in the store consumers receive additional real-time offers.
We are seeing increased excitement from our retail partners around both solutions and we are going to continue to invest to scale this network.
As you can see we continue to make progress on our path towards becoming our clients most trusted provider of secure terminals payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement solutions.
We have more work to do and more investments to make but I am really pleased with our progress in executing our strategic plan.
I will now turn the call over to Marc.
Marc? Thank you Paul.
Consistent with the company’s best practice we will be referring to certain financial statement information on a non-GAAP basis.
For the second fiscal quarter we are very pleased with our results and the progress on our key financial metrics.
We reported net revenue of $467 million exceeding our guidance of $440 million to $445 million.
Our net revenues were up 9% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.37 also exceeding our guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per share.
This compares to non-GAAP earnings per share last quarter of $0.31 and $0.42 a year ago.
I will now discuss our regional results.
Our North American revenues were $125 million compared to $122 million last quarter.
Our Q2 sequential improvement reflects several factors.
First our U.S.
multi-lane retail business grew sequentially.
We continue to see strong demand for our core integrated retail offering the EMV capable MX 900 series with the number of large rollouts and competitive takeaways during the quarter.
Second our small and medium business unit was also up slightly sequentially.
Additional certifications were achieved in Q2 and more are expected in Q3 which should begin to build more momentum with our clients.
Third our taxi business was comparable sequentially.
We continue to see growth in transaction revenues as a result of the continued addition of taxis to our network but this growth was offset by normal seasonality in advertising revenues.
And finally in North America our U.S.
petrol business revenues were down from last quarter as clients deferred purchases as we transition to our EMV capable solutions.
Our certification product roadmaps are in line to support the shift and we expect improvement in Q3 and beyond.
Turning to Latin America.
Revenues for the second quarter were $83 million up 22% sequentially primarily driven by Brazil and Mexico.
Brazil was up significantly in Q2 compared to Q1 due to competitive wins with both major acquirers.
Q2 shipments from these wins were in excess of what we anticipated and were key drivers to our revenue exceeding guidance.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues of a $191 million were up 2% sequentially.
We continue to improve in this market and have enhanced our product and service portfolio and continue to see results.
We saw strong sales in Spain as a result of completed certifications enabling market share gains in that country.
Sales in the Middle East and Africa were strong as Nigerian banks expand the cashless society initiatives.
And finally turning to Asia Q2 revenues were a record $68 million up 12% on a sequential basis driven by strong sales in Australia where demand was stronger than expected as our clients accelerated their terminal rollouts.
Now let’s discuss results by line of business.
Revenues for system solutions were $291 million in Q2 up 4% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially.
Service revenues were $176 million in Q2 up 17% year-over-year and comparable on a sequential basis.
Service revenues represented 38% of total revenues in Q2.
Primary drivers of the year-over-year revenue growth continue to be clients moving to our payment-as-a-service solution growth in the U.S.
taxi market and our prior year acquisitions in New Zealand and France.
Turning to gross margin performance for these lines of business our consolidated gross margin was 41.4% a decrease of 100 basis points from our first quarter.
The sequential improvement in our system solutions gross margin from 40.1% to 40.4% of revenue reflects improvement in our supply chain activities including better inventory management partially offset by changes in geographic mix specifically in Brazil which contributes lower gross margins.
Service gross margin decreased from 45.7% in the first quarter to 43.1% in Q2 as a result of service lines mix specifically seasonally lower advertising revenues and increased fixed cost investment in ramping our taxi and payment-as-a-service businesses.
Consolidated operating expenses during the quarter were $133 million an increase of $1 million over Q1.
Let’s now discuss our capital structure.
At the end of Q2 our cash balance was $230 million and net debt was $710 million lower by $42 million from Q1.
We are very pleased with our progress of reducing our debt by utilizing both our free cash flow and our tax efficient repatriation of offshore cash.
In addition we had just launched a process to refinance our outstanding obligations.
We expect this refinancing to extend the term of our facilities reduce near-term repayment obligations improve pricing and provide more flexibility with our various covenants and terms.
Subject to market conditions we expect to close this refinancing in Q3.
In addition for Q2 please refer to our maintenance covenant ratio of calculations posted on our IR website for more details on compliance with our credit agreement.
Moving on to more information on the balance sheet and working capital.
Accounts receivable balance increased by $38 million to $301 million on higher revenues and our accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased sequentially by 4 days to 58 days.
Our inventory decreased sequentially by $8 million to $113 million and inventory measured as days of inventory improved again by 7 days to 39 days.
Accounts payable ended the quarter at $147 million an increase of $37 million quarter-over-quarter on higher revenues and cost of goods sold and an increase in days payable of 9 days.
Our overall cash conversion cycle improved significantly by 12 days sequentially and 29 days year-over-year to 49 days.
Now let me focus on or highlight our working capital as a percentage of revenue which also improved to 14.3% from 15.7% last year and 20.1% a year ago.
We will continue to have a sharp focus on working capital management.
Turning now to cash flow performance in the second quarter of 2014 cash flow from operations was $57 million and our free cash flow was $36 million approximately 86% of our non-GAAP net income.
Our second quarter capital expenditures were $21 million including approximately $12 million from revenue-generating assets mainly equipment supporting our payment-as-a-service and taxi businesses.
Now let me discuss our financial guidance.
For Q3 we are guiding non-GAAP revenues in the range of $455 million to $460 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.33 to $0.34 per share.
For the full fiscal year 2014 we are increasing our prior guidance and now expect revenues in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.835 billion and earnings per share of $1.42 to $1.44.
Also we continue to expect free cash flow generation for the full year to be approximately 95% of non-GAAP net income excluding the Q1 legal related settlement payment.
Please refer to our Slide 19 in our earnings presentation for more detail on our guidance as well as additional forward-looking financial information.
As Paul discussed earlier we are continuing the difficult task of looking at every aspect of our business to identify opportunities to reduce overlap and inefficiencies.
As a result of this work we have made a decision to reduce our headcount by approximately 500 FTE by the end of this calendar year.
The expected one time cost of our transformation efforts including severance related to these activities will be approximately $30 million of which $20 million will be spent in fiscal year 2014 including approximately $6 million which was already paid in Q2.
The expected annual savings will be at least $35 million.
We do intend to use a substantial portion of these savings to fix our foundation and fund our strategic growth initiatives.
In the coming quarters we will update you on the progress in our 2015 annual guidance.
Thank you.
And with that I will now turn the call back over to Paul.
Thanks Marc.
On my first two earnings calls I outlined the case why VeriFone is a company that really matters in payments.
I also laid out the plan for transformation to fix our foundation and to unite us as one VeriFone.
And I highlighted our objectives as well as upcoming milestones that would indicate we’re making tangible progress.
There is no question we have a tremendous amount of work to do.
But we know from our clients and we know from our employees that we’re making real progress.
And we remain committed to driving the changes necessary to become our clients most trusted most secure and most innovative partner and the first company that they call for terminals payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement.
At the same time we’re drafting our next chapter strategy to leverage our global scale our security and our prominence in the commerce value chain to be the platform that helps merchants drive incremental revenues and precision and measurable returns.
I look forward to sharing our continued progress in future conversation.
With that I’ll ask the operator to please open the call for your questions.
Thank you.
(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from line of Tien-tsin Huang.
Please proceed from JP Morgan.
Great.
Thanks.
Good afternoon.
The slides are really helpful.
Let me ask about the cost optimization I guess the $35 million in savings? It will be more than what we are thinking initially.
I’m curious the path to getting to the $35 million I mean what will it look like as we exit fiscal year for example? Can you give us some flavor on when you will achieve that $35 million? Thanks Tien-tsin.
This is Marc.
Okay.
Let me start with the restructuring obviously this is a difficult for us to do here.
But as I said we are in every aspect of the organization and what I and Paul have spoke to is a 500 net headcount reduction by the end of this calendar year.
The ultimate savings we believe we will get from that 500 headcount is around $35 million possibly even a little bit more.
What we intend to do in 2015 is to reinvest in terms of fixing the foundation issues type two or three initiatives particularly in portfolio management and very much so in R&amp;D.
What I would say in terms of moving ahead to 2015 we have modeled our 2014 to be approximately 29% -- our OpEx is about 29% of sales.
And although we haven’t set the 2015 full guidance yet and I don’t have an absolute number for you on OpEx what I am thinking about or what we are going to indicate is that with the leverage of improve sales going into 2015 we believe that OpEx as a percentage of sales should be down by about 100 basis points.
But let me be clear as we execute these headcount reductions we expect to invest reinvest a significant amount of savings into the initiatives and the growth platform.
Marc just to be clear on the reinvesting that excluding or including the severance that you had laid out and maybe if you can just give a little bit more detail on the reinvesting I mean are we talking about hiring some people after the 500 folks are we talking about buying some software or licenses are bringing some consultants to do the work? Just try to give a better understanding of what significant might mean mathematically? Thanks.
Sure.
From a reinvestment standpoint I would view it as more of a variable cost.
We will be looking at outside services contract labor there maybe some incremental hires at the end of the day as well and all the above like you mentioned.
Like I mentioned as well Paul and I will be in a better position as we progress into Q3 and Q4 to provide more information and the next savings going into 2015.
But for now given that it’s early days we have an intention to indicate that it’s going to be reinvested -- substantially reinvested.
I would just add a little bit to what Marc said when we are going from 13 operating systems to one.
That is a software endeavor obviously.
And it involves a lot of integration work with clients that already have applications that they have written on one of the 13 operating systems that might be going away.
And so middle layers translation services all of those things.
They are not always people that you have in seats today that are expert to this kind of work and yet you need that level of expertise.
So we are going to be positioning the type of skill set that we need for a period of time.
I agree with Marc when we can we will use contract labor because they distinct thing that need to get done we want to go from 13 to one.
And then we want to start building on that one and making available on that one the future of application development and in that case you probably going to have a larger group of software experts and know how to do commerce enablement type of solutions not core payment type of solutions which we want traditionally on terminals so that we can accept cards right.
So a little bit of a shift in resource and talent.
Got it.
Yeah.
We can work with that because it sound like some of that will be temporarily labor to work through it.
Okay.
I appreciate that.
Thank you Tien-tsin.
Thanks.
Your next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.
Please proceed.
Yeah.
Thank guys.
Congrats on the continued progress.
Just a question on the outlook here so it looks like the guidance calls for revenue and EPS to be lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter? So I’m just wondering if that’s a function of some pull-forward of revenue in Q2 which you kind of eluded too? And then along those same lines if I have my math it looks like the full year revenue guidance is being raised by something more than the amount of the beat this quarter in Q2 or you are raising the EPS guidance I believe by a little last than the amount of the Q2 beat? So any comments on that as well would be great? Yeah.
Thank you Jason.
Thanks for the compliments on the quarter as well.
We will take it.
We appreciate it.
With respect to Q3 it’s down slightly from the $467 that we printed for Q2.
So we are guiding the $455 to $460.
Two things going on there one is that we did have accelerated sales to customers in Australia that was part of the benefit or the unplanned increase in Q2 and we expect that to have an impact our Q3 sales.
So Asia in particular we are estimating to be down sequentially from Q2.
North America just to give a little bit more regional color I think will be up slightly with the continued momentum we spoke about.
Latin America for planning purposes we had a great quarter actually in Brazil.
It was the best quarter we've had in the last two years in the Brazil marketplace and we’re planning for Q3 to be at -- to be down slightly.
So just to be succinct it was be another good quarter better than we had initially planned.
But it’s down from Q2 given the color that I just provided.
And for the full year 2014 it's substantially higher than what we had guided to last period.
Certainly recognizing the revenues that we beat by in Q2 and in terms of the $1.40 per share that we’ve guided to the $1.40 to $1.44 is reflective of the $0.05 or $0.06 beat but also the takedown in earnings per share for Q3 that I just discussed.
Okay.
Understood.
And then can you just give us the latest summary of where you are at with remaining product certification on your roadmap here? I know you mentioned a couple of more forthcoming in U.S.
SMB and I'm assuming that the next-gen product in Brazil is still on track for your Q4? So if you can just catch-up there that would be great? Yeah.
I think everything is on track.
So all the items that we discuss to do in the last two quarters obviously we are making a lot of progress it’s a function of focusing our resources to make sure that these client demands are met.
And so we get up every morning saying on time every time with high quality and that’s what we got to do.
So a lot of folks are toiling away to get that done.
The things that are left for Q3 we did in the priority order.
We wanted obviously certified terminals that our largest most critical clients have been patiently waiting for got that done and have now started to focus on areas that you know like the SMB space where we have a lot of opportunity but we just tell we didn't have the resources to do everything at the same time.
So we’ll be continuing to do that for the balance of the year.
Everything is on track everything is on plan.
In some cases we're doing it early.
Certainly in the case of Brazil like we’re happy to see that the team is making progress a little bit ahead of plan.
Thank you Jason.
Your next question will come from the line of Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities.
Please proceed.
Yes thanks for taking my question.
When you had with large retails of 15 plus the six competitive takeaways how much of that’s been rolled out.
What’s the timeframe for rolling out? I'm assuming these are the bigger retailers with the larger number of terminals to roll out.
How long is that process going to be in and how much of that was sense of urgency around EMV versus normal upgrade cycle? Well let me take that.
I think Marc’s got more detail on it because I have been speaking to a lot of clients.
There is absolutely a sense of urgency to peel the onion on how secure the point-of-sale environment is at all these brands.
It’s top of mind.
It’s what their CIOs wake up worrying about.
It’s what their boards are asking the fields about.
So there is tremendous activity.
They are walking around with clipboards and they are really getting to the details.
As I mentioned we are fortunate to be getting the first call.
We’re at the white board with them discussing it and they are not kicking the can down the road as perhaps some of them were a year ago.
So today if they are able to put in a new terminal -- a new terminal solution they do.
They're not putting it in purely for EMV purposes because it’s -- they earned a lot of EMV cards out there.
They are putting it as part of a comprehensive redo where they are doing encryption on an end-to-end basis where they are talking about securing their website and making sure that none of their customer data is ever in the clear.
So it is -- EMV terminals is the way we articulate the fact that they've done something but it's not really because they want an EMV terminal a year before cards are going to be out or any time before the liability shift data solidified.
It's really because it's part of upgrading the security of their environment and they are not waiting to do that.
Hey Gil.
This is Marc let me just give a little color on your question on timing.
There's diversity in terms of the timing of the rollouts in general.
What I could add is that the order input is absolutely better than it's been over the last 12 quarters and it aligns with what we’ve talked about.
Well Paul has just mentioned in terms of front and center top of mind relative to the liability shift.
So the momentum in the retail business in North America is excellent.
Got it.
And as a follow up on your cost optimization you talked about taking out the 500 of employees by the end of this year.
But in terms of the facilities and the consolidating of the SKUs and the legal entities what’s the timeline for getting those done? We’ll make some progress on all those this year.
In fact we've made some progress through the first -- for the first half covered number of facilities that we’ll be exiting 10 or so by the end of this year.
Legal entities we have 130 plus we’ll be out of 19 or so by the end of this year.
So it’s all hands on deck in terms of optimizing the end-to-end cost structure.
With Paul I did today was give some color on some specifics.
But this is -- this is as you can imagine multi-year assets and it’s not only a function of driving cost out of the system for which activities will certainly do but it also helps to remove some of the complexity across this organization.
One thing I would just like to add is as you consolidate from 13 operating systems to one and as you reduce hardware products SKUs significantly and you standardize on chassis which have almost everything in common irrespective of where they are deployed you can create a lot of change in how quickly you can get your things certified.
Today when we have to do certifications we’re having to manage it on 13 operating systems which is why I say sometimes we just don't have the resources to do the certifications across all those.
When you get to one it’s much more predictable that you can get your stuff certified in markets.
So this is a data driven exercise that VeriFone is going through.
Everything is prioritized.
There is a pretty disciplined process for execution and we will continue to report progress I wish with instant but it's not.
It just takes a long time to do this right and do not have your clients have their business impacted.
So that’s what we’re doing.
Thank you.
Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.
Please proceed.
Hi guys.
Thanks for taking my questions.
On the executing of the top three VeriFone initiatives; the product portfolio management R&amp;D reengineering and the cost optimization.
I guess two-part question.
Just one clarification on that is that the all three of those totaled the 35 million or is it just the cost optimization piece? And then secondly is there a revenue impact at all from these initiatives? On the first part of your question the $35 million savings to be reinvested goes across all three initiatives.
In terms of the second part of your questions on revenue the reason why we have Master PowerPoint and have done a lot planning was because we wanted to avoid the revenue going away.
So as we make these plans there's a lot of dialogue with each client that's impacted by a product going away and we’re providing for that client alternative solutions.
In most instances the solutions do more than the item that is going away and provide some better set of functionality.
Thus far in the cases we presented to our clients they have kind of -- I guess they are wondering what took us so long.
So they really like what we’re showing them in place of what they have and we’re making it easy for them to say yes.
And so we're not expecting a lot of revenue leakage through this process there might be some but it's really that we haven’t seen much of it today anyway.
Okay super.
And just last question on gross margins Marc can you talk a little bit about mix can you talk about what gross margins what we can expect kind of going forward as the model revolves here? Thanks so much.
Thank you Bryan.
I gave a pretty good color I thought in the presentation on Q2.
But to be specific to your question going forward for Q3 and Q4 we expected to be relatively consistent in Q3 and as we get into Q4 with improvements in both revenue and leverage particularly on the supply chain side I expect the revenues to tick up slightly revenues to gross margin tick up slightly in the fourth quarter.
And then as we get into 2015 we will provide more color.
But clearly getting more leverage out of the supply chain and removing the complexity is where we hope to capitalize on.
Appreciate the question.
Thank you.
The next question will come from the line of Phil Stiller from Citi.
Please proceed.
Hi guys.
Thanks for taking my question.
First I guess I wanted to focus on the payment-as-a-service business.
Can you give us the growth rate in the quarter and I guess how materially you think some of these new markets can be over the next year or so? Well Mark is trying to find the growth of payments-as-a-service in the quarter.
I can tell you that we are going through sort of a three-step process with our payment-as-a-service business.
One is we have this Nordics business called Point and when you peel the onion on that business you realize that in some part it grew out of their own acquisitions.
And so we do have somewhat different types of payment-as-a-service approaches some different types of software that can do the same sort of thing.
And so we are homogenizing and trying to get to the best-of-breed across all the Nordic markets.
The second is to take our non-Nordic payment-as-a-service businesses many of which grew up independent of Point and trying to figure out what elements of the excellent work that the folks at Point have done would improve those businesses places like Israel places like Mexico so forth and so on.
And as you know we have some new markets Australia New Zealand and we're trying to get to a global model.
The area around new markets interestingly enough there was never a global approach to payment-as-a-service.
So when I came in I expected to see a heat map like our stack ranking of the next best market for us to go into is this or not it wasn’t there.
And it wasn’t there because we really never product management managed this area.
It’s now being product managed it’s now being run globally and we now have a heat map of countries.
And the markets that we have launched next may not be the biggest markets but they have the highest probability of creating value for the clients that we serve that want to do that sort of thing in those markets right.
So obviously the U.S.
is the largest market and although we are working in the U.S.
it wouldn’t probably be the first place that we would try to do a lot of payment-as-a-service work because there are other markets where there is real pent-up demand.
It’s a little bit of an easier process for us.
And so not a straight answer but I just want you to understand the framework and approach that we take to this.
Mark? And just thanks as well on the question.
Just on payment-as-a-service the total services business was $176 million so is comparable to the prior period.
In that I had mentioned that the advertising revenues were down sequentially and the other side of the equation was payment-as-a-service up slightly.
Okay.
That's helpful.
And then switching gears the cash flow conversion you guys have made a lot of progress on that over the last year or so.
Is that something that you think is at a sustainable level or can further improve from here? What are the expectations as we move forward? So we are happy about the continued improvement at working capital and driving the net amount down in cash conversion cycle to be 49 and it hasn’t been there in a very long time probably 10 years for VeriFone.
I think it's about where it belongs.
It’s going to ebb and flow it could go up a few days.
It could go down a few days depending upon geographic mix on receivables in particular.
I am pretty comfortable relative to the growth rates that we are assuming in our outlook that the working capital targets where we are today are probably where we will be for a while.
It was an incremental improvement.
It is going to be a little bit more challenging but our goal is to keep it around where we are today.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Your next question will come from the line of Mike Grondahl from Piper Jaffray.
Please proceed.
Hi guys.
It's Dain on for Mike.
I just had a question after going through the -- just kind of really big transformation in R&amp;D functional all that.
I was just curious if you could highlight maybe some of the checks and balances that you’re going to starting to make sure that in future you don't have an issue with certification related and that kind of things.
Are you guys probably looking for that relatively speaking? Yeah.
I’m happy to take that.
I’ve been spending a lot of time with our R&amp;D had a look to notes and our three global product managers in the case terminal and certification it is Bill Nelson who runs terminal solutions for us globally.
The first thing is visibility and transparency and the fact is that right now I am able to look at a dashboard that shows me where we are across all the product lines where we are in certifications.
It is a weekly cadence that we review where we are in all that.
And we are not trying to beg borrow and steal resources from one country to another to get the stuff done.
So it’s much more planned much more anticipated much more data-driven much more stack ranking our priorities.
And very very good feedback mechanism like lumpy business reviews weekly transformation meetings weekly management meetings lots and lots of transparency on scorecards.
And Bill Nelson has in his scorecard making sure that all the terminals that we have in the plan are certified on time and that they have high quality and everyone has the same thing.
So I think we’re putting good checks and balances obviously they can always be better.
And I think in this case we’re better by virtue of how long we road test them and how we adjust them over the period of time.
But I still feel like we've got good (indiscernible) suspenders today.
Okay.
And it looks like too you said it actually reduced even more of those SKUs from call it first quarter to this quarter.
So I think before you had said 250 and now you’re going to -- it looks like you are going to reduce even double that number is that correct? Yeah.
That’s right.
What I want to do is I want to give you all the transparency of what we learn as we go through our process.
And thus far our hypotheses have turned out to be right but dimensions of the numbers we are starting to see a better result.
Part of why we’re little nervous because we just didn’t know how the client side was going to react.
And given the fact there is so much concern around security there is so much concern around updating and making sure people are best-in-class.
When you go to someone that has an old terminal and you say hey we’d like to replace it with the new terminal and it has the following benefits they’re inclined to do that.
And so because of that we've been able to be a little bit more comfortable in pushing to reduce product SKUs.
So that's the way it’s going to continue.
And Dain just to add a little bit color.
Also part of the benefit that we had in this update was the sun-setting of certain products that were under the PCI 1.3 standard.
So as those products if you will sunset or sunset it on April 30th and also was helpful in SKU reduction and eliminating some of the VeriFone complexity.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thanks Dain.
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen we have time for one more question and that question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Please proceed.
Hey guys.
Thanks for taking the question.
You make me dig down a little bit in the pile here.
It’s nice to see Latin America really shift over Brazil in particular.
Could you kind of give us a sense of how share shifted pretty far away from VeriFone during the dark days and how far how close are we to equilibrium now and how much more is there to go in Latin America in terms of share shift among those two big customers down there Brazil I guess in particular? Yeah.
Happy to take that question Andrew.
Latin America is important as well as super important given the fact that it’s got two of our biggest customers in the world.
I think that there is -- there are two answers to your question.
One is there is a relationship angle here.
The fact is we did not invest in the relationship with these folks.
I think we didn't do a good job of listening to them and understanding their priorities.
I think we made decisions without engaging them on product on price on timing.
And I don't know of a single client who is going to be happy doing business with some one that doesn’t listen.
It doesn’t matter what price you give.
If you don't listen and you're not willing to be a partner to help them build their business to succeed they are not going to engage with you.
So don't underestimate how messed up that was because I think it was pretty messed up.
The second was we -- as you know I think there was a period time where VeriFone was managed as a stock and not as a company those are my words and decisions were made to not spend money to show terrific earnings and in not spending that money we didn't do what we needed to do to have product ready certified.
It is a very intense process as you know to certify a product and you need to have the right people you need to have the right investments.
But if you pull that back you don’t have an immediate hit you got a hit couple of quarters down and that’s what happened to us.
So we're not going to kick cans down the road.
We are not going to cutoff nose despite -- we are going to manage this as a company for the benefit of its clients and in doing that we will be ready with the products that they need because we will listen to them we will prioritize them and we would been upfront.
No saying we are going to it and they are not showing up.
Just discipline and just a different I think maybe more mature way to run this business.
Though it sounds like perhaps your there's more room to go I guess in terms of repairing the relationship hence the ability to drive revenue growth? I am just trying to understand because you had a big sequential uptick in things like you fixed a lot of the share issues there but it feels like there is perhaps additional… Yeah.
… is that the right way to think about it? We fix the relationship before we fix the product.
So we realize that we were not doing a good job being a good partner for this client.
So we stepped in very early in the process spent a lot of time with these clients and so that what’s happening before we have product to sell them.
As the product became available they decided to do business with us and give us another shot and we've done nicely thank goodness we've been able to capture most of the share back there's probably a little bit of upside I would say.
But I think it could be lumpy I think we can have one good quarter one less good quarter.
But certainly back in full consideration and let the product quality and solutions and services now be the factor that causes us to win share not self-inflected rules causing us to loose share.
We want to win based on the fact that we have the best product and have a great relationship with the client and I think we are now poised to at least have that as an opportunity.
Okay.
And I know there are lots of moving parts in gross margin market sounds like Brazil might have been the single biggest sort of headwind to product gross margin was up sequentially all else being equal do you think your product gross margin continues to expand how much we can think about mix how much is mix influence gross margin over the next couple of quarters as… Thanks.
So on gross margin the mix absolutely was the single biggest challenge in terms of the Q2 results and the margin the mix obviously will play clear role or impact the results in the rest of this year as well.
I think we are doing a lot of good things in terms of the supply chain.
There is lot of optimization efforts underway.
The inventory levels coming down from $189 million a little bit more than a year ago to $113 million has certainly not -- we certainly cleaned out a lot of the challenge that we've had over the past few quarters.
So I'm looking forward to improvements in general.
But clearly mix is going to have an impact.
And then I also just not leave you hanging but on the services side it’s the same thing advertising revenues on the fixed cost platform as they go up or down that upward obviously be helpful to the margins but as they move around it could have the opposite effects.
So what we are trying to do and I am trying to do here Andrew just give enough color in our guidance to give you net direction in terms of where we think the margin is going to be.
As I mentioned earlier to Brian I think Q3 will be relatively flat to where we were in Q2 and then there is an opportunity for some enhancement in Q4.
Okay.
And I assume some of that enhancement Q4 probably reflects the revenue generating capabilities of some of the services investments with taxicab et cetera this quarter.
That’s correct.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
Thanks very much Andrew.

Thank you Doug.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.
During last quarter's earnings call we reviewed VeriFone's execution roadmap to become the company that we want to be One VeriFone a company that is client first operationally excellent strategically focused properly organized and driving a single distinct culture.
We shared details on how we are fixing our foundation by revamping our terminal solutions and payment-as-a-service businesses.
As I stated when we launched our companywide transformation effort back in January fixing VeriFone's foundation is indeed our top priority.
To this end we have been pursuing a highly disciplined execution effort driven daily across every part of our firm.
That execution effort has continued to advance progress on our top three VeriFone initiatives portfolio management R&amp;D reengineering and cost optimization.
As we execute these initiatives we are making progress transforming into an integrated global product company delivering client solutions incorporating terminal solutions payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement.
These global product lines are now supported by a single global R&amp;D team.
Together they are working with our more regional client franchises in 150 plus countries.
This new organizational structure is led by experienced and strong leaders each of whom carries an individual scorecard and if delivering tangible improvements in our organic growth in our quality agility innovation and cost efficiency.
While we have been executing our transformation in parallel we been architecting and during this past quarter have started to execute VeriFone's next chapter strategy with the formation of our commerce enablement business.
I will provide more details on this in just a few minutes.
But before I dive in I am pleased to report that the company continued to perform well during the third quarter as we grew our business and again exceeded guidance on our key financial metrics.
We grow our topline by 14% from a year ago.
This is a good result and one that signals that our plan is working and that the global market for terminals is growing as also evidenced by the overall strong performance of the terminal solutions industry.
With this latest result we have grown revenue and earnings sequentially for four straight quarters.
We have improved our free cash flow and balance sheet metrics and have reduced debt by 17% in the past year.
Additionally during Q3 we refinanced our outstanding loans with improved economics as well as terms and conditions.
My partner Marc will provide more detail on each of these shortly.
Much of our success in the quarter can really be attributed to our transformation efforts as well as to the strong execution against our top three VeriFone initiatives.
And while we know that we have much more work to do to live up to our potential our global team is executing well and is on a sustained path towards operational excellence.
Let me update you on a few key areas.
First we have made meaningful progress in our cost optimization initiative.
Last quarter I told you about the difficult decision we made to reduce our core business headcount by 500 people from a baseline of 5 800 people at the beginning of this calendar year.
We continue to make progress in this effort and to-date have reduced headcount by nearly 375 and remain on track for our end of calendar year goal.
To-date we delivered significant savings much of which has begun to be redeployed to focus and strengthen our foundation and drive future growth.
We are also making strides in other areas of cost optimization and operating efficiency.
To-date we have now closed 14 facilities.
We have liquidated 13 legal entities and continued our data center consolidation and we remain on track to accomplish our end of calendar year goals detail the individual scorecards of the top 250 people at the company.
Also we have recently divested certain non-core assets specifically our highly customized and client specific GlobalBay enterprise offering and the ChargeSmart online bill pay business neither of which fit into our vision and strategy for the future of VeriFone.
These businesses were not significant to our financial results.
Second we remain focused on product portfolio management and are developing our future product roadmaps for our three global lines of business.
Our terminal solutions business is actively driving SKU reduction and has established a global product management model for prioritization and decision-making for investment and resource allocation.
We remain on track to execute our SKU reductions and client notifications by the end of the calendar year.
To-date we have sent out end-of-life notices for 278 terminal configurations.
We discontinued significant products in connection with the PCI 1.3 transition and reduced our ongoing terminal products SKUs from over 1000 to approximately 525 on our way towards sub-500 goal.
This reduction has included individual communications with approximately 1 000 clients all of whom I am happy to report are supportive and continue to remain VeriFone customers.
And third we are moving forward on our R&amp;D reengineering initiatives improving our product quality and time-to-market and we have consolidated nine of our 75 R&amp;D locations towards a goal of getting to 30 R&amp;D centers of excellence around the globe.
Additionally we have reduced our 13 platforms for our terminal solutions business to now eight active platforms mostly as a result of the PCI 1.3 phase out in April and we continue to make meaningful progress on the development and migration to a single next-generation VeriFone platform something that we will discuss in greater detail on future earnings calls.
Supporting our transformation and our next chapter strategy growth plans require us to have the right leadership and the right talent in place both inside the company and at the Board of Directors.
And while we are driving efficiency and headcount reduction throughout VeriFone we are upgrading talent and have begun making strategic additional hires in a number of key areas.
In fact over the past two quarters we have added three very talented and highly respected individuals to our Board of Directors to ensure that our management team has access to experience and leadership from experts who can help us become the company we want to be.
The new directors are Karen Austin the current CIO of PG&amp;E and accomplished expert in IT and change management with significant retail operations experience Jonathan Schwartz the former CEO of Sun Microsystems who brings proven operational and strategic expertise with a very strong background in technology and solutions and Jane Thompson the former President of Walmart Financial Services who brings essential knowledge of payments as well as valuable insights on the evolving commerce relationship between merchants and consumers.
In addition during this past quarter we made several replacements and additions to our management team in order to support our strategy.
Vincent Roland previously General Manager of our business in France has been promoted to lead our global payment-as-a-service organization.
Before joining VeriFone Vincent was the CEO of Banksys and an SVP of EMEA at First Data.
Todd Shaw has joined us from PayPal to become our Chief Human Resources Officer and lead the development of our global people platform.
Richard Char and Gary Greenwald have joined us from Citibank.
Richard will lead and create our successful technology industry partnerships as our Head of Global Business Development while Gary will lead the development of our next generation of software architecture.
Sheetal Shah and Mark Shockley both joined us from Motorola Mobility with Sheetal leading our Global Supply Chain and Mark working with our terminal solutions organizations to lead our mobile product line.
With the addition of these folks we now have most of the key senior management positions filled.
We continue to see great client success stories across our company.
The market share of our terminal solutions business is growing in the U.S.
both in the multilane retail as well as the small and medium business verticals as well as in many other countries outside of the U.S.
Although not yet perfect we continue to make improvements and progress in accelerating our product certifications.
For example in France BNP Paribas has selected VeriFone as its supplier for countertop terminal solutions a truly great win for our newly certified solutions in a key strategic market.
And in Canada our unattended payment devices were the first to achieve certification under the latest Interac standards for contactless payment specifications.
Our distribution partner Moneris which provides solutions for use in the unattended market in Canada and the U.S.
is releasing its next generation unattended solution supported by our UX devices.
Also we continue to lead the U.S.
migration towards EMV acceptance and EMV migration continues to drive sales for VeriFone.
Last quarter we upgraded 14 top retailers to our MX 900 series of EMV devices.
This included an order from one of the world's largest retailers for 40 000 EMV MX 900 units.
More than 80% of our products shipped in the U.S.
in Q3 were EMV capable up from approximately 70% in the first quarter.
It's important to note that a similar percentage of our terminals in the U.S.
included embedded NFC chips and the migration to EMV will certainly significantly increase the installed base of NFC terminals and the potential for the use of NFC in payment and commerce moving forward.
Additionally our message of a multilayered approach to security is resonating strongly with merchants and last quarter alone 10 top retailers selected to implement our end-to-end encryption solution VeriShield Protect.
Our joint implementation of this solution with our partners Vantiv was recently recognized by The Banker a Financial Times publication as the 2014 Technology Project of the Year in Risk Management.
We grew our terminal solutions business in key strategic markets as well.
In China we won a tender in Q3 to provide approximately 75 000 countertop PIN pad and mobile devices to ICBC the world's largest bank.
You will recall that we talked on prior calls about introducing a set of lower-cost products in China to bolster our competitive position in the region.
In Q4 we expect to have our first such device in pilot.
In Germany we signed a deal with ROSSMANN the country's second largest drugstore chain to deliver thousands of our H5000 terminals designed specifically for the German market.
In our payment-as-a-service business we experienced growth in a number of merchants and acquirers outsourcing their terminal management to VeriFone.
We are increasingly leveraging our payment gateways to connect merchant terminals in order to efficiently route transactions simplify monitored device operations and enhance payment security and compliance.
And we are advancing payment-as-a-service in several strategic markets.
For example in Turkey we signed a payment-as-a-service deal with English Home a home décor retailer with over 200 lanes.
In the U.S.
the increased focus and importance of EMV and security is driving demand for our payment-as-a-service offering as merchants acquirers and integrators are becoming increasingly interested in our secure devices as well as an easier path to enabling EMV acceptance managing the intensifying risk posed by cyber criminals and reducing the burden of compliance obligations.
Our payment-as-a-service offering in the U.S.
incorporates EMV terminals with a greatly simplified certification process along with end-to-end encryption to protect cardholder data at the device level and backend to reduce the scope and cost of maintaining PCI compliance.
In the quarter we saw wins at Haverty's Big 5 Sporting Goods Community Choice Financial and Ten Thousand Villages.
We believe that this payment-as-a-service solution is proving to be an important driver of growth for us in the U.S.
We are also seeing continued migration for payment-as-a-service in the Nordics Australia and New Zealand with the number of devices connected to us growing quarterly.
In a world of ever-increasing payment complexity and risk merchants are clearly seeing the value in outsourcing more of their payment operations to VeriFone.
In commerce enablement we expanded VeriFone's capabilities in robust consumer markets by leveraging our secure payment terminals and other VeriFone assets to help merchants and advertisers influence consumer purchase behavior prior to and at the point-of-sale.
Commerce enablement elevates VeriFone's devices and services far beyond secure card acceptance by providing our clients with tools that help them leverage our terminals and digital media screens to attract new consumers and grow sales by effectively closing the loop between traditional marketing and commerce.
To accomplish this we are working to link our millions of smart terminals digital media screens and technology gateways to create a commerce enablement platform to drive consumer purchase behavior and enrich the commerce experience at our clients' brick and mortar stores.
Our devices act as last mile end points of this network spanning the many countries where we deliver solutions.
This VeriFone commerce enablement platform gives all of the control to our merchants and aims to improve the precision and effectiveness of their marketing to create an in-store experience at least as good as what consumers have learned to expect from their shopping experience online.
To build this platform we are establishing digital media screens across key real estate where consumers conduct their daily life.
Whether it is four minutes at the gas pump or 20 minutes in a taxi ride we are working towards enabling merchants and brands to communicate with consumers and deliver value-added targeted offers that can be redeemed at any merchant enabled VeriFone terminal.
Our execution of this strategy accelerated this past quarter as we grew our platform of digital media screen enabled fuel pumps.
We have recently signed deals with Sunoco with Tesoro and with Citgo three leading fuel retailers.
In total the three agreements will grow our digital media screens at the pump and inside the C-Store by tens of thousands with the opportunity to reach many more in the years to follow.
Today our economics are derived from traditional advertising delivered through these screens.
As our commerce enablement platform evolves we will grow additional revenues through system sales and potentially by earning commissions for delivering incremental sales for our merchants and brands.
An important step towards executing this next chapter strategy to place a few weeks ago when we announced the global partnership with Gilbarco Veeder-Root the world's leading petroleum dispenser provider.
This deal is significant both for our terminals as well as our commerce enablement business.
In our terminal solutions business it creates opportunities in the U.S.
petroleum market for us to provide our EMV terminal solution in connection with the 2017 EMV liability shift in the petrol marketplace as well as new opportunities for international growth.
In our commerce enablement business this relationship also resulted in an immediate increase in our digital media coverage by 20 additional screens at the pump.
Beyond petroleum we were rewarded new agreements to expand our global network of media capable taxis.
As one example a material win in Istanbul will result in 18 000 licensed taxis leveraging VeriFone's full suite of services.
We expect both petroleum and taxi wins to begin to roll out in late 2015.
Looking forward we are expanding the functionality of our terminals making them commerce ready.
This includes arming them with enhanced screens beacons and feature-rich gateways.
Additionally our engineering team is developing a secure and certified VeriFone application store that will provide clients with VeriFone and third-party developed tools to help them manage and grow their business.
We believe it will make our terminals an attractive platform for developers to innovate and VeriFone will develop its own innovative apps as well.
For instance we are linking targeted offers made on our digital media screens to consumers' cards and smartphones and facilitating their redemption at our merchants point-of-sale terminals.
I will demo an early production version of this platform during my keynote speech at this year's Money 2020 conference in Las Vegas in early November.
As you can see we are continuing to make progress.
We are executing on our transformation and we are positioning the company for long-term success.
At the same time we are keeping our eye on the ball.
We are investing in innovation and winning back our clients' trust and delivering improved financial performance.
We certainly have our work cut out for us over the coming quarters and we are becoming a much improved company and our clients have started to see a better VeriFone.
Now before I hand it over to Marc one important housekeeping point.
Although we have the leadership and strategy in place to be successful and running VeriFone by global product line we are still in the process of completing certain organizational and finance infrastructure changes.
Once we are able to measure ourselves by global product lines likely in fiscal year 2015 we will then begin reporting certain financial information to you by those product lines.
Until then we will continue reporting our results the way we evaluate ourselves internally by geography.
With that I will now turn the call over to my partner our Chief Financial Officer Marc Rothman.
Thank you Paul.
Consistent with the company's past practice we will be referring to certain financial statement information on a non-GAAP basis.
For our third fiscal quarter we are pleased with our strong results and the continued progress on our key financial metrics.
We reported net revenues of $476 million exceeding our guidance of $455 million to $460 million.
Our net revenues were up 14% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially.
Additionally organic constant currency revenue was up 13% over the prior year.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.40 also exceeding our guidance of $0.33 to $0.34 per share and this compared to non-GAAP earnings per share last quarter of $0.37 and $0.24 a year ago.
I will now breakdown the results by region.
In North America revenues were $130 million up 3% sequentially and 12% year-over-year.
Our Q3 revenue improvements reflect several factors.
First in the U.S.
petro business revenues were up sequentially from last quarter as we saw strong demand for two of our high-end product offerings for the convenience store.
As Paul discussed earlier we have won significant business in our petro vertical including entering into a new relationship with Gilbarco on future payment platforms for which we expect to see a contribution to our petro business in late 2015.
Second our small and medium business unit was up sequentially for the second quarter in a row as we benefited from the increased number of certified products in the marketplace.
Also we added several new sales personnel dedicated to this market to address new business opportunities.
Third our U.S.
multilane retail business continues to remain strong.
Demand continues for our core integrated retail offering the EMV capable MX 900 series.
14 large retail brands selected our MX product this quarter and included four key competitive takeaways.
Our strengthened in petrol SMB and multilane retail was partially offset by lower non-digital taxi top advertising revenues in the quarter due in part to the shift to digital advertising and general market conditions.
Turning to Latin America.
Revenues for the third quarter were $89 million up 7% sequentially and 28% year-over-year.
Similar to last quarter we showed improved results in both Brazil and Mexico.
Our businesses with our major Brazilian clients was particularly strong and encompass both payment terminals and related services.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa revenues of $190 million were comparable sequentially and up 6% year-over-year.
We saw increased sales in Russia and Poland.
Nigeria was also a highlight as the government support for electronic payment acceptance by retailers continues.
These highlights were offset by a decline in Turkey for mobile ECR terminals where we benefited in prior quarters from the initial uptake resulting from new tax regulations.
Finally in Asia Q3 revenues of $67 million were down 1% sequentially from our Q2 performance and up 27% from the prior year.
In China we had record revenues yet we continued to miss opportunities due to the lack of a low-cost product portfolio.
We have been working diligently on creating the right solutions for the market and look forward to the pilot of a new lower-cost device in China in Q4.
In addition results from Australia New Zealand and Greater Asia remains solid.
The positive performance in these countries was partially offset by lower revenues in India due to a stronger competitive environment.
Now let's discuss results by line of business.
Revenues for system solutions were $299 million in Q3 up 19% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially.
Service revenues were $177 million in Q3 up 6% year-over-year and comparable on a sequential basis.
Our primary drivers of the year-over-year revenue growth are customers moving to our payment-as-a-service solution and our prior year acquisitions in New Zealand which contributed approximately 2% of the services growth.
Turning to gross margin performance.
Our consolidated gross margin was 41.6% a sequential improvement of 20 basis points.
System solutions gross margin improvements were partially offset by a sequential decline in services margin.
Sequential improvement in our system solution gross margin from 40.4% to 41.3% of revenue primarily reflects favorable product costs.
Service gross margin decreased from 43.1% in the second quarter to 42.1% in Q3 as a result of lower non-digital taxi media revenues in Q3 and our continued investment in our payment-as-a-service platform.
Consolidated operating expenses during the quarter were $135 million an increase of $2 million sequentially.
This increase reflects higher investments in IT as we strengthen our infrastructure and accelerate the migration of our business to common platforms.
On the capital structure we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $264 million gross debt of $924 million and net debt of $660 million.
We reduced our net debt by $50 million from Q2.
In our last earnings call we discussed the initiation of our plan to refinance our debt which we completed in July.
The new agreement provides several significant economic and structural enhancements including a reduction in near-term principal repayments additional flexibility around operating at financial covenants extension of maturities improved liquidity and a reduction in interest expense.
Under this agreement we secured $1.3 billion in new financing comprised of a $600 million Term Loan A a $200 million Term Loan B and a $500 million revolving credit facility.
We have drawn $130 million under the revolver as of July 31 leaving $370 million of available borrowing capacity.
We also now expect interest expense to be approximately $1 million lower in Q4 as compared to Q3 as a result of the new terms and a reduction in our outstanding debt.
In addition for Q3 our net debt to EBITDA ratio as defined in our credit agreement improved to 2.7 times well below the 4.5 times maximum amount allowable under our new agreement.
For more detailed information on the covenant calculations please refer to the schedule we posted on our IR website.
Now I would like to discuss balance sheet and working capital metrics.
Our accounts receivable balance of $299 million decreased even as we delivered higher sequential revenues and as a result our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved slightly on a sequential basis to 57 days reflecting better revenue linearity.
Our inventory balance remained at $113 million and inventory measured as days of inventory improved two days to 37 days.
We will continue to focus on opportunities to improve days of inventory while we also enhance our client delivery metrics.
Accounts payable ended the quarter at $143 million a decrease of $4 million quarter-over-quarter representing a decrease in days payable at two days to 46 days.
We are very pleased with our overall cash conversion cycle performance highlighted by our continued sequential improvement in our sizable 33 day improvement compared to last year.
As a result of the continued focus on cash management working capital as a percentage of revenue also improved slightly to 14.1% compared to 14.3% of revenues last quarter and 19.7% a year ago.
Highlighting our cash flow results for the quarter in the third quarter cash flow from operations was $59 million and our free cash flow was $38 million approximately 84% of our non-GAAP net income.
Our third quarter capital expenditures were $21 million including $15 million from revenue-generating assets mainly equipment for payment-as-a-service taxi and media businesses.
And lastly before I turn the call back to Paul let me discuss now our financial guidance.
For Q4 we are guiding non-GAAP revenues in the range of $478 million to $483 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.39 to $0.40 per share.
For fiscal year 2014 we are increasing our prior guidance and now expect revenues in the range of $1.858 billion to $1.863 billion and earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.47.
We expect free cash flow generation to be approximately $25 million for Q4 and approximately $171 million for full year 2014 excluding the $61 million litigation payment we made in Q1.
Regarding our restructuring plans that we announced last quarter we have incurred $16 million to-date and we expect the overall plan to cost approximately $30 million.
Consistent with our comments last quarter we intend to use a substantial portion of our savings to enhance our business processes and infrastructure as well as fund our strategic growth initiatives.
We will continue to update you on our progress and plan to provide additional 2015 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in December.
Also please refer to slide 19 please of our earnings presentation for additional forward-looking financial information.
Thank you and with that I will turn the call back over to Paul.
Thanks Marc.
When I started at VeriFone nearly a year ago I saw a company that really mattered in payments and despite facing some challenges sat the position of the enormous potential in helping to define the future of commerce.
Our assets our market position and most importantly our people align this company well to lead an evolution that transcends payments and enables our clients to embrace the coming wave of data powered commerce enablement.
We are working tirelessly to transform our business and fix our foundation.
We defined a path to become One VeriFone a company that is client first operationally excellent strategically focused properly organized with a single distinct culture.
And we have shaped and are executing the next chapter business strategy that will enable us to build a sustainable growth business that is about much more than shipping terminals.
I have genuinely never been more excited about the road ahead for VeriFone's clients our shareholders and employees.
I hope that you can see that the VeriFone of today is certainly not the same company that it was a year ago.
Execution is key and we have much much more work to do as excitement and momentum are building within the walls of VeriFone.
Thank you.
And with that I will ask the operator to open the line for your questions.
Operator? (Operator Instructions).
Your first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.
Please proceed sir.
Hi guys.
Nice execution on the quarter.
I just wanted to start off with last quarter you came in above expectations and you had assumed that the fourth quarter would show I think a bit of a sequential step-down in Asia or Latin America after what was very strong quarters and pull forwards.
It looked like that surprise to the upside this quarter.
And so if we could just start there with one quick explanation is what was the surprise to the upside driving those two areas? I know you talked about China seeing some traction.
And then a follow-up China I think Paul or I wasn't sure mentioned with respect to the opportunity for the new low-cost product.
How big of an opportunity could that really be? Okay.
This is Marc Darrin.
Good morning and thank you.
Let me address the Q3 beat relative to the guidance and you picked up most of that from the numbers.
So we had a really good quarter in Q2 in Latin America but the momentum really continued nicely into Q3 particularly with Redecard in that marketplace more services and Mexico surprised us a little bit to the upside as well.
So coming off of a very very strong Q2 Latin America that momentum continued into Q3.
Same with the Asia-Pac.
It was a record order for us in Asia-Pac.
Last quarter it was down sequentially.
But Australia also surprised us again to the upside I think that will be a little bit more tempered going into Q4.
We have discussed a launch of the payment-as-a-service platform in parts of Australia and we are making a lot of progress there but the hardware is rolling out early as well.
So that surprised the upside.
And really North America as I said was really strong across the board.
Petro was certainly a highlight.
We had some softness in the past several quarters and we are starting to see the rollout of our product that was launched in the marketplace recently.
So overall it was really across the board but those three markets in particular Australia in Asia-Pac Brazil in Latin American and petro in North America that drove the nice upside.
And Darrin thanks for the question.
With regard to China we are not well-positioned in China.
China as a terminal solutions market is potentially larger than the United States.
Certainly is growing much much more rapidly.
And the type of product that the Chinese merchants and bank look for is a product that is at a different price point than what is really VeriFone's strength.
Now you know the technology and the scale which we operate certainly should allow us to produce a full line of lower-cost product that fits the China market fewer bells and whistles a little lighter on the operating system side.
And so we are working hard to get that right product into that market so that we can get our fair share of growth which I don't think we are getting today.
Okay.
If I can just ask one quick follow-up before turning it back? With respect to the upside you mentioned on EMV 14 large retailers coming in that still doesn't really address the increase in the addressable market yet.
Is that correct? In other words are these just really pull-forwards of large retailers saying they want to operate now? And then as part of that question your end-to-end encryption business has also been gaining traction.
Is that going to be something we need to watch out for at all with EMV rolling out because or tokenization anyway rolling out? So maybe two thoughts and I will leave it for that? But thanks again.
Yes.
This is Paul.
So the top 14 retailers that give us the wins selected our products for EMV those were the traditional retailers that we have had tremendous success with.
I think you know that in the Tier 1 merchants in the United States we have really built a wonderful franchise great relationships great product and a really big infrastructure that helps these folks get their solutions in their stores quickly.
With regard to your point around the additional pull through those 14 did not include the hospitality and the QSR side that we believe are still coming.
That's great.
And on the encryption business clearly Darrin anyone who is purchasing an EMV infrastructure today is looking for encryption as part of the whole solution and very very few times do we really talk about just a terminal sale there.
Got it all right.
Thanks guys.
Thank you Darrin.
Thanks Darrin.
Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Please proceed sir.
Hi guys.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Just to follow-up on Darrin's question a little bit regarding EMV.
Paul I know you have been reluctant to talk about a tipping point or a material pull-forward as we approach the liability shift deadline and now we read about another big high-profile data breach.
How do you characterize the pace of EMV adoption the slope of the curve currently as well as you think about the next few quarters leading up to the liability shift in what seems to be a very high-profile area given all the press around data and data security? Andrew thanks for the question.
Look I think it's pretty clear that the time for complete re-architecture of the point-of-sale environment is here and now.
It's in everyone's collective best interest to fix the issues.
And if you look at issuers who have now committed to providing chip cards as part of the Visa MasterCard work that you have probably seen recently in the announcement they made once you have the cards certainly merchants will have the terminals and these due dates that have been talked about I think are going to be solid.
And so you are going to have all the conditions that are really appropriate for an acceleration of rollout.
The bottlenecks have been certifications right because it is quite a cumbersome process to the certify EMV terminals across a very large landscape of issuers of card networks and of acquirers.
And so we have been at VeriFone working on everything to help the acceleration so that merchants can get their environments up and running and reduce their exposure to the cyber criminals.
So it's really been a lot of work grassroots effort a lot of information on the technology side and you probably as you heard now this speech this payment-as-a-service in the United States that we been putting forth more so is about being able to deliver that EMV quicker right.
It's not only showing up at the terminal but having that terminal certified and having that terminal encompass the full end-to-end encryption which is so massively important to protect our merchants' environment.
So I think it's happening.
I think it's going to accelerate but as of yet what I could tell you is I don't think we have seen the bulk of it happen.
Okay.
That's very helpful.
Thank you.
And then Marc if I may just around the guidance could you help us understand a little bit very strong revenue outlook not as much flow through perhaps to earnings per share in the fourth quarter? A little color there would be terrific.
Sure.
Thanks Andrew.
So just to reiterate the guidance for Q4 we gave revenue of $478 million to $483 million and earnings per share of $0.39 to $0.40.
So the revenue is up slightly on a sequential basis.
The margins are effectively comparable.
That's what we see to what we delivered in Q3.
I can give you a little bit more color on the revenues within that framework of the $478 million to $483 million.
I think there is going to be a continued momentum in North America.
So we will see a slight uptick really across all the verticals.
I do believe that Latin America will be more balanced in Q4 probably down sequentially planning that will be down sequentially and the Europe and Asia basically flattish.
Specifically on the EPS number and the flow-through although we are making really good progress Andrew on the restructuring efforts there is a fair amount of investment that's being made back into the business to talk about some of things that Paul mentioned media clearly we are spending investments on the media and commerce enablement platforms as well as payment-as-a-service.
I highlighted Australia as an example and going from 13 platforms to one the next-generation platform is another area where how we focus.
So there is a number of areas that require additional investment going into Q4 and that's what's having some small impact on the operating leverage and reflected in our guidance.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Thank you Andrew.
Thanks Andrew.
Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
Please proceed.
Hi good morning.
Thank you for the question for taking my question.
Just on the EMV and NFC side can you just update us on where penetration rates are today in the U.S.? and then I am curious if you are seeing more incremental demand for NFC today than say at the beginning of the year? Hi Tien-Tsin.
How are you doing? It's Paul.
Thanks for the question.
So real quick on the penetration so EMV in the United States is approximately 30% of the terminal base today.
So still an awful lot of terminals will still need to be converted.
In Tier 1 retailers where you get the largest quickest jump it's by and large already taken place.
Most Tier 1 retailers already have EMV in place and for them it's really about turning the system on as opposed to putting in terminals.
On the NFC side I think what you are seeing is most people in fact I think all people that buy EMV those terminals include NFC chips by and large.
So what we shipped in the third quarter almost every EMV terminal had an NFC chip in it.
It's not a terribly expensive piece of equipment and it safeguards you from my future opportunities.
You may see other things beyond by the way NFC right.
You may be seeing things like of low-energy Bluetooth.
You may be seeing things like barcode reading.
The fact is that nobody knows what the standards are.
And so I think that you will see us continue to innovate and if consumers show up with a device that communicates with a standard you could be sure that we will be on the other end of that standard pretty rapidly.
The other thing you should know is that just because they have shipped an NFC or they bought an NFC terminal doesn't mean the NFC is turned on.
And so an awful lot of the opportunity is to actually turn these things on.
Understood.
No that’s good to know.
That's helpful.
And then just wanted to confirm gross margins implied in the fourth quarter I think you said to Andrew would be roughly stable.
Just wanted to confirm that we are capturing the China impact and if this non-digital taxi media issue is going to persist? And then more specifically I was curious if you can give us just an update on the dollar run rate of savings that you are seeing from your initiatives and how much you have reinvested? It sounds like you are definitely have been spending as planned if not a little bit more which is good? Thanks.
That's all I have got.
Okay.
Thank you Tien-Tsin.
So on the gross margin outlook for Q4 it's relatively comparable to Q3.
Quite frankly we see both lines of business system solutions and services to be relatively comparable in those lines of business.
With respect to the savings the restructuring and run rate.
So we looked at $35 million annual benefit as it relates to the difficult headcount actions that we took as well as the work we are doing on infrastructure and really across the three initiatives.
So we are still holding on a $35 million run rate annual trajectory.
I would say we are probably more than halfway there Tien-Tsin.
But we are investing really all of that back into the growth and infrastructure work that we had discussed earlier.
Got it.
Thank you Marc.
Thank you Paul.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets.
Please proceed.
Thanks.
Good morning.
I just wanted to follow-up on the opportunity for turning on the EMV system.
I don't know that we have ever heard or at least I have heard you guys really talk about that opportunity in terms of size? And then really how you would actually get paid for that? Then secondly for the EMV kernels that need to be upgraded once you guys get these in place is that a recurring base of revenue for you guys? Or is that done outside your framework? If you could help me with that that would be great? Sure.
Happy to give it a whirl here.
So you buy a terminal you put in the terminal into infrastructure but you know 99.9% of the consumers are swiping a card as opposed to entering in a chip and paying it.
And so I think in practical terms whether you have it turned on or you don't have it turned on through the EMV feature the bottom line is it's not being used as an EMV device okay.
And so when we talk about turning it on it means that more consumers are showing up with an EMV chipcard.
And if you are seeing that flow you are taking sort of a quick pause to say okay have we optimized the system for that consumer chipcard.
The first place you look to is going to be security.
Are we at the point where the card touches that terminal immediately encrypting all of the financial information on an end-to-end basis meaning that it stays encrypted until it hits the acquirer.
And so that is an opportunity for us to create some more services for that client and that does have potentially a recurring revenue base.
I would say that you know the second thing that happens is that you have got a real question on certification.
The device that's there could be working just fine but it's not certified for EMV.
It's really certified as a magstripe reader.
And the question is how are you going to go through the full certification protocol.
This is where our payment-as-a-service offering can make it much easier.
By connecting directly to the terminal and encrypting everything that the terminal we are able to greatly simplify the certification process that a merchant and an acquirer need to go through.
So that's another area of potential annuity revenue stream that lead could create.
It's also a wonderful service for the merchant because their PCI compliance cost dropped quite a bit if we do that.
Okay.
If I kind of dovetail on that when we look at commerce enablement is that the same playbook in that? I am thinking as you roll out a network and you are starting to move consumer data or track consumer data or cardholder data is there another application layer of security that needs to be put around commerce enablement or will these other two services that you just described be your strategy to protect that? Thanks.
That's a really interesting question because you know when we talk about encryption we are really talking about the 16 digit payment information right.
And I think most of the industry today focuses on getting the live credentials out of the clear.
We want to encrypt those.
Over time and I don't think this is a 2015 issue but it is probably beyond over time you could see a world where all activities that consumers make with merchants can be viewed equally valuable equally in need of encryption in which case the encryption net grows quite a bit larger right.
So all the consumer choices all of their personal information anything not just financial data.
So to answer your question nobody knows.
Right now encryption focuses on getting the PAN the credit and debit card live credentials out of the domain of being clear.
That's really what it's about.
Commerce enablement for us I am glad you asked because I really think that it's something that we certainly need to prove is real.
We certainly believe it is but we need to prove it.
Commerce enablement is purely about attracting new consumers and selling more stuff right.
What could our platform do beyond just accepting a card payment whether it's EMV whether it's a tap and pay through NFC whether it's an old magnetic stripe we have really built an entire company out of helping merchants accept card payments.
So what we are shifting is we are saying what does that device do when it's not being tapped with a card or a card is being swiped through it? And this is where we came up with this idea of taking all these terminals in 150 countries and using them as network end points very powerful network endpoint no different than what Apple did with the iPhone when they linked them and created an app store.
They said okay not only do these devices make phone calls and do text but they can now be able to do a lot of other things through apps.
So that's the playbook we are riding and the digital media screens that we are establishing in key locations those give us the advantage of being able to communicate with consumers as they conduct their daily business and offer them things that they can redeem in our terminals.
Got it.
I just want to sneak one more in.
I am sorry.
You did get rid of GlobalBay but you kept GlobalBay Merchant I think.
Was that part of commerce enablement? Thanks.
I will jump off.
Yes absolutely.
Thanks for asking that by the way.
The global enterprise business really cool business it's a highly highly customized one client a time deep data integration work.
It's not really our bag GlobalBay Merchant which by the way we are going to wind up rebranding GlobalBay Merchant is really for the SMB space.
It is a massively scalable tablet-based for our electronic point-of-sale system and that we will continue to build out.
Thank you Dan.
Thank you.
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.
Please proceed.
Thanks.
Good morning guys.
So obviously tremendous amount of progress here on multiple fronts over the past year or so.
As you guys start to look forward to bit more is there a point that you think it makes sense to be in a position to provide some longer-term financial targets to investors beyond the fiscal 2015 guidance that we will obviously get next quarter but just as people try and think about where your normalized earnings power could shake out beyond fiscal 2015? Is that something that's on your road map to provide something like that at some point in time? Thank you Jason.
This is Marc.
Certainly for the Q4 earnings call in December we will provide the 2015 guidance and some color of course on Q1 and I think you make some really good observations about beyond a lot of the areas particularly in media that we spoke about today petrol our new relationship with Gilbarco a lot of the opportunities associated with that platform commerce enablement come in very late 2015.
So what I would suggest without us committing because we are in the planning stages of 2015 we will likely give some color as we project out.
But for now the plan is to provide 2015 guidance in particular in Q4.
Okay and then as we think about market share recovery globally and certainly in places like Brazil it's been quite significant.
But what inning if you will are we in with regard to this global market share recovery process? And which geographies do you still think offer the most significant opportunities for VeriFone to regain share over the next 12 to 24 months? Yes.
Thanks for that question.
I think we certainly are off the lows with referring with certification and you know just really being unavailable for clients who want to do business with us.
I think we have made some good improvements.
As I said I don't think that we are where we need to be in China.
It is an enormously important market and we are really not a factor given the fact that our competitors there have been going out at it for a long time and they are doing a great job.
So you will see us focused heavily on fixing our China product problem.
That's one way that I hope to be able to win back some of our market share.
There are other places where I think that can also be a factor.
I think you have talked about France in the past.
Obviously we just didn't have a product.
We didn't have significant product in the U.K.
We didn't have a product in some other parts of the world.
So any place where there is an obvious hole that's where we started and that's where we are working hard to be able to deliver our solutions and you know for us it's the root cause.
It has been obsession.
How could we have ever allowed this thing to get this way.
So a lot of it is maybe not tactical one country at a time it's really strategic.
How do we never make this mistake again.
Understood.
Thank you.
Thank you Jason.
Your next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley.
Please proceed.
Yes.
Hi there.
Maybe just following up on that previous question on China you guys talked about introducing a pilot device in Q4.
Can you just walk through the process of what happens after the pilot is introduced? How long will it take for you guys to gather feedback? And maybe after that how long to introduce a full feature product afterwards? Well thanks for that Smitti.
This is Paul.
So on the China question you know it is a little bit more complicated than you typically would approach the problem because in our case we certainly can produce a new product.
No problem.
But that's not how you win in China.
I think in the case of China we really needed to have every element of that product be designed and built for the Chinese market right.
So it was not something we design in California and then put through our typical supply chain process.
We kind of took a we want to build a good China business in China.
They are a very different place from the rest of the world.
So we kind of approached it that way.
So the product we are rolling out is really a homegrown China product from our China team using China standards and processes.
We got hit pretty hard in China for not being nimble meaning that they wanted us to be able to turn things around faster and get things certified faster for their market.
So we took a completely grassroots approach.
And so the pilot is about not only putting the device in the hands of clients who have been asking for a lower priced one it is that the entire ecosystem around that device is going to be very China centric.
And so we are going to iterate very fast and focus really hard on getting this right because out of that will come the full line of lower cost China products not just the C520 that we described but every terminal type countertop as well as wireless as well as the terminal that is used for mPOS the whole line of products and so that's really what we are trying to achieve is good feedback from clients that say you know you guys have now got it right.
So bring us the rest.
Got it and then maybe just a follow-up on some of the new technology initiatives that you talked about earlier Bluetooth low energy iBeacons and others.
Assuming that one of these technologies do take off how long will it take you guys to incorporate it into your next-generation of terminals? And how long will the certification process take? Well to answer that too long.
That's part of the rub we now have which is when you started with 13 operating systems and you have every flavor of SKU the exact issue is that the world is going to accelerate in the coming decades with regard to payments and commerce technology and we up to now have been completely flat-footed on being able to be nimble on that.
So what we have been doing through our transformation is we are reducing operating systems reducing SKUs building our product roadmaps across terminal solutions payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement with the absolute ironfisted commitment to prepare our devices for the future which means being able to upgrade them much much faster.
I don't know if NFC is the answer or low-energy Bluetooth is the answer or a smoke signal.
Nobody knows.
But we need to be able to very quickly take whatever the solution that is in the brick-and-mortar environment of our merchant clients and the integrators and the acquirers and service them then we need to be able to upgrade them much more quickly with a much faster path to certification which is why I keep saying that payment-as-a-service is such a critical element of our business right.
If we get the architecture right if we get down to a single operating system if we get down to a family of products then payment-as-a-services also around being able to very quickly take all these devices out there and upgrade them.
And that's really what we are preparing for.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you Smitti.
And your last question for today comes from the line of S.K.
Prasad Borra from Goldman Sachs.
Please proceed.
Hi Paul.
Hi Marc.
A couple from my end.
Can you please confirm that the growth uptick you are seeing in U.S.
is sustainable going forward? And is it broad-based wins across product lines and a case of gaining market share or just benefits from the petrol business? And secondly how much of a revenue opportunity do encryption and tokenization represent for you? And on the model you choose for it is it going to be some sort of a partnership with the networks or the acquirers? Or do think you would be in a position to monetize it in a standalone manner? Hi S.K.
Prasad.
This is Marc.
Let me take the first part of that question.
With respect to the momentum in North America it's across the board and we have seen it again in Q3 particularly with the sequential improvements in SMB and petrol but really with some of the pent-up demand in Tier 1 retail where our new product our MX 900 series saw some nice uptick there.
And I believe that the momentum is going to continue.
I wouldn't talk much about taxi in particular but taxi vertical has been pretty strong particularly on the transaction size we have seen the softness as we call that on the non-digital advertising piece but I think the momentum in North America in particular will continue certainly into next year.
Yes and just take the second part of your question.
We look at encryption as mission-critical table stakes.
There is not a client in the world that we have talked to who is not significantly worried about cyber crimes and you just need to pick up the newspaper.
So for us it is the first thing that we look at because we are a client first company.
It is what do to provide end-to-end encryption for our merchants as efficiently as quickly as possible.
I think we were rather inflexible historically about the way we looked at encryption.
It's our way or the highway.
We have completely smashed that as an operating principle.
I don't think its client first.
So for us if a client wants to use our end-to-end encryption on our terminals that's great.
We are happy to get back up and running.
If they have other encryption services or other opportunities we are certainly not going to stand in their way.
We will do whatever we need to to make our merchants and the acquirers serve them be able to get encryption into the market as fast as possible.
In terms of monetization I don't view it so much as individual tactical monetization opportunities.
I view it as we want to be able to manage our clients' point-of-sale environment in a way that reduces their risk.
And encryption is one element of it but there are many others.
I would much prefer to be able to have a conversation with the merchant and say look you could either manage this environment yourself buy the terminals and go at it or you can really evaluate a model where VeriFone manages that environment on your behalf and we will provide you with not only the best encryption and tokenization solutions in the market but we will also monitor each one of your terminals through VHQ which is our monitoring solution and we will always keep you at the cutting-edge with regards to things like NFC or Bluetooth or whatever else you have.
I think that's a much better way to monetize than to say to somebody hey it's going to cost you X dollars to encrypt.
I think that encryption is completely mandatory in my view.
If you are a merchant and you have got terminals encrypt them right away.
And that's really been our mantra and whether we do it or somebody else does it it doesn't matter.
You just need to get it done.
That's very helpful.
Thank you.
Thank you S.K.
Prasad.
Well look folks I want to thank everybody for this session.
We view these calls as really a way to communicate and to better explain what we are up to.
We value very much your feedback.
We value these questions.
It really is incorporated into how we run the place.
And so with that I will just like to say thank you and we look forward to talking to you again in December.
Thank you very much.
This concludes today's conference.
Thank you for your participation.
You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Thank you Doug.
And thank you all for joining us today.
I'm really inspired by our team's accomplishments midway through our transformation program.
We've really come a long way.
Over the past 12 months we've restored organic growth to our top line.
We increased annual revenues by 9% and improved our year-over-year profitability versus fiscal year 2013.
We're earning back the trust of our clients and recapturing market share.
We made significant progress fixing our foundation by executing our top three VeriFone initiatives product portfolio management R&amp;D reengineering and cost optimization.
We transformed our people platform attracting the world class talent we need to execute our transformation and the next chapter of our strategy.
And we've made important progress changing VeriFone into a global product company.
Our three global product lines are now delivering far more competitive payment terminals productizing and geographically expanding our payment-as-a-service offerings and are commercializing commerce enablement solutions across our platform.
There is tremendous enthusiasm tremendous energy and pride across the VeriFone franchise today.
What a difference a year makes.
What I'd like to do today is walk you through what we've accomplished in Q4 summarize 2014 and discuss our focus areas for 2015.
Overall our performance in Q4 was strong certainly a good way to end the year.
We grew our business sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Year-over-year we grew our top line in Q4 by 13%.
We increased our operating profit margins to 13.9% an improvement of more than 300 basis points over the prior year.
And we continued to improve our balance sheet metrics and generated a healthy cash flow.
We also saw solid results across our regional client franchises.
In North America our business grew by 20% year-over-year a record quarter as we gained strength and market share.
Latin America grew by nearly 16% over last year as we continued to improve our position.
And in October we were awarded a significant win in Mexico to become the preferred wireless terminal platform for BBVA the country's largest bank.
EMEA grew 5% despite strong foreign exchange headwinds as we continued to improve our competitive position in Europe and regain share.
And in our developing markets we saw strong growth in Turkey as well as Nigeria where we benefited from the country's expansion of government-sponsored initiatives to drive cashless payments.
And finally we saw substantial growth in Asia during all of FY 2014 and finished the year up 24% year-over-year in Q4.
Much of the success in our regional client franchises is attributed to the strong execution of our transformation program as well as the benefit of accelerating macro trends driving paper to digital payments and the overall strengthening of security.
A year ago on my first earnings call I shared with you our two year transformation program.
This program is focused on fixing our foundation through our top three VeriFone initiatives.
Today I'd like to give you an execution progress report at the halfway point.
I'm going to begin with product portfolio management.
One year ago VeriFone was actively offering our clients more than 1 200 product SKUs.
We were also perpetuating a unreasonably high degree of redundant one-off customizations across the regions.
This resulted in fragmentation it resulted in complexity slow deployments and of course escalating costs in engineering and supply chain and it significantly limited our ability to scale innovation and deliver organic growth.
To address this the team implemented a global product management discipline for all new and existing products.
We reviewed every terminal SKU and customization request to make sure that they fit our strategy and indeed required unique resources.
The impact at the halfway point of our product portfolio management initiative is significant.
We reduced product SKUs by nearly 60% to approximately 500 with minimal impact to our clients.
We reduced our number of active terminal platforms from 13 at the beginning to 8 as of today.
We addressed our portfolio gaps that existed in certain markets including Canada Brazil France and China where we now offer additional certified products in all of these countries.
Through the product portfolio management process we also identified three non-core business lines that we divested during 2014.
These consist of the GlobalBay enterprise retail software business the ChargeSmart online bill payment portal and the sferragon [ph] consulting services business in France.
Our second initiative is R&amp;D reengineering.
As a result of our acquisitions and fragmented product portfolio VeriFone's engineers were spending too much time maintaining legacy products and supporting our 13 operating platforms.
We knew that we needed to reduce complexity eliminate overlap and improve cycle times in order to better compete and serve our clients.
As part of R&amp;D reengineering we evaluated every element of our organization including doing a deep dive into our 1 800 person R&amp;D team our technology architecture our services effectiveness and our productivity.
We developed a consolidation plan to move our engineers from 75 sites into 34 including 10 global centers of excellence for hardware and software development.
As of today we are now approximately 25% of the way toward our goal and expect to complete the transition by the end of 2015.
There are numerous additional examples of how we are improving R&amp;D.
We're implementing a common architecture in our software applications enabling us to unify our development environment.
We're standardizing and consolidating our gateways and we implemented a resource and project planning tool in order to better manage R&amp;D.
Our third initiative is cost optimization.
We knew that we needed to drive efficiency in order to self fund the execution of our transformation and our next chapter strategy.
To this end we initiated more than 100 cost savings projects including the difficult decision to reduce our headcount.
We started 2014 with 5 800 employees and set a target to reduce that by 500 positions by the end of this calendar year.
Well we were able to achieve this goal ahead of our schedule.
Today we're delivering higher revenues and better client satisfaction with fewer than 5 300 employees.
Marc will give you some more detail and color on our overall margin improvement progress in his section.
More importantly as part of this headcount evaluation and reduction process we also identified and upgraded our talent in 650 key additional positions across the globe.
We established a VeriFone management committee and hired more than a dozen extraordinarily accomplished senior people to this group to lead our businesses and our functions.
We filled key roles at all levels of the organization including creating a global relationship management function for our top clients and we helped to bring in three terrific new board members to help guide us to live up to our potential and ensure we could become the Company that we want to be.
And we've done so much more to further streamline our business and reduce our expenses.
We will consolidate 20% of our data centers by the end of 2015.
We performed an extensive review of our supply chain effectiveness and efficiency and are building deeper and more strategic supplier relationships with our key partners.
As a result we have already reduced our total number of suppliers by 23% year-to-date.
We closed 19 of our 130 facilities exceeding our target of 10 for the calendar year.
We liquidated 16 legal entities reducing that number from 132 to 116.
We began to execute a shared services model for all of our back office functions.
We also began the rollout of salesforce.com and we refinanced our debt with a $1.3 billion credit agreement providing several economic and structural enhancements including a significant reduction in interest expense.
As you can see during the first year of executing our top three VeriFone initiatives we delivered important results.
Our entire global organization is committed to driving this execution to completion by the end of 2015.
More than 200 of our top leaders are measured against a broad score card with specific targets for their role in this very process.
Together these leaders and their teams are making VeriFone a more focused a more nimble and effective company certainly more than we've ever been before.
I'm proud of them.
The effort that they bring to VeriFone every day and the success that they've achieved this year.
But as I said we're only halfway done.
We will continue to update you on a regular basis as we complete the execution of our top three VeriFone initiatives.
Now VeriFone's transformation extends well beyond our top three initiatives.
2015 is the year of product at VeriFone.
We are leveraging the improvements made through our transformation to deliver more innovative solutions for our clients certainly more than we've ever done in our history.
Of course VeriFone's terminal solution business is integral to this year of product.
As you know payment terminals are increasingly converging with powerful consumer connected devices.
That's why we're particularly excited to announce that Glen Robson the Chief Technology Officer of Dell and General Manager of their Specialty products group is joining VeriFone to lead our global terminal solutions business.
Glen has a 20 year track record of innovation and building profitable technology businesses at world class global organizations.
And he brings to VeriFone years of expertise in developing and delivering innovative devices that leverage Android Windows and other operating systems.
We're thrilled to add Glen and the experience and energy he brings to VeriFone's leadership team.
Under Glen the terminal solutions business will continue to be hard at work architecting the next generation of the payment terminal.
In late FY 2015 VeriFone will launch our highly anticipated entirely new terminal platform that moves the industry well beyond one dimensional purpose-built devices.
Our new terminals are more powerful.
They're commerce enabled and feature-rich network end points that help converge the online and offline shopping experience and help merchants attract customers and sell more products and services.
I've been working closely with our industrial design team and have used these new terminals and they're seriously exciting.
No one has ever released anything like this.
These terminals will run our flagship Linux based operating system and leverage a common API allowing clients and partners to create certified applications that are portable across this entire portfolio.
This combination of new hardware operating system and application architecture will become the standard for every new VeriFone product category by the beginning of FY 2016.
In keeping with our client first guiding principle we will continue to sell and support our existing products and develop solutions using our current technologies allowing our clients to migrate to our new platform at their own pace.
We're also launching a new generation of mPOS terminals that work with a wide range of consumer tablets and smartphones and run VeriFone and third party software.
Momentum is growing for merchants to deploy both fixed and mobile points of sale inside the store.
In fact recent data from McKinsey indicates that interest in such capabilities from small and mid-sized multilane merchants grew by 25% in just over the last year alone.
VeriFone's new sleeves and mPOS terminals are flexible modular and capable of addressing the many use cases mobile will enable for merchants of all sizes.
Beyond this in 2015 you will see the launch of several other new VeriFone terminal solutions.
We're expanding our terminal ECR product line which allows merchants in developing countries such as Turkey and many other countries that are moving in this direction to comply with progressive local tax regulations.
We're expanding our portfolio in China and building the best value price terminal solutions for that market.
We're launching the next evolution of our premier MX 900 series multilane retail terminals bringing the latest in security and further expanding our market leading position beyond the United States.
We're enhancing our entry level PIN pad products and we will also deliver an enhanced product portfolio for France.
As you can see our terminal solutions team is certainly hard at work this year.
But the year of product will also be a big year for our payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement businesses.
You'll recall that VeriFone began to scale its payment-as-a-service business with the acquisitions of the Nordics based company Point in 2012.
At the time Point operated in 11 countries mostly throughout Northern Europe serving a captive network of nearly 0.5 million merchants to whom they provided a subscription based multi-channel payment service offering that included terminals field services transaction routing encryption estate management as well as E&amp;M commerce all delivered through a secure gateway connection.
This business continues to attract a growing number of retailers and acquirers in search of a lower cost of ownership a reduced compliance burden and increased visibility into their business performance.
For example SPAR one of UK's largest convenience supermarket chains with approximately 1 200 stores operating in 30 countries outsources its point of sale operations to VeriFone.
Using our payment-as-a-service platform we administer their fleet of EMV terminals.
We reduce their PCI scope enable customer recognition and loyalty programs.
We monitor their transactions in real time and provide them with all the necessary field services to support this.
And VeriFone provides all of this through an all in one pricing model providing SPAR and thousands of other merchants with a predictable and value based pricing model.
Today under the leadership of Vincent Roland who I introduced to you last quarter our payment-as-a-service business is a key part of VeriFone's strategy to help our clients and also to connect our terminals as network end points.
VeriFone today is one of the world's largest payment service providers.
Our gateways today route more than 10 million transactions a day and that's a 27% year-over-year growth from this time last year.
We expect this growth to continue next year as well.
And we're growing the payment-as-a-service business geographically including expansion of our business in the United States Australia and New Zealand and expanding into new markets such as Turkey.
Recently we have added some of the world's best known retail brands as VeriFone payment-as-a-service clients.
Companies including The Limited PUMA The Body Shop Galleries Lafayette Turkish Airlines and The S Group.
In FY 2015 we will continue to invest to further productize and drive global expansion of this business.
We will consolidate and enhance our payment-as-a-service infrastructure.
We will expand the functionality of our offerings.
We will accelerate the convergence of our e-commerce mobile and brick and mortar payment solutions in order to simplify and improve the consumer omni-channel shopping experience.
In addition to our core payment-as-a-service solutions we're driving further VeriFone terminal connectivity in other ways to increase the scale power and capabilities of our platform.
First we're continuing to invest in our global offering for terminal estate management solutions which allow clients to remotely manage their fleet of point of sale terminals.
Using VeriFone's technology merchants and acquirers can keep track of all their devices remotely conduct diagnostics and deliver applications and software updates as well as push media content directly to any device anywhere in the world from a central location.
And the second way we are growing our number of connected terminals is through our secure commerce architecture or SCA.
SCA is a payment architecture that allows merchants to benefit from an integrated point of sale environment without payment data being sent to the PC-based point of sale register.
Through SCA merchants significantly reduce their exposure to large scale payment data breaches and further reduce the complexity and time it takes to certify EMV terminals.
Let me give you a quick example of how one of our retail clients is benefiting from SCA today.
Microsoft retail is using VeriFone's secure commerce architecture in its stores to remove consumer payment credentials from its point of sale register systems.
This allows them to better protect their customer payment data without any loss of functionality in their retail environment.
Microsoft has also gone even further and is leveraging our estate management our encryption and our gateway services along with VeriFone's MX 900 series devices at the counter and our PAYware mobile solution integrated with a Windows-based smartphone to engage customers throughout their stores.
We are seeing significant momentum for this solution.
In Q4 we signed 10 new agreements with major US retailers to connect more than 20 000 additional devices using SCA and the pipeline of demand among top retailers is substantial and growing.
But SCA is not just for merchants.
It's an important catalyst for our acquirers and our value-added reseller partners to rapidly implement EMV for their clients.
In fact I am pleased to announce today that First Data the world's largest acquirer has signed on to deliver SCA for new deployments of VeriFone devices to its US clients.
Turning to commerce enablement this newly established business is tasked with repositioning VeriFone to become a global platform company by leveraging our assets in terminal solutions and payment-as-a-service.
The team is doing this by operationalizing our network of connected terminals and digital media screens and outfitting these things with beacons and other technologies to deliver value-added services including by the way those created by third party developers.
These services include non-payment solutions such as targeted and card-linked offers loyalty programs instant rewards redemption and many other valuable services that our clients are seeking.
We all recognize that many innovations may well never scale but some VeriFone and third party solutions definitely will and our commerce enablement platform will scale them securely across the globe to help our clients and brands attract new consumers and sell more of their products and services.
Furthermore our platform is already trusted by clients and is in the critical path for approximately half of the world's daily consumer card payment volumes.
In 2014 we developed a strategy for this business.
We put in place the means to scale this infrastructure and created proof points demonstrating how VeriFone's commerce enablement platform helps clients increase their revenues.
To commercialize and scale our platform we've been aggressively growing our estate of connected terminals and digital media screens.
Earlier this year we entered into a significant strategic partnership with Gilbarco Veeder-Root the world's leader in fuel dispenser technology and won important mandates from Sunoco Tesoro and Citgo.
Collectively this greatly expands our footprint of connected terminals and digital media screens at gas pumps and convenience stores.
We expect beginning in 2016 and continuing for the next five years after that that we will upgrade more than 400 000 payment devices at the pump.
By the same token we greatly increased our forward inventory of digital media screens in taxis by signing large fleet deals in New York City in Istanbul and in Mexico in fiscal year 2014.
Our growing commerce enablement platform has already delivered some powerful consumer experiences.
A few quarters ago I shared with you our success enabling American Express membership rewards points as a form of real-time currency inside New York City taxis.
Well last month during the Money 20/20 conference we partnered with MasterCard to deliver card-linked offers in Las Vegas cabs.
We delivered offers from local merchants where with a swipe messengers – passengers seamlessly linked offers on our taxi screens to the specific card that they used to pay for their ride.
To redeem the offer consumers paid with the same card at the participating merchant.
And this is yet another demonstration of how our commerce enablement platform provides a great consumer experience increases merchant sales delivers a clear and measurable ROI and greatly differentiates VeriFone versus traditional terminal manufacturers.
In FY 2015 we will further invest to build out our global commerce enablement platform.
Some examples of milestones on our roadmap include growing our media product where we will further expand our platform for advertising and real-time offer delivery.
We expect to significantly grow the size of our network of 48 000 connected digital media screens in FY 2015.
Expanding our position in value-added services by launching digital coupons offers loyalty card linked offers and more leveraging both VeriFone and third party solutions.
We will also deploy beaconized terminals and other to help our clients create consumer experiences in physical brick and mortar stores that rival those that they enjoy online.
We will enable developers to create certified applications and deliver them through our VeriFone marketplace to our global network of connected terminals and screens.
And we will advance VeriFone's cloud point of sale offering by deploying market leading business applications for merchants that work across consumer tablets smartphones and our next generation of terminals.
As I speak to you today I have never been more certain than the push towards a commerce agenda in VeriFone is not only the right direction but it's really an imperative for our company.
Few competitors in the ecosystem have our assets or brand entitlement in physical retail to help merchants build their businesses.
In our year of product you will see increased momentum in commerce enablement.
Let me wrap up here by saying that the transformation work executed this year has made VeriFone a leaner more focused company.
We're winning business in the market with our clients.
We're executing on our growth plan and positioning VeriFone for the year of product.
I will now turn the call over to our CFO and my partner Marc Rothman.
Great.
Thank you Paul.
And now let me make a few comments on our financials.
Consistent with the company's past practice we will be referring to certain financial statement information on a non-GAAP basis.
For our fourth fiscal quarter we are pleased with our strong results and the continued progress on our key financial metrics once again.
We reported net revenues of $491 million exceeding our guidance of $478 million to $483 million.
Our revenues were up 13% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially.
Additionally organic constant currency revenue was up 15% over the prior year.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.44 also exceeding our guidance of $0.39 to $0.40 per share.
This compares to non-GAAP earnings per share last quarter of $0.40 and $0.27 a year ago.
Let me now discuss our results by region.
In North America our revenues were a record $149 million up 15% sequentially and 20% year-over-year.
Our Q4 revenue improvements reflect several factors.
First in our US petro business revenues were up 19% sequentially from last quarter as our next generation in-store POS and site controller offerings gained momentum.
Our new technology is being deployed by many of the industry leaders including BP ExxonMobil and Tesoro.
In our North American taxi business net revenues rebounded this quarter growing 12% sequentially.
This growth was driven by the expansion of our network of taxis and increased digital taxi media revenues and also an increase in our traditional advertising business.
Our small and medium business in the US delivered 12% sequential improvement and showed growth for the third quarter in a row as we benefited from an increased number of certified products in the marketplace momentum from the Apple Pay announcement and increased demand related to the upcoming EMV liability shift.
In Canada we now have a more competitive portfolio in the field and have begun to expand into new areas of the market.
One example is we recently certified one of our new generation of wireless product devices with Global Payments one of Canada's largest processors creating an opportunity to gain share.
Finally strength in our US multilane retail business continues where we delivered 12% growth sequentially driven by demand for our EMV capable MX 900 series products in Tier 1 retail.
We have extended our lead as the platform of choice at the point of sale.
We continue to gain market share with 33 deal wins in Q4 including 8 competitive takeaways and only one deal lost to incumbent.
The US integrated POS terminal market is being driven by several significant catalysts including an accelerating replacement rate a growing focus on EMV security compliance and our merchants' desire for greater capabilities.
We certainly see this reflected in our US results and tied to the upcoming EMV liability shift.
And we expect to benefit from EMV driven upgrades for the foreseeable future.
Turning to Latin America revenues for the fourth quarter were $82 million up 16% year-over-year but down 8% sequentially.
I mentioned last quarter that our business with our major Brazilian clients was particularly strong.
While this business remains strong our sales were down sequentially in Brazil due to customer spending levels during the quarter.
Additionally our business in Mexico remains strong across our banking clients and we continued to see momentum with our recent award from BBVA that Paul referenced earlier.
In Europe Middle East and Africa revenues of $189 million were comparable sequentially and up a 5% year-over-year despite FX headwinds.
Revenues increased in the UK Spain France and Italy year-over-year.
Finally in Asia Q4 revenues of $70 million were up 4% sequentially and up 24% from the prior year.
We saw double-digit year-over-year growth in China and we achieved significant growth in both Australia and New Zealand.
Now let's discuss results by our product lines.
Revenues for our system solutions business were $311 million in Q4 up 20% year-on-year and up 4% sequentially.
Service revenues were a record $180 million in Q4 and that was up 4% year-over-year and 2% on a sequential basis.
As I just mentioned the dollar strengthened during Q4 particularly against several European currencies which resulted in a disproportionate impact on our services business since a significant portion of that business is in Europe.
Importantly though we did grow our services business by 11% for the full year.
Let me turn to our gross margin performance.
Our consolidated gross margin was 42.3% a sequential improvement of 70 basis points from the prior quarter.
The sequential improvement in our system solutions gross margin from 41.3% to 41.5% of revenue reflects favorable supply chain savings.
Services gross margin increased from 42.1% in the third quarter to 43.6% in Q4 primarily as a result of higher taxi transaction and media revenues.
Recall that our advertising business has a relatively fixed cost base so higher revenues in this quarter benefited our gross margin performance.
Our consolidated operating expenses during the quarter were $139 million an increase of $4 million sequentially primarily related to the increase in sales and sales and marketing expenses to reflect the higher investment in our client-facing activities including trade show related investments and our re-branding efforts.
Let me turn to the balance sheet.
On our capital structure we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $250 million.
Our gross debt is now at $883 million and our net debt was reduced to $633 million.
We paid down an additional $41 million of debt during this quarter.
And our net debt to EBITDA ratio as defined in our credit agreement improved to 2.4 times well below the 4.5 times maximum amount allowable under this new agreement.
Let me now discuss some working capital metrics.
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $306 million on higher revenues and as a result of better linearity our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved slightly on a sequential basis to 56 days.
Our inventory balance increased to $124 million and inventory measured as days of inventory increased by 1 day to 38 days.
We will continue to focus on opportunities to improve days of inventory while also ensuring that we're meeting our client product needs in a timely way.
And then in accounts payable we ended the quarter at $161 million an increase of $18 million quarter-over-quarter representing an increase in days payable of 5 days to 51 days.
Overall we are very pleased with our continued progress with our cash conversion cycle which ended the quarter at 43 days a significant reduction of 30 days compared to last year.
As a result of this continued focus on cash management our working capital as a percentage of revenue also improved once again to 13.7% compared to 14.1% last quarter and 17.7% just 12 months ago.
Some highlights now on our cash flow results.
In the fourth quarter of 2014 cash flow from operations was $51 million and our free cash flow is $29 million which includes approximately $5 million related to our restructuring activities.
Our fourth quarter capital expenditures were $22 million including $13 million for revenue generating assets mainly equipment for our payment-as-a-service taxi and media businesses.
And lastly let me turn to our financial guidance.
For the full fiscal year 2015 we are guiding to revenues in the range of $2.02 billion to $2.04 billion.
We expect revenue to increase quarterly on a linear basis throughout the year.
We expect earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.90.
First this guidance reflects continuous improvement in our operating margins both on a competitive and year-over-year basis.
And second we are assuming slightly higher share count reflecting normal dilution.
As we have said by simplifying and executing our transformation we are reducing the margin disparity between ourselves and our largest competitor.
Throughout the second half of 2014 we reduced that gap by approximately 100 basis points and intend to continue to do so throughout 2015 and beyond.
Additionally in the second year of our transformation we will continue to invest above normal run rates as we continue to fix our foundation and invest in new products and services for the long haul.
Also we expect free cash flow generation to be approximately $150 million.
Couple comments on our Q1 guidance.
For Q1 FY 2015 we are guiding non-GAAP revenues in the range of $480 million to $485 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 per share.
This reflects the continued headwind as well created by strength in the US dollar currency.
In addition please refer to slide 20 of our earnings presentation for additional forward-looking financial information.
Thank you.
With that I will ask the operator to open up the line for your questions.
Derek? [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from the line of Andrew Jeffrey SunTrust.
Hi guys.
Thanks for taking the question.
Certainly a lot of exciting initiatives Paul at VeriFone probably more than I've heard at any point in time since the IPO.
Can you talk a little bit about VeriFone's competitive advantage as the market evolves? Obviously we saw a lot – we've seen a lot of new announcements of mPOS solutions and they have a varying degree of EMV certification readiness.
Clearly VeriFone's a leader in that regard.
How do you feel about sort of the timing of the rollout of these newer offerings versus the competition and sort of the positioning as there are numerous new providers coming into the market today? Thanks for the question Andrew.
I appreciate it.
Yes you're certainly correct we have an ambitious program but I think our clients are really in need of these products and whereas we slowed down on organic innovation over the last couple years we really are going to greatly enhance it in 2015.
We've termed it as I mentioned the year of product.
The competitive position that we have in general if we just focus in on the terminal solutions business is that we are today distributing terminals in 150 countries.
We have an installed base of almost 27 million terminals out there.
And we have thousands maybe even millions of client relationships.
And the VeriFone brand stands for security ubiquity and trust.
I think that we've done as much as anyone can reasonably expect to do in a year to solidify that reputation.
We definitely like you see a lot of innovation coming into the space.
The amount of investment going into payments is nothing like I've ever seen in my 25 years in the business.
And there's a lot of excitement.
I happen to love that.
I happen to love when competitors come in and they talk about how they are excited about the space how they want to solve problems and how they're innovating and I think that's terrific.
But there's a big difference between a single product solution that looks cool maybe it's a shiny object maybe it's really great.
But there's a big difference between that and scaling to all those countries and being able to provide world class hardware global distribution payment applications and infrastructure that is certified and scaled globally.
And I think that there's a big difference between where we are as a platform to scale that kind of innovation versus just people that come out with cool new devices.
And as I have spoken to many clients across the globe they too are fascinated by the innovations that they're seeing but they're not about to stand at the genius bar waiting to be helped in the event that their device isn't doing what it's supposed to be.
That's why you need this very large global infrastructure and I think that is a key competitive position.
I love the innovation but I think we're the best platform with which to operational and scale that innovation.
Yes we all tend to be a little US-centric so that's helpful.
And one more p if I may.
Appreciate the color on the US services business.
Marc could you kind of rank order the growth potential that you see in US services if you're thinking about media versus gateway transactions versus perhaps traditional taxi media where do you think we're going to see the most growth in US services over the next couple years? Thanks Andrew.
Let me give you a little color on US services.
So I'd start with petrol.
So you've seen in Q4 we've made significant improvement in our results.
The petrol business carries a significant amount of services revenue maintenance agreements installation deployment related services.
So I would expect with the momentum that we've seen in Q4 and the pent-up demand we had and the new product launches that petrol in the US in particular will continue to be strong.
I'd also say that on the taxi transaction side so as Amos and the team continue to sign up new fleets in New York City and elsewhere around the states I think we'll continue to see transaction revenues flow.
Now we've had our challenges the last 12 months with the traditional advertising business in taxi.
That came back in Q4.
We added more sales resources and we have some more focus I think today much more focus under Vin D’Agostino and that team.
So I'd say traditional hopefully has stabilized but it's definitely lumpy and we're continuing to invest on the digital sides of taxi.
So you'll see more taxi cabs with digital screens interactive screens in both New York and Las Vegas.
So I'd look at petrol and taxi transactions and digital media in particular.
Paul had mentioned secured commerce architecture as well.
We're starting to gain some traction around SCA.
We've signed up a bunch of merchants.
I also could ride on the rails of our payment-as-a-service platform.
So we're real excited about the opportunities in the US marketplace.
Terrific.
Thank you very much.
Thank you Andrew.
Your next question is from the line of Darrin Peller Barclays.
Thanks guys.
Listen I just want to think about your North American business overall just a follow-up quickly.
I mean the growth and the sequential improvement were both notable.
How much of that actually is already coming from EMV upgrades now versus maybe you can qualify how much is coming from the addressable market that EMV might drive in hospitality and other areas.
And then really when we think about the outlook into 2015 if you could give us a little more color on your guidance breaking down how much FX is contributing versus or actually how much of a headwind I should say FX is and then maybe on a regional basis what kind of assumptions we should think about? Thanks Darrin.
It's Paul.
Marc will take the second question.
Let me take the first.
EMV is absolutely a tailwind in the United States.
Let me give you some statistics which might be helpful.
So among Tier 1 the current EMV penetration is about 70%.
By 2015 call it right around the liability shift date you'll see about 90%.
Okay.
There's very little by way of Greenfield opportunity.
The top 200 accounts have been at this for a while.
In the mid-tier right below the Tier 1 call it Tier 2 and 3 you got about a 35% penetration today.
We expect that to be around 55% and again small Greenfield most of these folks already have a terminal.
So it's a function of getting an EMV terminal and turning it on.
Among the SMB space there you've got quite a bit of opportunity right.
You got about 22% penetration today.
We expect that to more or less double by 2015 which is a tall order because the SMB space is an awful lot of merchants.
Call it around 7 million merchants that have 9 million devices.
But within that SMB space there's about a 2 million incremental device opportunity right.
These are people that don't use terminals today and it includes folks like restaurants SMB restaurants small folks.
In hospitality the current penetration is very very low.
We expect that in 2015 you might get about 15% and there's about a million item Greenfield opportunity for restaurants and lodging.
So overall I'd say in the United States you got 35% today that's penetrated for EMV.
By 2015 we will likely see 50% to 55%.
We'll have 3 million new opportunities device opportunities and I should also mention that 90% of devices we shipped in 2014 by the way were EMV right.
So that gives you the lay of the land.
Marc mentioned you've got also the coming up 2017 liability shift date for petrol.
That's also an opportunity for us.
But again overall I would say you got 3 million new devices that are an opportunity.
Clearly not all in 2015 but you should start to see a nice ramp-up starting in 2015.
Thank you Paul.
Darrin let me give you some color on 2015 revenues and I'll make some comments around FX assumptions.
So as I mentioned 2.02 to 2.0 billion range for total revenues.
That's about 8% to 9% growth off of the 2014 results.
And when we look at that by region what I would suggest is that in the Americas I'll combine Latin America and the US for you now for this call we're thinking low double-digit growth in that part of the world.
In Asia actually expect a little bit more momentum between some things that we are doing in China and Australia and New Zealand.
I think we could see revenues in the Asia market in the mid-teens.
Having said that that optimism in both in those regions we're a little bit more guarded with respect to EMEA particularly Western and Northern Europe because of the FX headwinds.
So we're managing and guiding EMEA to low to mid single digit growth rates.
That's how Paul and I are framing the guidance that we provided today and clearly if there is some FX headwinds that are above and beyond what is normal in terms of being forecast then by the market makers we'll have to keep a close eye on that.
Yes.
All right.
I just want to ask… Sure.
Go ahead please.
I was going to ask you about an expense item.
But so if you want to carry forward on what you were saying the revenue side please.
Yes I just wanted to give you a little bit more regional color complement what Paul said about the US market.
So continued momentum of course in EMV and security upgrades and that's at the top with vertical solution Tier 1 retail business as well as SMB.
And again highlighting petrol finally after two years with that business has been really flat because of product refresh cycles PCI 1.3.
Two years ago consolidation of the industry we're starting to see significant rollout of that product and really excited about… Yes… What's happening there and with our partnership with Gilbarco petrol is real exciting.
In Latin America I think continued momentum in Brazil and Mexico and Asia I think we covered and Europe pretty well.
So that's the color I'd give you a little bit one level down as well.
That's great.
Just one last follow-up then I'll turn it back to the queue.
On the expense side you had talked about operating expenses being about 100 basis points better I think as a percentage of revenue.
I know I think you gave preliminary guidance in your slides around OpEx being 560 or 565 million.
Is that still on target in terms of your overall improvement or anything change on that front related to FX perhaps? And again the drivers are is it just continued consolidation of platforms? I mean should we still see margins improve in the right way? Well yes I mean that's the math when we target $565 million OpEx for 2015 it's about 100 basis points reduction like we telegraphed a few quarters back.
Yes… So we think we'll be able to get some good leverage off of the revenue growth.
Of course we'll continue to look at opportunities to regain efficiencies but this year of product is also about making sure that we set ourselves up for very very prosperous future here.
Of course supply chain and other areas around back office infrastructure will continue to take a hard look at.
Now the thing is with the gross margins you'll be able to model into this.
The margins will be relatively comparable to last year.
And the reason we believe that's the case is as much to do with the mix.
So Europe tends to be a greater gross margin profile for us and with the headwinds that will be modest impact.
And then of course the mid-teen growth rates in Asia where it carries a slightly lower margins that will factor into our guidance.
Got it.
All right guys.
Thank you.
Thank you Darrin.
Your next question will be from the line of Phil Stiller Citi.
Hi guys.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Just wanted to follow up on the service revenue growth.
Obviously I think you're seeing some impacts from currency.
But perhaps you could talk a little bit about what your service business is doing in Europe excluding the currency impacts and the outlook for that in 2015? Sure.
Let me take that Phil and thanks for the question.
Our services business just to put FX to the side had a Q4 year-over-year constant currency growth rate of about 4.8%.
Year-over-year we grew that business 11% and it did slow down due to FX headwinds.
Behind the covers what we're doing is we're really harmonizing our variety of different approaches to providing payment-as-a-service.
When we acquired Point what we really acquired was a series of somewhat independently run payment-as-a-service businesses in all the countries.
So Finland was doing something different than Sweden and so forth.
And so we are harmonizing that together.
We are picking the best of what each one of those countries was doing and that is what we are standardizing and trying to scale globally.
We are a bit cautious about FY 2015 growth primarily because the sales cycle for payment-as-a-service is significantly longer than the sales cycle for hardware.
Having said that in our view it's certainly worth the wait.
And what we're trying to do is we're trying to make sure that we have the right product to scale so we're not furthering fragmentation as we go into places like the United States as we go into places like Turkey and others.
And then what we're really excited about is what payment-as-a-service might offer and look like to our merchants and white labeled to acquirers when you add commerce enablement to it.
Because now it's not just operating the fleet of terminals which is very very good thing to do because it's a more secure way to do it it's potentially a lower cost way to do it.
But also because they're going to want the connectivity of those terminals to our call it our app store where we're going to have applications for the merchants that help them to attract new customers and grow sales things like targeted offers things like reward redemption loyalty programs all the stuff we talked about.
But it's a longer sale right.
It doesn't necessarily run through the procurement department that does a reverse auction.
It is a much more consultative sale and its one that although it takes longer I think creates a much much better annuity stream for us and a better solution for clients.
Okay.
Great.
That's helpful.
Switching gears a bit I wanted to ask a question about cash flow.
So the guidance of $150 million I believe for fiscal 2015 it's up nicely from 2014 but obviously seems like there's an embedded increase in CapEx for 2015.
So just wondering what the increased spending is there and then what other assumptions are going into the cash flow guidance around cash conversion cycle? Yes.
Hi Phil.
This is Marc.
Let me take that one.
So the guidance was $150 million.
There is improvement year-on-year but there's also a target to increase capital expenditures to approximately $125 million in 2015.
And the CapEx is really around what we call revenue generating assets payment-as-a-service taxi digital media.
The number of deals that we signed up to in 2014 that allow us to deploy capital and generate revenues and profits going forward particularly I can highlight taxi.
We signed up 18 000 taxis in Istanbul and we're beginning to rollout the Istanbul properties in 2015.
In addition we did a deal with Gilbarco.
We announced that last quarter and as part of that acquisition we not only purchased their Outcast business that will deploy and run systems on but we'll also be rolling out digital media screens on the several petro deals that we signed up to last year as well.
So think about it as capital deployed for business purposes.
Having said that there is some back office investment that we're making.
There is some facility upgrades that we're budgeting for this year as well as some IT infrastructure to enhance and harden the environment.
With respect to a few other metrics we'll continue to have a focus.
This company is definitely got a balance sheet orientation to it.
I don't believe we're going to move the needle on working capital as a percentage of sales much lower than where we are right now.
But I would expect that cash flow conversion to stay roughly in the same range we are at today maybe it will ebb and flow a few days here and there over the next four quarters.
Okay.
Great.
Appreciate it guys.
Thank you Phil.
Your next question will be from the line of Gil Luria Wedbush Securities.
Thanks for taking my question.
On the EMV cycle you mentioned that you see the driver for the foreseeable future.
But you also only guided to 50% 55% penetration by the end of your fiscal 2015 by the deadline.
Does that mean that after that it becomes more of a trend line growth or – and retailers that didn't upgrade by the deadline just choose to go by the regular cycle or will it still be elevated past that as retailers have increasing pressure from Visa MasterCard and their acquirer? Thanks Gil.
It's Paul.
So we do think that there's going to be a good long amount of work to do after the 2015 liability shift date.
And I think that you'll see a lot from SMB and hospitality and as we said restaurants lodging you might see some from the government.
You may recall President Obama's statement that affects the Federal Government locations where they accept cards.
I think there's a fair amount of pent-up demand and of course you have the petrol area as well.
I'm not sure that it's Visa and MasterCard that are going to put any pressure.
I think they'll make the statements as they've always made them.
I think the pressure is going to come candidly from consumers.
And I think consumers will receive their chip cards and they will view that as a way to improve the safety and soundness and protect their identities from being stolen.
And so I think that you might see consumers start to ask places that they frequent why they don't accept chip cards.
But it's not going to be the same pace of adoption that you saw in Tier 1.
I mean those folks really jumped on the bandwagon pretty quick especially since the Target breach.
But these other folks might take a little longer but I think they'll feel the pressure from consumers.
On that as a segue you mentioned I think in your prepared remarks Apple Pay starting to become a driver that maybe that's the carrot for the retailers with the stick being the more of the security issues.
Is that something that you expect to continue as people use Apple Pay more and per your kind of example ask their retailers why they are not accepting it and push them to accept it and would you expect that to expand internationally as Apple Pay expands internationally? Yes I actually do.
So I think I've said this many times.
I certainly believe it.
Payments is an and business not an or business.
Merchants want to accept anything that is in the form of payment for things they sell.
That's why we still have coins 5 000 years later.
And so we do expect that although cash and plastic will be around for many years merchants will have to adopt and make it possible for consumers to use not just Apple Pay but many other types of mobile wallets that are coming into market.
A lot of those wallets bring real value to consumers in a way not just allowing them to leave their wallet at home but more of so because they can deliver real time offers and save people money.
So I see that as a driver.
Today I think maybe 10% to 15% of the US market is really NFC capable and far fewer or much smaller percentage single digits where NFC is actually turned on.
So it's still a relatively small universe.
Curiously 63% of the terminals we ship globally included NFC.
And so you could see that that 10% to 15% is going to – is certainly going to climb.
And then you saw some MasterCard and Visa extend mandated NFC for Europe.
I think new installations need to support NFC after January of 2016.
And then all infield terminals must be support – must support NFC by January of 2020.
So you've got a lot of reasons why NFC and sort of the broadening applicability of terminals is going to keep us busy.
Got it.
Thank you.
Your next question will be from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang JPMorgan.
Hi Great.
Thanks for all the details.
Just first want to ask about the cost savings and the reinvestment that you're making I think probably so you're halfway through the initiatives point [ph] for some numbers to the savings that you've seen or expect in fiscal 2015 and how much you're reinvesting? Sure.
Thanks for the question Tien-Tsin.
This is Marc.
Hi Marc.
So we have called out the restructuring savings would be approximately $35 million annually.
It's actually a bit in excess of that right now so it's a bit over $40 million.
That's our latest rollup.
And for the most part we've been reinvesting it back into the business.
There is a lot of structural things that we've been working on in 2014 and those do go into 2015 and they are around some of the back office things like IT data centers and both the enterprise and the customer facing side.
And then we have a lot of other work to do in terms of shared services.
Paul called out all the work we're doing around upgrading talent and creating a new people platform.
But as importantly or even more importantly it's a reinvestment back into the business to set up an infrastructure around payment-as-a-service to set up an infrastructure around commerce enablement and drive these business into 2015 and beyond requires some reinvestment.
The one area I'd just comment on is research and development.
Alok and the team have a good amount of work to do in terms of consolidation of their sites; consolidating platforms in 2015 we expect to make substantial improvements.
We're about 25% of the way through the site consolidation.
So 2015 to a degree is a bit of a bubble still for us.
We will have to reassess as we end the year and we look at new business opportunities or furthering investments in these categories.
But I would say to some degree this reinvestment of $40 million that we've saved as a result of these restructuring activities or reinvesting into the businesses we'll be taking a hard look going into 2016 and beyond.
The only other thing I'll add is – and Marc hit it exactly right.
As we're very fortunate very very fortunate.
We have a management committee really have the experience and depth of understanding and relationships with our clients that have strong conviction on what needs to be done to take VeriFone and improve it across the board right.
I mean they really get it and they're very passionate about fixing our foundation.
We're equally fortunate because we have a board of directors that understands that these things require us to be quite aggressive in weeding out the inefficiencies and lack of consolidation and rationalization that should have been taking place maybe all along.
And so between having the people that know how to do it and having people that support us not to compromise on getting it done right we're certainly going to use 2015 to continue to fix the foundation and complete the second year of our 2 year transformation.
Right.
So at what point do you think you'll get a better picture of how much of the $40 million in reinvestment you'll be able to recapture? Do you think we'll start to see some of that in 2016 or could it be further out than that just curious? And then I have one more follow-up if you don't mind.
Yes I think we'll get some efficiencies going into 2016 and we'll provide more color on that clearly as we progress the year.
Okay.
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
Just a couple clarification questions and I'll jump off.
Just so petroleum I caught that sounded good.
I know in the past when we've seen gas prices fall that might impact CapEx to some degree.
Can you just comment on that and if there is anything we need to watch there? And then just FX clarification Marc is that a translation comment you're referring to with respect to conservatism in your outlook or is the strong dollar actually impacting your competitiveness with respects to pricing call it just wanted to clarify.
Thanks.
Yes on the last one it's all translation.
I don't think it's a macro issue.
I don't believe it's impacting our competitiveness in any way where we're operating.
And with respect to petrol there's momentum.
It's a fair point relative to oil pricing.
We haven't seen it.
There's a lot of pent-up demand and there's many catalysts that are driving.
I'm pretty bullish on our petrol business in 2015 and it's on the back of not only new product launches but backlog relative to installations that we have rolling out.
Yes I would just add that there's not a lot of money in selling gas the margins on it are pretty small regardless of where the price is.
But there is an awful lot of money to be made in the convenience store attached to it.
So I think our solutions really become more important as the revenue from gas sales falls.
People have more money in their pocket to spend in the convenience store and our technology is really there on commerce enablement to take them from the pump into the convenience store and with things like lift get the sales up.
So look we're seeing interest and we're going to continue to push hard.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you Tien-Tsin.
Your next question will be from the line of Brian King Deutsche Bank.
Hi guys.
Just wanted to clarify.
Most of my questions have been asked but just two clarifications.
I guess first on the FX can you quantify what's in the guidance for FX top and bottom line.
Is it roughly 5 points of headwind? I'm just trying to get an idea on that and then if you can quantify it on the EPS side as well? Let me just deal with some high level if I may.
So as mentioned the annual outlook for us in Europe EMEA but particularly in Western Europe is low single digits.
We have a little bit more momentum in MEA [ph] so we're looking at current rates Brian and rolling them out a little bit of assumption that FX is going to continue to be under pressure dollar will continue to be strong.
So yes it's hurting us probably to the tune of I'd say $25 million year-on-year.
That's the way I'd frame it.
But with respect to the EPS question there is some natural hedge albeit not 100%.
There is a lot of local labor costs that are in those related currencies.
We'll work hard to mitigate the impact but there is some impact on the top line as well as the bottom line.
Okay.
That's helpful.
And then just a clarification on the free cash flow conversion.
If you X out restructuring I think it was north of 100% of net income conversion.
But now it sounds like for 2015 it's going to drop to under 70% conversion.
And I know that was a key focal point of yours coming in.
So it sounds like it's primarily CapEx that's the cause of the lower conversion.
Just want to clarify? Thanks so much.
Yes.
Thanks Brian.
So – and thanks for asking that clarification question on cash flow.
So the CapEx is up.
That is a significant part of the driver.
There is more CapEx than there is depreciation.
There is some restructuring costs call it hangover that we still need to pay out in 2015.
How much is that? Somewhere in the $15 million range.
Okay.
So between those two we'll look to work hard on cash conversion cycle and the rest of the balance sheet to help mitigate.
All right great.
Thanks so much.
Appreciate it.
Your next question will be from the line of Keith Housum Northcoast Research.
Great.
Thanks guys for taking my question.
Question for you guys on the next generation of terminals and as well as the evolution of the 900 series.
Can you provide some color on where you think those two are going to look together? In terms of the new terminal will have a higher price point or its going impress kind of life? How should we look at that going forward? Yes.
So we're very excited about what the terminal solutions team has innovated for our next generation of terminals.
They've been at it for quite some time really trying to build something that will take the company into the next bunch of years here.
And the terminals that they have engineered have significantly increased performance certainly a more responsive experience with the ability to run rich apps.
Consumers will definitely notice the difference no doubt about that.
Those terminals also come with some industry leading security.
Our current terminals are highly secure.
So I don't know if it's as much of an impact in that but it's just a little bit more future proofing the security.
So merchant and consumer data tightly controlled.
You also heard me talk about SCA.
That's a commerce architecture that takes the data out.
A lot of state-of-the-art technology a lot more functionality an open operating system which is really terrific.
Because if you have non-payment stuff that you want to run you can iterate that much more quickly because you don't have to recertify which is really cool.
And they went design happy on this stuff and I'm glad because they took the blinders off and they really focused on making devices that merchants are going to think are sexy and consumers are going to like to interact with right.
That's all good.
I mentioned that we're rolling out new mPOS solutions and those run the gamut of dongles [ph] and sleeves and software all of that has a very different look and feel to it.
And I think that that is – that's all something that our clients expect from a VeriFone right.
One of the things we forgot to do over the last couple of years is put out a product roadmap that delivered something every quarter that was compelling for our salespeople to sink their teeth into and engage with clients.
So we're changing that in the year of product.
In terms of the MX series which is very very successful in the United States we've had an awful lot of clients ask when we're going to bring those terminals outside of the United States.
So the answer is now.
We're starting to bring terminals outside – those MX series terminals outside the United States.
We're also getting them certified for 4.0.
All of that's happening as we speak.
In terms of pricing the pricing is going to be value pricing and it will be what the market will bear.
But we think we're going to get a premium for those devices in the market.
Got you.
If you can he remind me if China your new products when do you guys plan on rolling those out? Yes.
So in China as I think you all know China is a really interesting market.
It was a big reality check for me and for the rest of the company in 2014.
We used to be the leader in China.
We are no longer the leader in China.
In fact we're way at the back of the pack which is very frustrating.
In FY 2015 we expect that market to be about $780 million.
It will be the largest terminal market in the world.
Last year or this year FY 2014 it was about $650 million.
And so we looked at that situation and said totally unacceptable can't see us being a leader without fixing this.
And so first thing we did was we created a dedicated China R&amp;D team empowered those people gave them the tools they needed and we started to launch new products.
And this quarter we rolled out a C520 which is currently in pilot and doing quite well.
We're going to roll out PCI 4.0 version of that product in July.
We'll have a C portable version of that product in September.
And we're going to have a three in one PIN pad likely that we're going to do in partnership with somebody else.
So whereas we were in famine mode in China for a while we're going to be in feast mode going forward.
Great.
Thank you.
Sure.
Your next question will be from the line of John Williams Topeka.
Hi there.
Good evening guys.
Hey John.
Hey John.
So just a quick follow-up on FX.
We get a lot of questions during the quarter from investors just on specifically how you're hedged what share of your expenses are local versus non-local currency.
I just think to get a sense of how you mitigate the impacts of FX so this might be helpful if you could give some color on that?  Okay.
Thanks John.
So couple of things.
One from a derivative perspective we really to date only hedged the balance sheet.
So it's been balance sheet driven with receivables or payables or other balance sheet items we have at a given month or quarter end.
We have a normal hedging program for that.
There's some good information in the regulatory filings.
With respect to projected transactions we tend not to speculate and we don't speculate so we let those transactions roll in the normal course.
We are exposed 70% of the business is outside the US.
But a lot of our product is US dollar based.
We do our procurement in places where we use the US dollar.
As I mentioned with color much of the exposure we have particularly in Northern Europe there is some natural hedges because of local labor content.
I don't have specific John across the region or specific countries on how much exposure.
I mentioned earlier that FX will probably be about a $25 million exposure to us this year at the top line and of course we'll be able to mitigate some of that.
Okay.
You said no specific income statement hedging in the balance sheet?   Not today.
Doug and I always look at the opportunities but to date we haven't been forward-looking hedging.
Okay.
If I could just ask one quick follow-up regarding I guess think about capital allocation it’s always been a very acquisitive industry and there's been rollups over the years and I guess what you could think of as the markets that are growing fastest.
So two questions.
Number one obviously paid down debt.
Comfort level there regarding leverage.
I'd just love to get a sense from you how you feel about where you are now on that.
And the second one is when you look at the business are there strategic apps in particular markets that you need to be filled and when do you get comfortable that timing is right to go ahead and do that? Thanks for answering the questions.
Yes.
John let me take this one.
It's Paul.
We didn't make any acquisitions in FY 2014.
We were very disciplined and focusing on fixing our foundation.
I think that was the right decision for us.
In fact if anything we divested three non-core businesses that we felt were subscale and that really didn't fit our strategy at all.
And so I think that we worked hard to simplify.
We're now on a firmer footing from an operational capital structure and financial wherewithal.
Most importantly we went from having a good team to having a great team.
When you have a great team you have to give them more stuff to do.
Otherwise they get bored.
So what I plan to do is certainly evaluate opportunities to let this team shine.
And if that involves tuck-in acquisitions to enhance our capabilities products and services that our clients value that's fine.
It wasn't the right time in FY 2014 and it's starting to be the right time now.
But I got to tell you.
We are very cautious and disciplined.
These targets really need to fit our strategy not the other way around.
And for me the most important thing is that I can integrate them.
It's not clear that they can be integrated if it's not clear that there's good chemistry among the management team if it's not clear that we can be one VeriFone I won't do them.
And so the bar's high.
Not to mention the fact that candidly if you've seen some of the multiples that are out there they are insane.
And I for one can't make that math work.
I'm all for leveraging.
I just can't levitate stuff.
And a lot of it looks like levitation to me.
Thank you guys.
Appreciate it.
Thank you John.
And at this time we have time for one more question.
That question will be from the line of S.K.
Prasad Goldman Sachs.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Couple if I may.
First on the margin profile for the business.
Obviously you're in an investment mode right now for payment-as-a-service and commerce enablement.
Assuming that these businesses reach scale more on a steady state; will this operating margin sort of be in line with rest of the business? And second on SMB when are you expecting to see an inflection point in EMV adoption?   Thanks S.K.
Let me take the first part and then Paul will take the second question.
2015 we're expecting to improve the margin profile bottom line it's driven by did the OpEx leverage.
Your question was really specific to the new businesses.
To some extent there actually is some scale in both of those business payment-as-a-service we have operations in 11 different countries and they do perform with a very good margin profile.
So we're looking to not only optimize and scale that improve the operating performance but then take that into new markets.
Commerce enablement is mixed.
There's some steady state business with petro and taxi and media.
So I think there's opportunities to improve upon that margin as we scale it further.
But there's a lot more to do in some of the early work that Vin and team are doing.
And the expectation is that yes if they – they will perform at margins that are commensurate with our other businesses.
There's a limited amount of resources to spend so they have to have commensurate returns.
It's obviously early days but certainly those are the expectations.
Yes.
And in terms of SMB while there's I guess a couple things to say about SMB.
One is that as you probably recall we didn't have certified product for US SMB for a period of time or we didn't have as much as we needed.
We have by and large fixed that gap took a lot of heavy lifting but we're there.
And so we're seeing at least in Q4 we saw pretty strong growth given the fact that we increased.
And those SMB clients recognize our brand.
They the see it and they want it and so if we've got the right product and it's certified the acquirers and the distributors that we work with are very happy to distribute and sell it.
I think that's important.
In terms of EMV inflection in SMB that's a slightly different animal.
So here's my understanding of the SMB market.
There is about 7 million merchants in SMB today and that includes hospitality and these are merchants that have brick and mortar stores.
I'm not talking about the folks that put a dongle on their smartphone.
I'm talking about people that have established store fronts.
There is about 7 million merchants in that category about 9 million devices today.
Of what's out there about 22% of them in 2014 had an EMV capable device.
By 2015 about half will have an EMV capable device.
So anything that they're buying today has an EMV chip in it.
In fact again 90% of the devices we ship in 2014 were EMV.
I would imagine that by 2015 we will see an increase in not only ship share but we'll see an increase in the implementation of those devices to now accept the chip card right.
So 2014 66% of what we shipped in the US to SMB had an EMV chip acceptance in it.
By 2015 we would expect 80% of what we ship to SMB will have EMV in it.
And then it's a function of how quickly they turn that on within their environment.
Last thing I'll say about SMB is that it is a really interesting market segment.
They are typically the ones that are super innovative in terms of their desire to try new things.
And so you see many of the – maybe we call them shiny objects today but we learn an awful lot of the implementation of these devices in the SMB market.
These are the dual screen things that have Android in them and can run apps whether it's all the good work that the folks at First Data did with Clover and you've seen some of the more recent devices.
I mean you learn a lot from how users interact with that.
And so it's not exactly EMV per se but it just shows that that is an important market for us to take the lead in.
Thank you.
Very clear.
End of Q&amp;A   So I guess that was our final question and let me just close by thanking everyone.
2014 was to my way of thinking a very good year for VeriFone.
We walk the walk.
And we did what we said.
And looking back I'm really proud of what we've been able to achieve in a very short period of time.
We are by no means done.
We've got a hell of a lot more work to do.
But we are becoming a company that is more client oriented.
We're certainly becoming more operationally excellent a lot more strategy is driving what we do.
We are organizing ourselves properly and we're really starting to execute our next chapter strategy and it's really great to see us uniting under a single distinct culture these are all things that were missing from VeriFone that I feel are there today.
Looking ahead to 2015 I see a VeriFone that is going to continue to execute well and put points on the board.
And that we're going to definitely make the turn from being simply a terminal provider to becoming more of a platform company that helps our clients to grow their businesses.
And we're going to expand and we're going to upgrade our global terminal footprint.
We're going to connect more VeriFone devices to the VeriFone cloud.
And we're going to deliver to our clients the services that they need.
Most importantly the team here is really just getting started and the best is yet to come.
So with that I'd like to thank everybody and wish you all a happy holiday.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Q1 2015 VeriFone Systems Inc.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Paul Galant CEO of VeriFone.
Thank you Doug and thank you all for joining us today.
I'm pleased with our business performance in Q1.
The VeriFone team is delivering for our clients while executing a comprehensive transformation.
Our core client business outperformed all of the targets that we set for Q1 FY 2015 enabling us to again exceed our financial guidance despite Q1's foreign exchange and macroeconomic related headwinds.
As you know these headwinds have further strengthened since we last provided guidance in December.
And Marc will update you shortly on how we calculate the incremental impact and adjustment to our guidance for the rest of FY 2015.
And while we are working to mitigate the impact we are not compromising our mission to transform VeriFone and capture the market opportunities that we see ahead of us.
Overall our performance in the quarter was strong across the board.
We grew the top line by 11% over Q1 of FY 2014 and again improved our year-over-year profitability in the quarter.
We further increased our operating profit margins to 14.4% an improvement of 50 basis points since last quarter and more than 200 basis points versus this prior year.
This improvement comes despite consistent investment spend to fund our transformation and accelerate the delivery of new products.
We achieved record revenues in North America driven by market share gains and continued momentum in EMV especially as VeriFone's growing list of clients such as Starbucks begin to implement consumer-facing payment terminals in the United States to the first time.
We remain focused in the quarter on our working capital metrics improving our free cash flow year-over-year and further deleveraging our balance sheet.
We continue to make progress in year two of our transformation.
We're fixing our foundation delivering more consistently for our clients and reinvesting our efficiency savings to execute our next chapter of growth strategy.
We have hallmarked 2015 as the Year of Product at VeriFone.
In Q1 we made progress on our next-generation terminals planned for launch later this year and we launched several important new products and services in key areas such as mobility.
Looking back on our accomplishments in Q1 we've made tangible progress and are better positioned to grow our client business in 2015 and beyond.
Although we are not yet executing at the level we want our clients tell us that we are delivering better products and services and are significantly ahead of where we were a year ago.
We plan to continue this trend.
Today I will update you on progress we have made in the quarter on our transformation initiatives as well as on our 2015 Year of Product announcements and launches in our Terminal Solutions our Payment-as-a-Service and our Commerce Enablement businesses.
Let me begin with an update on our transformation initiatives.
As you know in year one we reengineered many business processes and generated meaningful run rate savings which we're consistently reinvesting to upgrade our infrastructure acquire new talent and build our global product businesses.
In year two we are more externally focused with this work and are executing initiatives in transformation that are directly impactful to our clients.
Starting with product portfolio management we are driving a global product management discipline to focus our product lines improve our delivery times enhance our software and accelerate our pace of innovation.
Last year we eliminated nearly 60% of our product SKUs.
In FY 2015 we're going to continue to focus our product portfolio on fewer more impactful products that delight our clients and provide VeriFone with a good return on investment.
To this end a top priority this year is to further consolidate our active terminal platforms as we transitioned to our next-generation terminal architecture.
We began FY 2014 with 13 platforms and we finished the year with 8 platforms.
We expect to consolidate one additional platform by the end of FY 2015.
In parallel the first device is based on our next-generation terminal platform will launch by the end of the fourth quarter and the majority of our products including our desktop our portable multi-lane and PIN pad devices will run on this new platform in the coming years enabling us to further reduce the number of platforms we operate.
Now the impact of this transition cannot be overstated.
A year ago our engineers were having to work and maintain 13 disparate operating platforms.
As we continue to move toward a common architecture more of our resources will be focused on making the next-generation of VeriFone terminals truly distinct.
And the migration to a common hardware and software platform drives meaningful scalability and cost efficiency which will really help to address the margin gap between us and our competitors.
In our second transformation initiative which we called R&amp;D reengineering we continue to simplify our operations to apply more resources to our clients' most pressing needs and to our highest priority growth areas.
This begins with driving a more disciplined execution process to better hit client commitment dates and improve software.
Over the past year we've improved our processes and allocated more of our engineering resources to build our next-generation of products.
Overall I could tell you that we're becoming significantly more data-driven and far more disciplined in how we run R&amp;D.
This quarter we made further progress towards our goal of consolidating our R&amp;D footprint from 75 facilities to 34 facilities globally with 10 major centers of excellence.
This consolidation delivers increased efficiency improved collaboration and drives a far greater yield of innovation from our product people and our engineers.
We're implementing a common architecture for the development of our software applications globally which standardizes and dramatically improves the timelines and quality of our solutions.
Today only 5% of our applications leverage our new architecture which means that it takes too many VeriFone engineers and too much time to develop to test and deliver applications to our clients.
By the end of 2015 90% of our application work will leverage our new architecture which will deliver meaningful improvement in efficiency and time-to-market.
Also in the first quarter we made progress standardizing our 12 gateways to a single global architecture to provide clients with a single entry point interface into our Payment-as-a-Service and omni-channel offerings.
Doing so will also allow us to scale our commerce enablement products more quickly across the globe.
We've already gone live with this new gateway architecture in the United States and expect to standardize three additional gateway installations through 2015.
Our third transformation initiative is cost optimization where we are driving common global processes to generate savings to help improve margins and fund the execution of our transformation in our next chapter strategy.
As you recall in FY 2014 we reduced our head count from 5 800 employees to 5 300 employees and upgraded approximately 650 positions to support our growth.
In 2015 we continue to drive additional head count efficiency and upgrade talent to improve our execution.
And we are driving a greater culture of accountability at VeriFone by expanding performance scorecards from 200 employees in 2014 to nearly every VeriFone employee by the end of this year.
Also we're making substantial improvements to reduce costs in our supply chain area by consolidating our distribution our repair and our warehouse operations.
Additionally we're driving ongoing supplier consolidation and achieving greater buying leverage through the simplification of our product portfolio.
These supply chain activities generated really good savings in Q1 and we expect similar results throughout the remainder of the year.
We're consolidating an additional 20% of our data centers by the end of 2015 further improving our operations in this critical infrastructure.
As you know we've already achieved significant savings rationalizing our real estate footprint as we closed 19 facilities of our 130 facilities last year.
In 2015 we're going to close an additional 11 facilities down to 100 facilities by the end of the year.
Last year we liquidated 16 legal entities out of our 132 legal entities and we're going to liquidate another 13 entities this year.
And finally we began implementing a shared services model for our back office functions last year.
As of Q1 our shared service center covers 28% of our legal entities at VeriFone.
We will reach approximately 60% by the end of this year.
All in all we are proud of what we're able to achieve in year one of our transformation as well as our continued progress in the first quarter of year two.
We're making VeriFone leaner more nimble and far more focused.
And we're increasing our profitability while simultaneously becoming more aggressive in the pursuit of our next chapter strategy.
Let me now turn to our product announcements and our launches during the first quarter of our 2015 Year of Product.
As I outlined for you last quarter our goal this year is to leverage the improvements made to our transformation to deliver more commercially-attractive and innovative solutions for our clients than ever before.
We're doing this through a combination of organic innovations investments to fill our portfolio gaps and strategic tuck-in acquisitions to more quickly deploy the capabilities our clients need.
And we were excited to introduce several new strategic products and services in Q1 across Terminal Solutions Payment-as-a-Service and Commerce Enablement.
These products and services were very well received by our clients and will begin to generate additional revenue in 2015 and lead to increased earnings growth in the years to come.
Let me begin with new products in our Terminal Solutions business.
There is important work underway to enhance our product suite deliver more certified terminals in markets where we do not yet have a full range of certified product and of course prepare for the launch of our next-generation devices at the end of this year.
VeriFone's new generation of terminals will do much more than enable secure card payments.
These powerful terminals will function as network endpoints that create consumer experiences that help merchants grow their businesses.
They leapfrog today's terminals and deliver superior design industrial security increased processing capacity greater memory and better screen dynamics.
They will be the ideal consumer-facing devices to engage with consumer smartphones and deliver targeted advertising digital loyalty coupons offers and more a really good pairing to all the devices that you see coming out of Apple and Samsung all driving new commerce.
The rollout of these devices will be a tangible proof point that VeriFone has transformed into a true global product and services company.
We are seriously excited about what this means for our clients and stakeholders.
Also in Q1 we announced an important new suite of mobile products.
Our clients told us that they want mobile terminals that are more flexible future-proof and operate at a lower total cost of ownership.
As a result we demonstrated several new products at the National Retail Federation Trade Show in New York City in January including a new mobile terminal solution which we called the e355 which integrates seamlessly with any consumer tablet or smartphone.
Our engineers successfully broke the mold by developing a sleek integrated terminal that is no longer married to the form factor or operating system of a particular device such as an iPhone an Android tablet or a Windows device.
Next month we will take our mobile product suite further by launching an Android-based cloud point-of-sale solution for small- and medium-sized businesses and select enterprise clients.
This is a complete upgrade to our existing mPOS software solution.
And when paired with our traditional and new mobile terminals we can soon deliver a complete tablet point-of-sale solution to our clients and partners who serve the SMB market.
Our goals in delivering this solution were really accelerated by tuck-in acquisition of GoPago a small but scalable product in this space.
Our new mobile terminal and cloud mPOS offering are designed to meet the needs of acquirers and distributors seeking to provide packaged end-to-end mobile solutions including hardware software field services gateways and other assets to fully address the SMB markets.
Q1 also saw progress in our effort to roll out a more value-priced terminal solution for China.
And China is a really unique market and VeriFone had previously attempted to address the entire market with global solutions.
Although our global solutions continued to be well received by certain segments of the China market they do not adapt well enough to the growing low-end of the China market.
To address this gap in China we now have a senior management team and a dedicated R&amp;D team working to execute a strategy to address all the client segments in this important market for VeriFone.
And I'm pleased to report that this new team has successfully brought the first of our ultra-value priced terminals out of pilot.
Now to be sure China is a long-term commitment and we have a lot more work to do but we're pleased with our progress in the quarter.
And there was really much more momentum in Q1 for our Terminal Solutions business.
They launched a new 3G product device in several markets in Latin America made progress in the expansion of the Turkey ECR terminal line and they released a new version of our entry-level PIN pad.
Also our incremental investments in EMV certifications have really paid dividends in our traditional North American SMB business by helping us to get more EMV capable product and pay-at-the-table solutions into the market in order to meet growing demand.
Turning to our 2015 Year of Product work in Payment-as-a-Service.
We are expanding this business globally to help our clients accept a growing field of payment form factors improved security lower their total cost of ownership reduce their compliance burden and increase visibility into their business performance.
Today VeriFone provides Payment-as-a-Service in 15 countries and we will end the year with 17 countries.
Our efforts in the quarter led to important new client engagements in the United States the U.K.
and Turkey.
And we expect additional growth in Australia in Mexico Poland and South Africa throughout the year.
Geographic expansion takes time and investment but it does result in annuity revenues in the years to come.
Security remains a major driver for our Payment-as-a-Service offering and we made good progress on this in Q1.
In the U.S.
and U.K.
we saw continued client momentum for our end-to-end encryption solutions including commitments from one of the world's largest fast food restaurant operators and one of the Europe's largest home improvement retailers.
We continue to invest in consolidating VeriFone's numerous estate management solutions to provide our clients with a single global offering called VHQ that improves security and lowers cost of ownership by providing enhanced global reporting content management and marketing capabilities over the installed fleets that our clients operate.
And we released a new version of the solution in the quarter.
And we continue to earn commitments in Q1 from U.S.
merchants and acquirers for our next-generation Secure Commerce Architecture solution which improves payment data security while also accelerating EMV certifications and implementation.
In Q1 alone we signed or announced new agreements with Vantiv and TransFirst.
And now have merchant commitments to connect more than 150 000 new devices through SCA.
Finally in Commerce Enablement we are operationalizing our connected terminals and digital media screens that help merchants grow their revenues.
Last quarter I outlined our key areas of focus for Commerce Enablement.
In Q1 our primary focus was on further building our media network and our value-added services.
In our media business we launched new global media management solutions starting in Germany one of our largest markets.
Soon our retail clients and advertising partners will be able to utilize the full multimedia capabilities of our existing terminals to deliver targeted content to consumers before during and after making transactions on VeriFone devices.
Initial interest for this product from our retail partners has been strong and we plan to expand availability of this product initially throughout Europe in the coming quarters.
Consistent with our next-generation application and services architecture we also grew our network of screens across our global verticals in Q1.
We made progress in delivering a petro media payment and site solution fueled by new products as well as our partnership with Gilbarco Veeder-Root which will begin to scale in 2016 and merchant preparation for EMV.
We began piloting our new taxi solution in Istanbul as we begin the rollout of a two-year ramp-up deployment of up to 18 000 taxies.
And in the U.K.
we introduced our first 50 digital taxi tops in London and plan to install an additional 150 digital taxi tops in Q2.
In the area of triggers where we deploy beaconized terminals to create consumer commerce and omni-channel experience throughout the store we demonstrated a wonderful proof-of-concept where VeriFone MX 900 Series devices were fitted with beacons and successfully delivered targeted marketing contact to consumer smartphones.
And finally we made progress in the quarter developing a new marketplace or app store for developers to distribute certified applications to our global network of devices and media screens.
As you can see we're executing our transformation and we're accelerating new product launches for our 2015 Year of Product.
We're excited about the work we've accomplished in Q1 and in the opportunity that lays ahead for the remainder of FY 2015 and beyond.
With that I'll now turn the call over to my partner our CFO Marc Rothman.
Marc? Okay thank you Paul.
Consistent with the company's past practice we will be referring to certain financial statement information on a non-GAAP basis.
For our first fiscal quarter we exceeded our overall financial expectations despite the foreign exchange and macroeconomic headwinds in Russia.
We reported net revenues of $487 million compared to our guidance of $480 million to $485 million.
Our revenues were up 11% from a year ago.
And on a constant currency basis revenue was up 16.5%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.44 also exceeding our guidance of $0.40 per share.
This compares to non-GAAP earnings per share of last quarter of $0.44 and $0.31 a year ago.
Let me now discuss our results by region.
In North America record revenues of $160 million were up 8% sequentially and 31% year-over-year.
Our strong North America revenue performance reflects several factors.
First significant momentum continues in our U.S.
multi-lane retail business where we delivered 18% growth sequentially and 44% growth from last year.
Large retailers continue to upgrade to EMV in the U.S.
with our MX 900 Series terminals and new merchants are buying consumer-facing terminals for the first time to prepare for EMV card acceptance.
For example in the hospitality sector we also have seven new major client wins this quarter.
In our SMB vertical we delivered 15% sequential improvement and 49% growth on a year-over-year basis.
We are growing our SMB business by delivering a broader base of certified products across U.S.
acquirers and benefiting from market tailwinds in security and EMV-related upgrades.
Our U.S.
petro revenue was comparable to a strong Q4 and up 16% year-over-year.
We continue to see good momentum resulting from our recently launched next-generation end-to-end in-store point-of-sale solutions.
In addition EMV is creating momentum for convenience stores to upgrade and we are well positioned once again with our MX 900 Series product line.
We expect a strong fiscal year 2015 for our petro business.
And finally in North America net revenues on our taxi payment transaction and media business we're comparable both sequentially and year-over-year.
Our increases in card payment transactions and digital media were offset by lower advertising revenues approximately $1 million on traditional static taxi tops.
In Latin America revenue for the first quarter was $71 million down 13% sequentially but up 4% year-over-year.
In the quarter Brazil revenues were lower sequentially reflecting normal quarterly competitive dynamics.
Highlights elsewhere in Latin America include record shipments to Argentina a new win with Multicaja in Chile and initial deliveries of 3G counter top terminals to Bancomer in Mexico that we announced last quarter.
In Europe Middle East and Africa revenues of $181 million were down 5% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year.
This reflects FX headwinds as well as lower sales in Russia due to political and economic issues.
Partially offsetting these challenges we enjoyed sequential increases in Germany Spain Portugal and Italy from higher product demand as well as stronger sales in Turkey including a significant award for integrated contact solutions from Yapi Kredi Bank one of the country's largest acquirers.
We also won a regional tender with Ecobank to deliver devices throughout 26 African countries in the last three quarters of FY 2015.
And as a result of this higher transaction volume revenues in EMEA on a constant currency basis actually grew 4% year-over-year.
And finally in Asia Q1 revenues of $75 million were up 7% sequentially and 24% from the prior year.
And on constant currency terms year-over-year growth was 28%.
In China despite the fact that we are in the early days of rolling out a value-priced product portfolio we achieved good revenues attributable to successful tenders with major banks.
In Australia and New Zealand we delivered 8% year-on-year growth reflecting our progress on delivering Payment-as-a-Service offerings.
Now let's discuss our results by product line.
Revenue for system solutions were $313 million in Q1 up 20% year-on-year.
Service revenues were $174 million in Q1 that was down 1% year-over-year.
However on a constant currency basis revenues were up 5% year-over-year as we continue to develop new service offerings expand our media and taxi footprint execute our gateway transformation work and accelerate a geographic expansion to grow our services franchise.
Now turning to gross margin performance.
Our consolidated gross margin was 42.4%.
This is comparable on both sequential and year-over-year basis.
For system solutions our hardware gross margin improved to 42.4% of revenue from 41.5% last quarter reflecting both strong U.S.
growth and supply chain savings.
Our services gross margin decreased to 42.4% from 43.6% in the prior quarter primarily due to lower traditional taxi top media revenues of $1 million.
Consolidated operating expenses during the quarter were $136 million a $3 million decrease sequentially.
The improvement reflects efficiency gains from our ongoing transformation initiatives some foreign exchange benefits and the timing of certain research and development expenditure.
We will continue to focus intensely on cost optimization while investing thoughtfully on next-generation products and services and transforming our back office operations.
On our capital structure we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $241 million gross debt of $863 million and net debt of $622 million.
We continue our focus on deleveraging and again reduce gross debt this time by an additional $20 million during the quarter.
Now I would like to discuss our balance sheet and working capital metrics.
Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $287 million and our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved by 3 days on a sequential basis to 53 days.
This is the best DSO figure the company has had in over four years.
Our inventory balance increased to $138 million and our inventory days outstanding increased by 4 days to 42 days.
Accounts payable ended the quarter at $146 million a decrease of $15 million quarter-over-quarter representing a decrease in days payable of 4 days to 47 days.
Overall our cash conversion cycle which was 48 days in Q1 has improved by 13 days compared to a year ago.
Our focus on cash flow metrics and working capital continues to strengthen our balance sheet.
And for Q1 working capital as a percentage of revenue was 14.3% significantly better than the 15.7% level a year ago.
Now some highlights now on our cash flow results.
In the first quarter of 2015 cash flow from operations was $41 million and our free cash flow was $22 million.
Capital expenditures were $20 million in the quarter and approximately half of those expenditures included equipment for our Payment-as-a-Service taxi and media businesses where we invest and deploy systems that we expect to generate service revenues over many years to come.
And lastly let me discuss our financial guidance.
We are updating our FY 2015 guidance to reflect a significant increase in the strength of the U.S.
dollar and additional economic pressure in Russia since the last time that we gave guidance back in mid-December.
These macro headwinds are expected to be offset substantially by better-than-anticipated strength in our core client business and operations across our geographies particularly North America.
The financial details of this update for the remainder of FY 2015 included in our revenue guidance are as follows: $60 million incremental reduction in revenue due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation that's $60 million; $25 million reduction due to Russian economic pressures and this is offset by $50 million in incremental revenue expected from the strength of our core client businesses.
These three items in the aggregate resulted in reduction in revenues of approximately $35 million and an updated FY 2015 guidance of $1.990 billion to $2.0 billion.
For the full fiscal year 2015 our EPS guidance is as follows and we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.82 which is a reduction of $0.08 from the high and $0.07 from the low-end of our previous guidance reflecting the net revenue impact that I just reviewed further offset by our Q1 over-achievement and ongoing cost optimization.
For Q2 FY 2015 we are guiding our non-GAAP revenues in the range of $485 million to $489 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.41 per share to $0.42 per share.
Additionally we expect fiscal year 2015's free cash flow generation to be approximately $140 million to $150 million.
Please refer to our slide 17 in our earnings presentation for additional forward-looking financial information.
Thank you very much.
And with that let me now turn the call back to Paul before we open it up for questions.
Thank you Marc.
Before we move to Q&amp;A I would really like to reiterate how pleased I am with the team's performance in the quarter.
As Marc has explained we believe that while our results exceeded our guidance once again for the quarter they were really muted by strong FX and macroeconomic headwinds something that may very well continue to impact us for the remainder of the year.
More importantly however we believe that our continued business performance has and will offset a meaningful portion of this additional drag.
The team is really executing well.
Our plan is working and we're going to continue as planned with our transformation and on executing the Year of Product.
So with that we now open the call to your questions.
Steve? Thank you.
And stand by for your first question which comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.
Please go ahead.
Thanks.
Good afternoon guys.
So well good to see that I guess in constant currency terms your revenue guidance is actually going up based on this math correct? Correct.
Okay okay so that's obviously encouraging.
So now if we think about the flow-through down to EPS I guess the EPS cut is a little bit more in percentage terms than the revenue cut is that just because you don't have enough natural currency hedge on the expense side given how much your COGS are in dollars? First of all Jason thanks for the question.
So in terms of the FX exposure I highlighted as the $60 million of additional exposure in our guidance and that is somewhat offset it's somewhat muted by the cost that we incur in like currencies there's a major basket of currencies that we operate in euro the pound the Australian dollar and a few others but about 60% of that is covering the revenue exposure.
So the net 40% is what translates into the EPS impact.
Okay understood.
And then just to clarify I know this was a big discussion topic kind of intra-quarter but which of your non-U.S.
countries have the most significant amount of pricing that are done in dollars and has there been any material amount of discounting or extra competitive activity in these countries just given how much other currencies have depreciated versus the dollar in recent months? Well if I understand your question Jason there is a number of other currencies that we – there are a number of foreign operations that are in...
In U.S.
dollars.
...U.S.
dollars.
Yeah.
We do price for example in Brazil in the real but we do like our competitors update pricing to reflect the movement in U.S.
dollar currency as an example.
I think China to some extent holds true there as well.
So when I think about – to give you some more transparency when I think about the amount of revenue exposed to the U.S.
dollar it's about half.
So about 70% of our revenues come from the U.S.
North America market but about – excuse me – about 30% come from the U.S.
North American market 70% outside but about 50%.
So if you look at our $2 billion of high-end guidance about half of that comes from currency other than U.S.
dollars.
Okay.
And then just last one congrats on the progress you're making in the core business.
Paul maybe one for you.
I know last quarter you gave some really helpful statistics in terms of the estimated U.S.
EMV penetration from merchants of various sizes and where you expect those to be by the time the liability shift goes into effect in October.
Any update on those metrics? Yeah.
Thanks Jason.
I'll give you the sort of the big picture here right.
So in the United States today there are roughly 10 million terminals.
We've said that we think in addition to that 10 million there is 3 million greenfield opportunities where people are accepting cards but without a terminal right.
They may be using a keyboard magnetic stripe reader or some other kind of thing.
It's not a client-facing terminal.
So that's how you get to 13 million.
By the way I've seen greenfield estimates north of that but we're kind of comfortable at the 3 million.
So in Tier 1 right which we call the top 200 retailers we know there is about 1.8 million terminals 70% of those were EMV capable in 2014 say October of 2014.
By October of 2015 90% of them will be EMV capable.
So if you think about today there is about 540 000 lanes or terminals that don't have working EMV those are going to get mostly covered.
In mid-tier it's the 201st through the 1 000 largest retailer there is about 600 000 total lanes about 460 000 lanes of those have terminals.
We think there's a greenfield opportunity of about 140 000 lanes.
So if we're just looking at the total terminals that are in that mid-tier 460 000 total terminals 37% of them we think were capable – EMV capable in 2014.
We think about close to 60% will be EMV capable by October of 2015.
So again including greenfield if you think about 600 000 that's 460 000 total terminals plus 140 000 terminals additional you get about 430 000 terminals that are still not EMV.
SMB is the big one.
SMB has about 9.1 million lanes.
We think about close to 7 million terminals call it 6.8 million terminals with a 2.3 million greenfield opportunity.
If you look at where we were EMV capable in October of 2014 against the 6.8 million terminals about 22%.
Looking out at this year we estimate close to 40%.
So you're talking about quite a lot of opportunity.
7.6 million lanes today in SMB in the United States we don't think have EMV that of course includes greenfield.
And in that by the way is SMB hospitality.
And then the only other one that's pretty big is the enterprise hospitality right.
There's about 1 million lanes only about 240 000 of them have any terminals at all.
And so you're talking about 760 000 greenfield.
And against the 1 million total lanes only 12% were EMV in 2014.
We think about a quarter of them will be EMV by 2015 right.
So that's how we get – and then there's other stuff like outdoor petro which has virtually no EMV at all today and that's another 1 million or so lanes in opportunity.
So that's kind of big picture.
If you look at the U.S.
you got 33% that were EMV in 2014 and 52% in 2015.
If you include greenfield to get to the 13 million terminals you're at 24% in 2014 and you're going to be about 40% in 2015.
Okay understood.
Thanks for all the detail.
Thank you Jason.
And your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.
Thanks guys.
That was great color.
I was wondering if you could reconcile that a little bit with the commentary that you guys put in your filings and I know you don't have the Q out yet but when we look back at the K I think you've called out like $18.6 million attributable to EMV.
I'm not sure if that's just all multi-lane retail or if that's encapsulating all the stuff that you're just kind of ran through Paul.
So can you just help me with that? Yeah it would definitely be just Tier 1.
It wouldn't be the total amount.
But I got to be honest with you I don't recognize that number of the top of my head I'll have to look into it.
Okay.
Most of the growth that VeriFone has seen in EMV has come from Tier 1 and you are now just starting to see it in SMB.
Okay.
And is it fair to say that as we think about there's kind of like two different types of terminals when we think about rolling through those statistics.
One is the consumer-facing terminal that you maybe mentioned is Starbucks which I suspect is going to be lower in price point not because it's Starbucks but because it's kind of an add-on to an integrated box.
And the second I guess would be more of the ASP that we might get with SMB which will be higher.
Is that a fair characterization or am I thinking about that inaccurately? You're thinking about that accurately.
For a Starbucks type company who has got a pretty big investment already in their cash register system they got that nice little scanner.
You're talking about a PIN pad that can accept EMV and it can allow a person to put in the code for their debit card that is a lower price point than a fully functioning terminal.
And so that's really the major difference.
And SMB by and large when they move from the keyboard magnetic stripe to a terminal they're buying a full functioning terminal.
Got it.
One last one real quick.
Are you seeing when you think about the opportunity and this is probably getting more North American-centric really but are you seeing more opportunities as a result of unit sales or really wrapping all these incremental services around your existing kind of book of merchants? And then I just wanted to add on and then I'll hop off.
The petro opportunity obviously is significant.
I'm just wondering to what extent the kind of Commerce Enablement opportunity is dependent upon converting those petro stations really to EMV.
Thanks.
Okay great.
So on the first one in North America we are clearly seeing more units.
We're seeing more units as we start to really address EMV in earnest and then also we're seeing more services SCA as an example a lot more encryption work.
I think you're seeing some of the people that traditionally were buying a terminal now looking at Payment-as-a-Service; in other words renting a terminal and having us manage the environment.
In terms of petro petro is – EMV in petro has nothing to do with Commerce Enablement.
EMV in petro is really a function of two things.
Today our petro business by and large is inside of the convenience store attached to a gas station.
Okay? We have virtually nothing in the gas pump.
Our business is the terminal inside the convenience store.
We also have the site controller that's that piece of hardware and software that controls what translates from somebody pumping gas to what they are being charged.
I think what you're seeing us now do is move into actually the pump itself and it's the pump that is going to require EMV upgrade by 2017.
We're well positioned there.
You saw us do deals with Sunoco Tesoro CITGO you obviously saw the Gilbarco deal.
And inside the convenience store right that's really not EMV capable today.
So we have all those things to upgrade as well.
If you want to think about it as revenue pools we are moving from about a revenue pool call it $250 million that we've been playing in to now a revenue pool that's closer to about $500 million that we're playing in.
And we have about 50% of the first one right and we're going to certainly do our level best to get a big percentage of the second one.
That makes sense? Yep that's great.
Thank you very much.
Sure.
Thank you.
And your next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
Please go ahead.
Hi great thanks for the update.
I just wanted to ask on the systems versus services outlook.
First of all how did services come in versus plan this quarter and any sort of new thoughts on how those two lines should shape up for the rest of the year given what we saw in the first quarter? Thanks Tien-Tsin.
Thanks for the question.
So as I mentioned services revenues were $174 million this quarter and it was down sequentially that's also down from last year and a lot of that had to do with FX.
In fact if you normalize it to constant currency it actually would have been up 5% year-over-year but our services line is going to certainly feel the pressure for the next coming quarters as a result of the FX because the services business is disproportionately if you will in regions that are non-U.S.
dollar denominated.
So I think overall for the year comp to last year's absolute dollars we'll see a slight downtick in revenues on the services line.
And of course with the momentum elsewhere particularly in North America there is an incredible strength on the system solutions side.
So the guidance that roughly is mid-6% on the high and low a little bit higher than that 6.4% to 6.9% off of the last year's numbers it's heavily weighted growth on the system solutions side.
Having said that if you were to normalize the services business for constant currency it would be showing significant growth.
So the core is still strong.
I highlighted a couple of small challenges they've been consistent but they're small in the traditional static taxi business.
But we're continuing to invest and make progress in the Payment-as-a-Service business the petro space media.
So we're optimistic we're just being punished pretty badly by the FX headwinds.
Okay.
Let me just add one more thing to that because I think it's important.
Our services business – our services business now is significantly better than our services business a year ago.
The sales cycle on services takes a lot longer.
And so between the FX and the fact that even if we have take my word a better set of products and solutions to offer in our Payment-as-a-Service business it's going to take longer to get that sale and to get that revenue ramp-up than say selling a bunch of terminals.
So I think you've got to read a little bit between the lines which is to say yeah we're getting clobbered on FX but the core client business is better and stronger and you just know that by the dialogue and where we are in the sales process with the new clients.
And as I said we're in 15 markets we'll be in 17 markets.
VeriFone sells its products in 150 markets.
We've got a long way to go here and a lot of upside.
We just have to stick with it.
Thank you Tien-Tsin.
Understood.
So be patient with the backlog and the pipeline on services.
One more if you don't mind just on Russia just to clarify is that a global unit growth issue with Russia or are we seeing some share leakage potentially in the region.
Just wanted to clarify.
That's all I had.
Thanks.
I don't believe that Russia is a share issue.
I think it's a broader macro issue that's impacting many but of course us in our industry.
Okay thank you.
Thank you Tien-Tsin.
And your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.
Please go ahead.
Inc.</span></strong> Thanks guys.
I just want to start off.
I mean your overall constant currency revenue growth I think you said 16.5% was above our estimate and it wasn't just North America.
I have two questions.
Let me just start off with international first and then a follow up to other questions on North America.
Just quickly on international.
I mean we saw Latin America growth of 15% constant currency and APAC growth over 25% I think.
Was there anything unusual in there or unsustainable in either of those regions that we should be aware of that may not be considered sustainable or we couldn't extrapolate of this revenue base just quarterly revenue run rate on a constant currency basis first of all? Well I'd like to there's a lot in that question but high-level the core business across the globe is very very strong.
I don't have anything in particular to call out.
So yeah I think that the numbers for Q1 speak for themselves across the board on a constant currency basis the underlying business is very very strong and I expect that to continue.
I'd say areas that Paul and I highlighted in China we know that we're behind the market in that country and we've made some significant management changes and we're investing in research and development and product but these are long cycle events.
And if there is probably one area that we're still underperforming the market it's probably in China.
So we keep an eye on it and we're focused on fixing it.
But I don't think we had any kind of – Darrin I don't think we had any major one-timers if that's what you're getting up.
So the...
Inc.</span></strong> Yeah that is.
I was just trying to make sure we can extrapolate of the quarterly revenue like level on a constant – that's helpful.
Just a quick follow up to all the questions on North America when we look at these growth rates 44% multi-lane and 50% almost in SMB I guess 32% overall I mean the real question I think we're getting from clients and is really around just what your sustainable growth rate is given the EMV how much of the EMV actually help the quarter how much is it going to help the year? And then I guess on top of that you are gaining market share or benefiting from what's a more sustainable bigger TAM as you mentioned the greenfield opportunities.
Are you winning sort of an outsized market share of those new greenfield opportunities also? It sounds like you're doing pretty well with the – I think you mentioned seven wins in hospitality.
So just a little color on that would be helpful.
Sure.
Couple of things.
Again I don't see a cliff in North America business.
I've heard it called the bubble I've heard it called a lot of things.
As I said depending on how you count if you believe my greenfield 60% of the total number of terminals in the United States have yet to be upgraded.
Okay? So – and that's assuming we get to October 15 and we're at 40%.
The 60% still have a way to go.
Whether those things get upgraded faster because merchants are concerned about liability shift or more because consumers show up with chip and PIN cards and say hey how come you're not accepting a chip and PIN card because they feel that there is security.
I still think there is a long way to go.
I also think there is a long way on the petroleum side as I said.
There are zero EMV readers practically in pumps.
There is a 2017 liability shift date and we positioned ourselves strategically to take advantage of it.
So that's one.
In terms of how we're doing against market share I think in the United States first of all our brand has always punched above its – above that of our competitors.
I think U.S.
clients trust the VeriFone brand.
I think that in terms of competitive takeaways I know in Q1 there was at least – there were at least eight that I'm aware of and we took business away from Ingenico Infinite Peripherals and Equinox with big names.
So I know we're winning I don't think we're losing much.
I think in the Tier 1 we have something like a 97% or a 98% retention rate.
So I feel like we're doing well.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Great I think that's it from me.
Thanks guys.
Appreciate it.
And your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler from Stifel.
Please go ahead.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi thanks good afternoon.
I actually had a follow up to Darrin's question on that same topic.
I guess I'm trying to understand the strong performance in the U.S.
I think you're talking about a little bit of market share potentially.
But is the sequential acceleration we're seeing in both North America both multi-lane and SMB is that more of an acceleration in EMV adoption? And it seems like it's above your plan.
So was there a noticeable pickup in the quarter of merchants both large and small making the upgrade? Yes Chris that's exactly what happened.
I mean we were keying off of history.
We then made adjustments because we knew obviously with a due date people will start to cut a press.
We didn't quite expect as much as we've been seeing.
We certainly knew that Tier 1 space in and out so that we could predict pretty well.
I think we also predicted mid-tier.
The SMB was really a wildcard and it outperformed and the enterprise hospitality outperformed.
So those were the ones that we saw a pickup and we're glad.
I think it will sustain for a while.
And I just – I get sometimes lost a little bit in scale here.
The U.S.
market is a big big market and if it's got to turn over there's a lot of opportunity and that's what we're really focused on.
No stone is left unturned.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> That sounds great.
I guess one more follow up on that topic is to the extent that some of the new product introductions you've had in SMB is that having a meaningful impact at this point or is it more that the SMB channel started to upgrade faster? And then an unrelated question can you just give us an update on the advertising market and the trends you're seeing there? Thanks.
Sure.
I think the biggest improvement – first of all whenever we launch a new product it takes a while for it to ramp up.
So if we launch something in Q1 it probably didn't contribute meaningfully to revenues.
It takes a while.
The biggest driver of revenue growth for us in SMB market is really certifications.
How many acquirers can we certify with our products and not just eight products but a full range of products which is what SMB typically buys they'll buy countertops and PIN pads and they'll buy portables and you got to have the full gamut.
And we've been working so hard to improve our relationships with the acquirers and for the past year and a half it's really helped us to get an audience present our roadmap deliver on innovation and then they allow us to certify that's really the biggest driver.
In terms of advertising advertising is not a standalone business for us.
We don't think of it as standalone business.
We think of it as a massive enabler to our ambition in Commerce Enablement.
So that advertising knowhow the technology that we use that is going to help our merchants to do more with these terminals.
I think about our next-generation of terminal solutions by the way as having as much on the broadcast side as they do on the receiving side.
Traditionally terminals have all been about let me accept the card so it's a consumer pushing data in their card number.
Going forward I view these things as having really a back and forth conversation give me your card number let me push something out to you.
And so Commerce Enablement is about having that push out message be really robust and having advertising screens is essential to that whether in taxi cabs whether in the petrol stations or in the checkout lines right and we think there is an important play here.
We're certainly investing in it and we'll see if it does what we think it will do.
In terms of the only business that really doesn't obviously ship – connect to that in folks' minds is the static taxi top business but in reality that static top business is really really important real estate for us.
When we wanted to have American Express pay with points in taxi cabs it was actually the static top that told consumers they can do it and that's why they started getting into the cabs.
So we like the balance.
We're going to continue investing in both.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Thanks Paul.
Appreciate it.
Sure Chris.
Your next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
Hi Paul and Marc.
In China it seems like you've been making some progress with the ultra value product coming out of pilot.
Can you share with us some of the feedback that you received from clients during the pilot stage? Yeah I'm happy to.
I mean I got to tell you I had pretty good expectations that we were going to listen to clients carefully understand their needs understand what it is in our R&amp;D and supply chain and engineering and manufacturing that we need to change and then we were going to produce a product that was going to really hit the mark on the low-end of the China segment which I got to tell you had some pretty spectacularly low prices associated with it.
And there's also some feature function tradeoff to be sure.
So we produced our first payment terminal with that type of approach with that type of framework it hit the mark.
It's not a today PCI-certified device so that's the next thing.
Let's get that type of low-cost feature that spoke to that market device and let's now get PCI 4.0 certification.
So I'll know whether this thing is a home run or not or sort of lives up to our expectations probably later in the year when the thing leads PCI certification.
And regarding the feedback that you've gotten from clients I mean has it – have people been mainly happy due to the price of the product is there any other features of the product that stands out versus what's being sold by other competitors in the market at the moment? I think that they're just happy because we've actually woken up to the fact that we haven't been doing it right and we started to listen to them.
I mean we brought a global product to China and there were clients in China that love it because they're somewhat global in their approach.
The minute we went into really local Chinese and how they view what they need we just weren't listening carefully that's why Marc talked about the change in the team.
We just needed a more focused folk.
In terms of whether it hits the mark I really think it's early days.
I don't know.
I'm just happy with our – that we're on the right track but we – as I said we got a long way to go in China we are not getting a big share of that market that we should be.
Thank you.
Thank you Smitti.
And your next question from the line of Dain Haukos from Piper Jaffray.
Please go ahead.
Hi guys.
Thanks for taking my questions.
I'm on for Mike Grondahl today.
I'm curious it looks like you're focusing on using some of those free cash flow that continue to de-lever is there a targeted ratio that you're looking at or a certain level that you're looking to get to on the leverage front and then where do you think you will go from there once you reach that level or what were your thoughts behind uses of cash be at that point? Hi Dain.
This is Marc.
Thanks for the question on cash flow and leverage.
We've been obviously in the mode of deleveraging.
You know we have refinanced our term loan A B revolving credit facility back in Q3 of last year.
So our intention is to continue to use excess cash flow to de-lever.
Having said that we're not out of the M&amp;A space.
We – Paul highlighted a transaction – a small transaction that we did actually in Q2.
So we're looking to give ourselves some flexibility with the excess cash flow.
So to the extent we're not doing M&amp;A the intent would be to use it to de-lever and to the extent we need resources we'll work off of our revolving credit facility and our excess cash.
Okay that's great.
And then where are you guys at in terms of run rate savings on – in the as you keep realigning the cost structure? I think you had originally thought about $35 million I think last call it was around $40 million is that still the level? Yeah.
Last call I updated the overall savings to be around $40 million actually slightly in excess.
You could see that we – in our slides we took the OpEx numbers down from high-$65 million a portion of that happens to be the benefit that we get from the foreign exchange.
But we're continuing to invest in the back office.
We're continuing to invest in getting our infrastructure and foundation real solid and of course in the new businesses.
And I would expect that going into 2016 that we'll begin to realize some of those savings particularly around the R&amp;D reorganization the consolidation into a smaller footprint as one example.
I'll be in a better position to give you an update on OpEx targets really in the coming couple of quarters but it's certainly trending in the right direction and we're continuing to look at efficiencies across the organization.
Okay thank you.
And then last one for me how are conversations with clients going as we approach the liability shift as far as the security platforms and management of that whole process because I know that last time it sounded unlike there is a lot of clients that are going to have issues with managing that transfer? There is certainly no less complexity today than there was the last time we spoke about it.
Clients are anxious to hit their dates.
We have been working with those clients especially Tier 1 and especially the large acquirers very very intensively.
It is a – you can think of VeriFone right now in North America as a giant project plan right.
There are war rooms everywhere to make dates and such.
SCA as I mentioned we now have commitments to connect 150 000 terminals that's a lot of terminals going onto a platform and that is really to deliver on EMV certification faster.
So we are absolutely in full execution mode across everything we do to hit as many dates as possible.
You're not going to have a 100% of the merchants ready but you're going to have an awful lot of the Tier 1s ready.
Thank you.
Thank you Dain.
And your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous.
Please go ahead.
Hey Craig are you there? We can't hear you.
Might be on mute.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Regarding Starbucks is there an opportunity A to expand beyond just simple PIN pads or client-facing EMV type additions to more of the cash register plus is it an opportunity globally for VeriFone? Secondly if you could just size sort of the headline pricing what you might be deploying at Starbucks versus when you're deploying MX 900.
Thanks.
Well let's think a bit on the last part of the question and let me talk about the first part.
Starbucks is a PIN pad implementation it is so that they can accept EMV cards and that is not uncommon I think you'll find in that type of setting.
As I said they have a – they've invested an awful lot of money in their infrastructure for taking payments.
As you know they have their own Wallet app it's extraordinarily successful.
And we don't really view Starbucks as a North America client we view them as a global client but the first step is North America.
In terms of what drives this adoption and could it go beyond a PIN pad you would really have to believe that this narrative that VeriFone continues to propagate on Commerce Enablement is real.
We certainly think it is.
If in fact we're able to show that these terminals are an important part of helping merchants to attract new consumers and grow their business then the way in which one might view the opportunity of getting the merchant to upgrade or to buy isn't so much on EMV and security as much as it is on you know what I want to create a great consumer experience against their digital wallet or even with their card.
And so that type of opportunity I don't have baked into my Starbucks numbers but I can imagine if this team here at VeriFone does a great job that a company like Starbucks might certainly be open to it.
Okay? So that's how you go from the PIN pad to something else.
In terms of the range certainly you could go on the Internet you can find out what MX 900 Series are priced at what PIN pads are priced it's a big difference and the MX 900 device is a much much more powerful much larger much more – has greater capacity device than the PIN pads.
It's going to be multiples.
Okay thank you.
Thank you Craig.
And your next question comes from the line of Meghna Ladha from Susquehanna.
Please go ahead.
Hi.
Thanks for taking my question.
Marc the $60 million FX headwind that you called out is that – I just want to understand is that all translation risk related to the Payment-as-a-Service business in Northern Europe? The $60 million that I called that is broader than that.
It's on the entire VeriFone footprint.
So it goes through all currencies and all regions.
So it would be $60 million of FX impact for the next three quarters including Q2 but no it's more – it's broader than Meghna the Payment-as-a-Service business in Northern Europe.
So does that mean that in markets where you do have pricing flexibility you are seeing an impact from FX? There is.
We're calculating FX broadly across those currencies that are denominated in non-U.S.
dollars where those are – where we're impacted but in some places as you – maybe you're alluding to like in Latin America there are opportunities for us to price adjust but I think the $60 million is a good reflection of the impact that we have for the rest of the year.
Okay.
And then with Brazil are you seeing – I mean can you talk about the pricing environment in Brazil? One of your competitors Ingenico really last week talked about how they're seeing margin pressure from competition and local merchant acquirers? It's – we certainly enjoy our business in Brazil.
There are as you know a few major acquirers that have some pricing power and that market in general tends to be more margin intensive.
So I think we compete well but we compete with challenge.
So generally speaking it is a tougher market and we do see pricing pressure.
More importantly we see the currency issues as well you could see where the Brazilian real has moved over the last – gosh it could be the last week two weeks a month two months and that my point there was we will and we intend to adjust to make sure that we're getting adequate returns on the product that we sell.
But let me just say we're not chasing revenue in Brazil by cutting margin.
So that – we've just not done that.
We look at opportunities to value price.
We value price sometimes we win sometimes we don't but I for one do not see draconian price wars.
I don't know where that is coming from but I don't see it.
Thank you so much.
Thank you Meghna.
Steve we have time for one more question please.
And that question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Please go ahead.
Hey guys.
Thanks for squeezing me in.
I know it's a long call.
Hey Paul you made a number of comments about technology investment and you gave us a ton of detail on initiatives.
I'm wondering – and this may be a little bit of a tough question to answer but if you just qualitatively think about what proportion of your product reengineering is really aimed at streamlining operations and affects cost centers replatforming et cetera and what proportion is focused on greater functionality that can ultimately drive Commerce Enablement or service related revenue.
Should we think about those as being roughly equal initiatives or is there a greater emphasis on one versus the other? And I've got a quick housekeeping follow up for Marc.
There's definitely a greater question on the transformation work; that's just critical for us right now.
Can't succeed with 13 or 8 operating platforms.
It's – as you can imagine just it's a hell of an anchor around your neck.
So we have to put ourselves into a place where we simplify our operations where we standardize things like gateways standardize things like our operating platform.
We got to get to a single chassis design for most of our global product.
A lot of that unfortunately isn't something I can show a client today right.
It's not like I get to show the hey look at all these cool things bells and whistles.
It's all on the back-end.
And that is where we're spending more money today.
That is where the bump in spend comes from.
That is where the transformation costs are coming from.
We try to self fund as much of that as possible.
While we're doing that we are absolutely making progress on the things that make Commerce Enablement work.
And those are things which are new new to VeriFone and whether it's an app store whether it is some of the card linked offer solutions.
Those kinds of things we're investing money in more digital media screens.
But if you said to me what percentage? I'd say that 75% is going to fixing the old 25% is on the new.
Okay that's great.
And so to the extent the investment continues next year those ratios might slide toward 50-50 and perhaps move more toward revenue generating innovation in future periods? That's exactly right.
We're going to continue to invest.
R&amp;D has to be a big portion of our identity.
Innovation has to be a big portion of our culture.
I can't tell you that all the stuff we're doing right now is innovation.
It kind of feels like taking us out of 1998 in certain parts of our business but we will absolutely be a disciplined company and we will ride the innovation curve better in the coming years for sure.
Okay great.
And Marc could you just repeat the FX headwind in services please? What I mentioned in services is that the numbers were down year-on-year and sequentially.
But on a constant currency basis they would have been up 5% year-on-year.
And then I could tell you that they would have been comparable sequentially.
Perfect.
Thank you very much.
You're very welcome.
Thank you Andrew.
So I guess this brings us to the end of our first quarter earnings call and Q&amp;A session.
I want to thank everybody.
I appreciate it.
Perhaps I do go into a bit too much detail but if you saw what was going on here on a daily basis I could tell you that I greatly oversimplified in my comments.
I just thought you guys deserve transparency.
Look as Marc said really tough FX really tough macroeconomics.
Okay? It is what it is.
The next three quarters don't look very pretty when it comes to FX and macroeconomics that's why we demonstrated to you that we think it's an $85 million incremental headwind.
We also said that we in the business are doing a lot better that's true.
Our clients are giving us more business that's true.
And I think the best is yet to come.
Having said that that only allowed us to get comfortable for an incremental $50 million.
So we could not overcome all the FX which was about $60 million and all the weakness in Russia which is about $25 million.
So out of $85 million we covered $50 million and we're certainly not going to stop now but that's where we are today.
So thanks everybody and I look forward to talking with you soon.
Bye-bye.
Thank you for your participation in today's conference.
This concludes the presentation.

Thank you Doug and thank you all for joining us today.
Q2 was an important quarter for us.
We made major strides in client satisfaction and financial performance and we improved our share in key markets.
We also gained visibility in Q2 into how our transformation and our Year Of Product work is proving instrumental in helping us win new business and drive economics in markets where our work on these initiatives is progressing.
This visibility gives us added confidence that this work will drive financial upside in all of our markets in the quarters and years to come.
However despite our good results in the quarter we are not yet far enough along with our transformation and Year of Product work in some important markets.
There are areas where we need to more aggressively accelerate our efforts.
Today I’m going to begin by walking you through some of the highlights from the quarter then I’m going to update you on our transformation and our Year of Product initiatives.
So as I said Q2 was important and it was important for several reasons.
First we delivered revenue and earnings growth of above guidance and grew our earnings per share by 19% year over year.
We accomplished all of this despite adverse foreign exchange and macroeconomic headwinds while executing an aggressive investment program.
I should also note on a constant currency basis versus last year Q2 was a record revenue quarter for VeriFone.
Second our operating profit margins continued to improve year over year as we work to close the gap between us and our main competitor.
Our margin in Q2 was 14.1% an improvement of 130 basis points over the prior year.
Third our North America client business where our transformation in Year of Product work is [indiscernible] outstanding level growing 54% year over year.
It's important to note that our North America results are not simply due to EMV.
We also increased our portfolio of certified terminal solutions successfully launched our new portfolio of mobile terminals and delivered new products and services to our multi-lane retail our SMB and petro clients.
All in all we believe that we again pulled ahead of our competition in these markets.
In Europe where we are also further along in our initiatives our businesses gained share in important markets including the UK Germany Italy Spain and Portugal.
In Latin America we made the decision in the quarter on a go-forward basis to run this market as a separate region.
The opportunities for VeriFone in this region are immense and required dedicated level of focus and resource allocation.
To this end we’re pleased to announce that we’ve hired Carlos Lima previously Chief Operations Officer of Vantiv to run our Latin America market.
Carlos is an experienced operator and has held senior level roles in American Express Barclays Card and Citi where he and I worked together to build the commercial card business.
Jennifer Miles our Head of the Americas for the past two years will now focus on running our North America market building new client verticals for VeriFone and helping us to drive more disciplined relationship management and sales processes on a global basis.
And finally in the quarter we made meaningful progress building out our next generation terminals and product platform.
Our product and engineering teams continue to hit milestone delivery dates for our next generation platform of terminal and mobile solutions.
In the quarter we previewed our new product and services roadmap and terminal prototypes with a few select clients.
Their reaction greatly exceeded our expectations and interest is already high.
To quote one major global client it appears your new product drive spell is over and you guys are now back in the game.
That was an important quote for me.
But as I said while we exceeded expectations in the quarter we’re not yet satisfied.
There are areas of the business where we have tremendous work to do and must move faster and deliver better for our clients.
Fortunately diversity and strength of our global franchise is able to deliver results while we take time to do the necessary work to transform our business.
In Q2 our main challenges were in Asia where our results were disappointing.
I’m actually quite upset about it.
The combination of not yet having delivered a full portfolio of products as well as some inconsistent sales management really hurt us in the quarter.
There are important bright spots to be sure in Asia such as India Australia and New Zealand.
However core sales execution and order delays in places like Indonesia hurt our business.
And in China we are yet to turn the corner and have not gained traction as quickly as we need.
As I stated in previous earnings calls our China clients need us to consistently deliver quality products that match our brand promise of cutting-edge security innovation nimbleness and functionality but in a more competitive price point.
We haven’t done this to our satisfaction or to the satisfaction of our clients.
Now we understand fully the root cause of our issues in China and are actively fixing them and we’re accelerating the execution of those fixes and are now taking several significant steps.
First we’re establishing VeriFone China as a separate region to give it the appropriate focus and access to resources it requires.
Second we have now recruited an experienced and highly respected former Chief Executive Officer of a major Chinese terminal manufacturer to head our China franchise reporting directly to me.
I expect that he and our China team will continue to transform our business to be a better more nimble partner to our clients.
And finally we are entering into a strategic partnership with the top five global Asia-based technology design development and manufacturing firm.
Working with our China-based product supply chain and R&amp;D team they will help us accelerate the comprehensive overhaul of our China products and operations.
This will enable us to iterate much faster and more rapidly deliver the products and services that our China clients require.
These are major changes and they’re being very carefully managed to ensure we delight our clients and live up to our potential.
These changes along with additional planned leadership upgrades will fix our issues and deliver positive impact on our business in Asia.
We won’t get there overnight.
In fact it will take many quarters.
But we’re on the right path and continue to be fully committed for the long term.
I look forward to updating you on our progress around our execution in Asia again next quarter.
Turning to our transformation initiatives we’re now approximately two-thirds of the way into this major two-year program.
Each quarter we’re making meaningful progress against our top three VeriFone initiatives.
And over the next couple of quarters we expect to see our efforts really begin to scale.
Rather than taking you through all the categories let me just say that we achieved steady progress on product portfolio management R&amp;D reengineering and cost optimization.
You can view the details of our progress on slide 6 of our presentation.
I do however want to highlight our work in supply chain cost optimization.
Under the leadership of our global head of supply chain Sheetal Shah who joined us approximately 10 months ago we’re completely overhauling this critical function and have already seen material improvement.
Our cumulative 2015 savings is expected to be north of $10 million better than what we achieved last year.
Let me now update you on the execution of our 2015 Year of Product.
I’m going begin with our terminal solutions business where we enhanced our product suite delivered more certified terminals and continued to prepare for the launch of our next generation devices.
Last quarter I updated you on our plans to deliver VeriFone’s next generation family of devices by the end of 2015.
It's an important milestone not just for us but for our clients and partners as these devices are going to enable some truly exciting and distinct consumer experiences and allow us to transition to a single global product platform.
This next generation family of devices now has a name.
We’re branding it VeriFone Engage a name that highlights how these new devices will enable powerful and dynamic two-way engagement at the point of sale between merchants and consumers as put simply just accepting card payments.
In mobility we made progress in the roll out of our new suite of mobile products providing our clients with mobile terminals that are more flexible more future proof and operate at a lower total cost of ownership.
In Q1 we announced the e355 a revolutionary new mobile terminal that integrates seamlessly with most any consumer smart phone or tablet.
In Q2 we were awarded our first major client mandate for the e355 a roll out by one of the largest US wireless carriers across all of its retail stores.
This win was the result of a highly competitive process where VeriFone’s products decisively outperformed the competition.
In our mobile business in the medium to large retail segment is growing at a rapid pace.
In the first half of FY 2015 we tripled our mobile orders versus what we booked in all of last year.
More and more leading retailers and specialty brands are establishing mobile point of sale to engage consumers up sell merchandise and connect to their online inventory throughout the store.
For example Chico's which operates some of the US and Canada’s best known fashion retail brands will now begin rolling out VeriFone’s new E series mobile terminals throughout all its 1 550 locations.
J.
Crew another leading fashion brand also signed on in Q2 to roll out the E series in its US stores.
Also as promised we introduced our new android-based cloud point of sale solution for SMBs in late March.
As I mentioned last quarter this is a complete upgrade of our tablet point of sale offering.
It’s a packaged solution in a box that includes hardware software field services connection to gateways and other assets to fully address the SMB market.
The merchant unpacks the box plugs it in and turns it on simple and powerful.
To date we have already signed more than 90 resellers for this solution and have integrated this system with our industry-leading Vx EMV devices.
We also recently launched a newly designed portable device in Latin America and in Q2 completed certifications with two of the region's largest processors already securing orders for more than 50 000 new VeriFone devices.
In Turkey we hit development milestones for our year-end launch of a new ECR terminal line and in Germany we saw the first sale of our MX series devices to a major European retailer.
Interest in the MX product line is growing throughout Europe and Latin America.
Turning to our 2015 Year of Product work in payment as a service we continue to make progress in expanding this business globally and we achieved significant milestones in Q2.
However we believe our services revenue still isn’t growing as fast as it should.
FX certainly isn’t helping.
But even on a constant currency basis we believe there is significant room for improvement.
The team is aggressively working to address this.
First we’re speeding up delivery of new services and applications to our existing payment as a service clients.
Today we continue to see a steady uptick in the number of clients selecting a premium payment as a service package over a basic one.
And we believe we can further improve adoption of our premium packages by deploying additional new services such as extended service hours merchant transaction reporting and vertical-specific applications and doing it all a lot faster.
Second we are more rapidly expanding our services solutions into new geographies.
At the beginning of the year we were providing payment as a service in 14 markets.
Now we’re in 16 markets and by year end we will be in 18.
We’ve worked very hard to standardize and scale our global gateway offering which is really the key to faster geographic expansion.
Incidentally in Q2 alone VeriFone’s gateways processed approximately 1 billion transactions.
We’re now happy to report that VeriFone will launch our global gateway offering in our first production market in Q3.
We have a clear roadmap and project plans to deploy this global gateway in two additional countries before the end of the year.
This will really speed up our ability to scale.
And third we’re working to transform our repair and field services business into more of a managed services offering.
At a time when we see less growth for one-time repair services by the way a great proof point for the improvements we have continued to make in the quality of our products we also see growing demand from terminal estate owners to completely outsource their terminal fleet management to VeriFone.
Financial institutions and large merchants are increasingly asking us to lift out their existing terminal estates and leverage our full services offering as well as our estate management platform VHQ in return for a monthly fee.
We expect that the actions we’re taking in our payment as a service business will enable us to do more for our clients and to accelerate our growth in the coming quarters.
I would like to share with you one particular payment as a service client success story.
Westpac is one of Australia's big four banks and a VeriFone client.
In April of 2015 we launched a new solution with Westpac where the bank is outsourcing to VeriFone the deployment and management of its entire and growing fleet of about 135 000 payment devices.
With VeriFone as its partner the bank will offer its merchants our latest 3G portable terminal the VX 690 all backed by VeriFone’s call center and field support services and connected to our gateway.
For Westpac the bank receives far better sales conversion faster on-boarding and a lower total cost of ownership.
For VeriFone relationship such as this enable us to become an extension of a financial institution and earn annuity revenues from gateway transactions and recurring support services.
Turning to commerce enablement our largest merchant and financial institution client are continuing to increasingly leverage our secure commerce architecture.
For example in Q2 I’m really delighted to announce that Dunkin’ Brands which own Dunkin’ donuts and Baskin-Robbins awarded VeriFone its US business.
Dunkin’ will leverage our secure commerce architecture our end-to-end encryption and our EMV terminals in all of its stores as part of a payment as a service solution.
But this is just one example.
In the second quarter 31 additional major US merchants signed on for this service that effectively removes consumer payment data from a point of sale register.
As of the second quarter our total pipeline of terminals committed to be connected through this solution now exceeds 200 000 in the US alone pretty impressive considering we had none just six months ago.
I want to note that our traction here is not limited to our direct merchant clients.
Point of sale integrators commonly known as ISPs are increasingly endorsing our solution.
For example we’re now working with two of the leading ISPs Oracle Retail and Microsoft Dynamics on integrating with SCA.
Similarly momentum for our end-to-end encryption solutions continues to mount.
We now have contractual commitments for more than 250 tier 1 and tier 2 retailers to enable encryption of the US consumer transactions and we’re in the process of rolling out point-to-point encryption toolkit across a number of our major partners and acquirers in Europe.
In our media business we grew our stake of consumer-facing digital screens and we now have over 60 000 installed in taxies at the gas pumps and inside convenience stores.
We continue to make steady progress on this growth.
We signed a substantial deal with one of the largest convenience store chains in the US to install LiftRetail our in-store real time marketing solution into more than 4500 of their locations.
We also made the first product shipments to go barcode reader route as part of our global partnership in Q2.
And we’re also working actively with all the major mobile wallet players to increase the adoption of digital payment gift cards loyalty offers and more at the physical point of sale.
In fact Google launched its second generation mobile wallet Android Pay at its Annual I/O conference.
VeriFone was the key partner at launch enabling Android Pay acceptance at a number of large merchants.
Now before I close I want to highlight the important partnership that we announced yesterday with Visa and their global merchant payment management platform CyberSource.
As we have discussed on prior earnings calls VeriFone’s merchants and our financial institution clients are really challenged to provide their consumers with a compelling and seamless omni-channel payment and commerce experience.
Consumers are increasingly demanding this and they’re expecting Amazon-like logistics and an Amazon-like shopping experience from their merchants across all sales channels.
To make this data rich solution work requires seamlessly interoperable functionality and global ubiquity at physical stores and in E&amp;M commerce channels.
To date no service provider has scaled anything that makes this viable.
Our payment as a service and commerce enablement product teams have been working for the past year to engineer the global infrastructure to enable this omni-channel payments and commerce solution.
And they had a really really tough time finding a way to globally scale E&amp;M commerce gateways.
We believe that the price of acquiring or the time it takes to build scale and scale global e-commerce platform management platform is hard for VeriFone to justify.
After a tremendous amount of work I'm really excited to report this global partnership between VeriFone and Visa will allow us to deliver a leading global foundation of connected terminals as well as e-commerce and m-commerce payment management services to our clients.
We believe that this combination will give both VeriFone and Visa the global omni-commerce infrastructure necessary to deliver never-before-available solutions to clients across the globe.
This is a real paradigm shift and a major accomplishment.
The deal is three-fold.
First VeriFone will leverage Visa’s CyberSource gateway along with our own to create a leading cross-channel payment solution with extensive global reach.
This will enable clients using Visa and VeriFone gateways to monitor and manage their online and offline transactions from a common dashboard and have access to real-time payment and commerce data critical to creating superb consumer experiences.
Second Visa will now refer those in its vast client base who desire omni-payment solution to VeriFone for payment terminals and services enabling faster gateway connectivity and seamless integration across online and off-line retail channels.
And third Visa and VeriFone will work together jointly to promote the benefits of VeriFone’s secure commerce architecture for retailers who desire more efficient and less expensive path to enabling EMV and innovation of point of sale.
I’m really excited about this because we will be able to offer our clients a complete integrated and global view of their consumer transactions across their in-store their mobile and their online channels.
Just as one simple example today if a consumer were to buy an item online and then return it in a physical store the merchant would have no record of the exchange on their online channel and would have no information on other purchases that the consumer made in the store.
But with Visa and VeriFone the merchant will be able to follow the customer behavior seamlessly across channels and leverage this new knowledge to nurture the relationship and take [indiscernible] shopping experience.
So to conclude as you can hopefully see we’re making major progress and I really want to put our Q2 results in context.
It should be no surprise that as of this moment we’re not yet done doing as well as we could in all markets.
The work to fix VeriFone takes time and as promised we are not cutting corners.
Our objective is to build a sustainable growth business in payments and commerce enablement.
In markets such as the US and parts of Europe where we’re further along with our work our clients are reacting positively and as a result we’re delivering better financials.
So when I tell you that we’re not fully satisfied with our quarter despite the enormous progress that we've made it’s because we know how much better the results are going to be once our transformation in Year of Product work is further along in the rest of the markets in which we operate.
I’m now going to turn the call over to my partner Marc Rothman.
Marc? Excellent.
Thank you Paul.
Consistent with the company's past practice we will be referring to income statement related information on a non-GAAP basis.
For our second quarter we exceeded our overall financial expectations.
We reported net revenues of $490 million compared to our guidance of $485 million to $489 million.
Our revenues increased 5% from a year ago and excluding the adverse impact of the stronger US dollar on translating foreign revenues growth was actually 14% on a constant currency basis.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.44 also exceeding our guidance of $0.41 to $0.42 per share.
This compares to non-GAAP earnings per share last quarter of $0.44 and $0.37 a year ago.
Let me now discuss our results by region.
In North America we generated record revenues of $193 million representing 20% growth sequentially and 54% year-over-year.
Our strong North American results were driven by a number of factors including success with our EMV product line new certified products momentum with our E series mobile solutions and the availability of new products and services.
Interest in EMV is significant across all key verticals.
Our multi-lien retail team delivered approximately 30% growth sequentially and more than 60% growth from last year.
In the quarter 28 new awards from retailers were attributed directly to the upcoming EMV liability shift.
And this includes 13 new clients deploying our terminals for the first time.
We’re capitalizing on the EMV Greenfield opportunities particularly in enterprise hospitality where certain restaurants and hotels are adopting consumer facing payment devices for the first time.
These new deals include a combination of terminals encryption solutions and related service offerings.
We enjoyed significant mobile wins during the quarter as well and mobility is gaining momentum with the success of our E series devices as part of a complete mobility solution.
Our US petro business delivered approximately 25% sequential growth and over 60% growth on a year over year basis.
This momentum is driven by convenience store demand for EMV readiness upgrades to our next generation commander site controllers and Ruby POS systems.
In addition to current client upgrades we enjoyed several significant new wins during Q2 and we expect continued momentum in this sector.
In our small and medium business vertical we delivered 7% sequential improvement and approximately 50% growth on a year over year basis another very strong quarter driven by market share gains and market expansion.
We are winning business processing and acquiring partners as well as within the iso-channel propelled by EMV and MSC demand and our deliver of additional certified products into this market place.
And finally in North America net revenues on our taxi payment transaction and media business were up approximately 10% sequentially and approximately 14% on a year-over-year basis.
We continued to see increases in card payment transactions and digital media demand.
This is partially offset by slightly lower traditional taxi top advertising revenues.
In Latin America revenues for the second quarter was $68 million down 4% sequentially and 18% year over year.
In constant currency terms revenues were off about 6% from the prior year but up 5% sequentially.
In Brazil we successfully completed certifications for our newly designed VX 685 portable terminal and secured orders from two large processors for second half 2015 delivery which we expect will improve momentum in the region.
In Europe Middle East and Africa revenues of $180 million were comparable sequentially but down 6% from the prior year reflecting FX headwinds and lower sales in Russia as expected.
On a constant currency basis revenues were up 8%.
Across Western Europe we believe our market share improved and we recorded double digit year over year revenue increases on a constant currency basis.
And finally in Asia Q2 revenues of $50 million were down 34% sequentially and down 27% from the prior year.
These declines occurred primarily in China and Indonesia and during the quarter we were challenged by both competitive pressures as well as tender delays.
We’re intensifying our focus on getting the right people products and resources into these two markets including additional investments and upgrades to our regional management team.
And while it will take several quarters to achieve the results we expect we remain optimistic about our opportunities.
Our Australia and New Zealand businesses within the Asia-PAC region continued to expand as we focused on delivering payment as a service solutions into these markets.
Sequentially revenues increased 5% as we made good progress on our deployment with Westpac.
Now let’s discuss our results by product line.
Q2 revenues for system solutions were $324 million up 11% year on year and up 19% on a constant currency basis.
We continued to build momentum across this product line in most regions as we deploy new products globally and benefit from the EMV liability shift in the US.
Our services revenue were $166 million in Q2 down 6% year over year.
However revenues were up 5% on a constant currency basis.
Recall that we have significant service revenues overseas in particular payment as a service business concentrated in the Nordics.
Now turning to gross margin performance our consolidated gross margin was 42.8% up 40 basis points sequentially and up 140 basis points year over year.
Let me break this down briefly by product line.
For system solutions our hardware gross margin improved to 43.1% of revenue from 42.4% last quarter reflecting both strong US growth and our supply chain initiatives.
Service gross margin of 42.1% was down 30 basis points compared to the prior year.
Consolidated operating expenses during the quarter were $140 million as planned a $4 million increase sequentially.
This increase reflects additional investment related to our transformation as well as increased revenues.
On our capital structure we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $234 million gross debt was $843 million and net debt of $609 million.
We continue our focus on deleveraging and again repaid $20 million of debt during the quarter.
Now I’d like to discuss our balance sheet and working capital metrics in more detail.
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $328 million and our days sales outstanding increased to 60 days from a record low of 53 days last quarter.
This increase reflects higher sales in the third month of our quarter as compared with Q1 as North America demand improved significantly.
Our inventory balance decreased to $129 million from $138 million last quarter and inventory days outstanding of 43 days were comparable to the last quarter.
And lastly our accounts payable ended the quarter at $171 million representing an increase in days payable of 8 days to 55 days which correlates with our inventory purchases as well as timing of payments to vendors.
Overall our cash conversion cycle was 48 days in Q2 which was comparable to both Q1 and our prior year.
For Q2 working capital as a percentage of revenue was 14.6% a slight increase over the 14.3% in Q1.
We will continue to focus on cash conversion cycle and working capital trend improvements through operational and process efficiencies.
Now some more highlights related to cash flow results.
In the second quarter of 2015 our cash flow from operations was $56 million and our free cash flow was $27 million.
Capital expenditures were $29 million in the quarter.
More than 40% of the expenditures include what we call customer premise equipment for our payment as a service taxi and media businesses where we deploy products and systems at client locations that we expect to generate service revenues over many years.
In addition Q2 reflects capital investments related to our facilities and continued investments in our mission critical business infrastructure.
And lastly before I turn back over to Paul let me discuss our financial guidance.
For the full fiscal year 2015 we are taking up the lower end of our revenue guidance tightening the range to $1.995 billion to $2 billion which is approximately 6.7% growth over fiscal year 2014.
On a constant currency basis this reflects approximately 15% growth over last year.
For full fiscal year 2015 we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance $1.81 to $1.84 per share.
And for Q3 FY 2015 we’re guiding non-GAAP revenues in the range of $495 million to $500 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.44 to $0.46 per share.
Additionally we still expect fiscal year 2015 free cash flow generation to be approximately $140 million to $150 million.
Please refer to slide 20 of our earnings presentation for additional forward-looking financial information.
Thank you.
And with that let me now turn the call back to Paul before we open it up for questions.
Thanks Marc.
Before we move on to Q&amp;A I’d like to close our prepared remarks by really reemphasizing that certainly while we had a good quarter in Q2 we’re not yet done with our transformation.
Some parts of the business are performing at high levels and as you can see others are not yet.
But what’s important to recognize is that the plan that we laid out for you six quarters ago is working.
Our transformation is helping us to become more client focused and more nimble while improving our profitability.
We are building a world-class global product platform and we are doing great work for our clients and earning the trust of and the first call from superb companies such as Visa Chico’s Dunkin’ Gilbarco Google J.
Crew Microsoft Oracle and Westpac just to name a few.
So with that let’s go ahead and open it up to your questions.
Thank you.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Sounds like you’re making some great progress there.
I wonder if we could talk about the payments as a service business in a little bit of detail from a revenue model perspective it sounds like there are a number of different initiatives Paul I think I heard you talk about managed services gateway services security could you just describe a little bit how you think the revenue stream from your service initiatives evolves over time and what drives the reacceleration in that business to a level that satisfies you versus recent performance? The services business is a business that you know we really acquired a great portion of that business and then integrated.
The integration is now well underway.
So with that integration there are two key drivers of revenue growth.
One is if we take the clients that we have the thousands and thousands – hundreds of thousands of merchants that we provide services to and we bring new capabilities to that service offering and they pay a premium for those.
So that’s one major driver.
The second major driver really in the area of geographic expansion.
Now the problem with geographic expansion at least the way we used to do it is that every time we go into a country we build a brand new gateway or we’d acquire a gateway.
And that creates a real lack of scale they’re not cheap to operate if you’re just doing it for a country.
So we now have this global gateway infrastructure which we’ve invested a ton to build and that global gateway infrastructure is now being put into its first market and that’s going to be the basis on which you will see us get to geographic scale more quickly.
So those two are the main drivers.
The third thing that is really important is my example with Westpac.
More and more financial institutions whether they’re banks acquirers even some large merchants their issue today is that operating a terminal estate that is becoming more and more complex requiring more and more security encryption the ability to communicate with wallets the ability to encrypt on different types of transactions all of those things are immensely complicated.
And unless you have an entire department that is focused on that it’s becoming harder to you to stay at the leading edge and to give your consumers what they want.
So what we’re seeing and it’s really an important driver is that these financial institutions are coming to us and they are saying look I have 100 000 terminals I want you come in lift that up I want you to operate for us going forward and I want you to create magical experiences for consumers that are safe and sound.
That opportunity was not there two years ago.
So that is a major major thing for us.
And that’s an area where as we hit our stride we should really start to grow our services business much much more rapidly.
And then one follow-up.
There’s been a lot of talk about EMV cliff in the US particularly with regard to SMB merchants and the idea that there’s a massive pull forward this year which results in fiscal 2016.
How do you help us think about that in the context of the smoothness of your revenue performance particularly as we move toward petro EMV deadline? It’s a consistent theme to be short.
Obviously our performance in North America in Q2 was terrific and I can attribute a good portion of that certainly to EMV but not all of it.
The important thing is that as you look at the client base in the United States that is being impacted by liability shift it’s broken down into segments tier 1 mid-tier SMBs and then you got enterprise hospitality and you’ve got petro.
If you look at it holistically the total amount of payment terminals in the United States including Greenfield were at about 24% at the end of – right around the end of October 2014.
At the end of October 2014 in the US 24.4% of the terminals including Greenfield were EMV capable.
At the end of October 2015 we expect that number to be 40.7% roughly around 41%.
So there is another 60% to go.
And that 60% is not going to happen between now and October right.
That 60% is going to take over the next couple of years.
And then you’ve got the whole outdoor petrol stations which is another 1 million terminals virtually none of them are EMV capable today and that should take place in 2017.
So that one dimension gives us comfort that there is no as they say EMV cliff in the United States in 2015.
The last thing I would tell you is that you’re seeing Apple you’re seeing folks like Google you’re seeing people like Samsung they are all coming in and what they are basically saying is that the new operating system for a mobile device is going to include payments.
So the same way that it was originally engineered to make phone calls and then it went to text messages and email and browsing it’s now going to include payments.
Because of that these devices are going to have many more associated services with that than just the ability to accept the cards.
That too is going to play out big in the United States and that too is going to require us to continue to partner with acquirers and merchants in the United States certainly will beyond the EMV date.
I hope that helps.
Your next question comes from the line of S.
K.
Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs.
A couple if I may.
Probably to start off with Asia to what extent were you expecting this weakness in execution? And probably just a follow-up to that is when you took over controls six quarters back the visibility into the business especially from a revenue point of view was pretty low.
How has that improved over the quarters? And with regards to the revenues relatively talking in US to what extent are you in a position to predict that revenue cliff or revenue trajectory over the next few quarters? Let me start with Asia.
The answer is I knew that we were going to clearly be challenged in Asia based on all the time I spent there all the client conversations I’ve been having.
The issues in Asia are not a mystery to us we understand them deeply.
We also understand how to fix the root cause.
What we don’t have unfortunately the time machine to back in time and abate certain decisions.
Those decisions are being made now and we are executing and the issues that you see in Asia are temporary.
So Asia I can just tell you it’s an extraordinarily fast moving market and our clients in Asia really use criteria to you elevate RFPs in a very linear fashion.
So when they ask you for your ability to deliver an entire family of products and you don't show up with everything on game day you take your lumps.
And that’s what’s been happening to us in certain Asian markets.
The two areas where we have the most weakness in are in Indonesia where it was a whole combination of things.
I don’t think we had excellence in sales management and in sales process.
I also know that we had one major RFP in Indonesia and then they postponed the actual ordering of the products so we took our lumps there.
And there is clearly the need for us to build a winning franchise we’re working on that.
And in China I am really unhappy with how things turned out in China.
It was again pretty predictable in certain ways.
We have taken global product and we’ve tried to make global product work locally in China.
That worked for many years as you know we’re a leader.
We didn’t put it fast enough.
We didn’t embrace the fact that this is going to be the largest market and that we needed to manage that market fundamentally differently than the way we’ve been doing it.
We get that now.
We get that space and we’re working very hard.
We have been for a bunch of quarters by the way.
And the moves that we’ve made this quarter in particular the fact that we now have China reporting to me the fact that we’ve hired an ex terrific and very smart CEO of a major Chinese terminal manufacturer.
This guy is a real insider in the market knows everybody and everything he is now running our franchise and the fact that we’ve taken it upon ourselves and say we are going to develop manufacture distribute product differently in China than we do – than we have in the past.
All of those things I’m convinced very confident will fix our situation you will see us back in the game in China and certainly in Indonesia.
So hopefully that answers your question.
By the way the fact of the matter is can we have created more revenues in China absolutely.
We absolutely could have except it would have come at zero or lower margin.
And I for one I’m not interested in doing that kind of business.
So we could have posted great numbers on the revenue side we chose to run a business here and to run a sustainable business.
Second question was on visibility.
I’m going to turn that over to my partner Marc he can give you some insight on that and then I’m sure I’ll have some additional comments.
Marc? I would say that over the last year and a half the process in terms of planning and forecasting continued to mature.
I think we are much more coordinated team.
Our cadence our operating cadences are very much improving.
Our dash boarding and our view of backlog and booking trends is always front and center.
We definitely got surprised here with Asia as Paul has commented on in terms of the lack of execution fortunately in this quarter in particular the North American momentum continued significantly throughout the quarter and into the end of the third month there.
So certainly it was helpful.
But with respect to the other parts of the region very very predictable again very very good cadence amongst the management team here.
We track and we get into the details bottoms up on all of these businesses when the forecast our outlook.
Just one other question from my end from a capital allocation perspective you have achieved a great success in terms of reducing the debt levels and then you start thinking about alternate ways of capital allocation M&amp;A or something else where do your priorities lie and even in terms of acquisitions is it geographical focus or is it trying to acquire smaller merchant acquirer or smaller point of sale terminal guy so where are your priorities? Let me start with just a highlight again where we are in terms of leverage I gave you the numbers on cash and debt and what not but if you look at our trailing 12 month EBITDA related to our debt today we're at 2.6 times and that's we think a healthy place to be from a capital allocation perspective.
What this flexibility is giving us is the opportunity to do potential M&amp;A in the future you saw the small deal that we did last quarter GoPago DoubleBeam for $11 million.
I don't think we will be able to telegraph specifically in what regions and what technologies we are doing M&amp;A SK but we're certainly giving ourselves some more flexibility with our pay down of debt and improvement in terms of our leverage.
I would just say we’re pretty cautious pretty disciplined.
This capital that we have is real important and it needs to be deployed in a methodical way.
I mentioned gateways and I mentioned ecommerce and m-commerce our clients view us by and large as their terminal partner.
That relates almost entirely into what they do in the stores.
And we knew that that was a weakness.
We knew that we needed to offer omni-channel we knew we needed to have something valuable to provide them so that their consumers would get that kind of experience that they are becoming quite used to.
And so we looked at just about every asset you can imagine on the e-commerce and the m-commerce side.
And I could tell you that there were plenty available they trade at multiples of revenue they make very little money and the price tags are just astronomical.
And so what we decided to do is to get very creative very focused and I think the transaction that we’ve done now in partnership with Visa and CyberSource is what you can expect from this management team going forward.
We are not looking to buy revenue we’re not looking to do blunt object deals just because we can it doesn’t mean we won’t or we will.
So we view it as there is a gap either capability or geography we will be extraordinarily disciplined about build versus buy.
The thing I care most about is sustainability.
I want to make sure that whatever we do for our clients is a sustainable valuable thing that they compensate us for.
Away from that I think there are a lot of shiny objects.
Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.
I just want to start off when we look at your guidance for next quarter I think it shows on a reported basis 4% 5% but on a constant currency basis assuming a similar FX impact once again another quarter that would be around maybe 13% 14% against what’s a much tougher comp.
I think last year you grew constant currency around 17% or something along those lines – I’m sorry 14% in the third quarter versus 8% in the quarter you’re comping this quarter so inherent in that is some sort of acceleration in some of your businesses from what outside of Asia was obviously very strong.
Can you just comment on what you see in terms of acceleration? And then I just have a follow-up on the potential for each region for the remainder of the year how we should think about the way of each region’s growth? Let me start.
There is a lot of numbers in last year and this year but you are correct when we look at the guidance for Q3 the $495 million to $500 million on a constant currency basis that would be about 15% as well.
So full year about 15% now and Q3 would reflect the same.
There’s obviously the continued strength in North America.
But in Europe the base business continues to improve.
Both Paul and I highlighted the success in Western Europe despite some of those macro issues in FX we’re continuing to regain momentum across that continent.
So when we look at the numbers by segment on a constant currency basis the base business continues to do well.
And Latin America including the new leadership changes there and the improving relationships and the launch of VX 685 in Brazil momentum continues around many parts of that region again outside of FX.
So the base business continues to do well.
It’s absolutely benefiting from great tailwinds in North America but when you look across the other regions doing well as we’ve talked about Asia being the one area of difficulty that we are addressing particularly with the leadership changes.
So to summarize it sounds like based on the three segments that are non-Asia should be similar or better potentially in the next quarter? I would say that on a constant currency basis think about the numbers improving slightly or relatively comparable really across all segments including Asia.
Even with a tougher comp? I think this quarter for Asia was really – I’d call the bottom or close to it.
I mean just about everything went wrong that could go wrong in one quarter and we didn’t need it we knew it’s going to be tough and I’m real proud of the team because we kept the integrity of everything we did.
We didn’t flung and so when we do build back and you see the numbers come back they are high quality numbers they are business with margin and they’re from products that we’ve certified that really address what the clients have been telling us.
We wish to do it faster but it just takes a little bit more time.
Just a quick follow-up when we look at digging deeper in North America 50% plus growth and again we look at that holding up into even a tougher comp it's impressive when we look at the subsegment I think it was around 60% petro in the 20s and SMB around 50%.
When you look at those I mean SMB being 50% how much of that is actually EMV versus the new partner subsets someone like First Data or others that's actually sustainable just market share regains? I think for SMB you're right it's another great quarter two quarters in a row of 50% plus growth there and it's definitely a combination of two.
We had as I've been saying Paul and I have been saying the last couple of quarters we did not make the right investments in certifying our products the countertops and portables in particular across the acquiring space.
We're in a much much better competitive position today and that's paying off but I would say it's a balance between those two.
I think we repaired relationships that were deeply damaged.
That opened the door to have the real conversation upon certifying our products.
Certification takes time but with every single partner with whom we really wanted to be doing business with were now in that process.
So we were far from that 18 months ago.
Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.
Just on the Asia front you mentioned tender delays can you quantify that for us and do you have visibility into when those things will get shut in the second half? The tender delays for us the Asia comments were in greater Asia specifically Indonesia.
It was about let's say single million of dollars mid single millions during Q2 that got deferred into the second half of this year.
As Paul mentioned as well we've been awarded the business but there is some work to do relative to certification now to deliver that product and I would expect it later in the second half.
And then just the cost to get all of this fixed you both sound very confident that it was temporary so the cost to get it fixed how large could that be? I'm asking because I'm wondering if it's eating into some of the $10 million in incremental savings as you called out for example.
I think what we said as you know previously the restructuring and operational efficiency work we've been doing we quantified as north of $40 million savings and we still feel comfortable with that and certainly believe that there is more opportunities for efficiencies.
What we are starting to do now in our planning process is determining how much of that we should reinvest back into strategic areas.
So start to fix and move away from what you call business as usual get the efficiencies there and make investment capital allocations for the strategic growth areas and will report back on that to you in the coming quarters.
But as it relates to fixing China itself how large is that investment potentially? I think it's well baked into the outlook except the OpEx just fractional for the second half of the year and it reflects the work we need to do but it's several millions of dollars Tien-Tsin it's not at this point beyond that.
Again I want to make sure that everybody understands that it's not like we just figured out this problem in Q2 and are just now starting to plan to fix them.
We've known this problem I think I've been talking about it for six straight quarters and we have continued to make the necessary investments all along.
It takes time to find the right person we found that person.
It takes time to engage with very large scale type of technology firms to do strategic partnerships we've now done that.
And most importantly it takes time to certify the full family of products.
And in China you could show up that you could have the best terminal let's call it a countertop but that includes portables and they also want MPOS and you don't have it you're just not in the game.
They don't want to talk to you.
They expect you to come with the full family we did not have that.
And we've been aware that we don't have that.
So that's coming but it's painful that it isn't here already it just takes time.
I just want to add just one more comment on China cost the other thing that we are doing and I think will be really effective both from a quality and time to market and a cost perspective de-risking is the ODM JDM relationships that Paul outlined.
So we are in the process of completing our deal with are very very important strategic partner in China that has scale and experience that will do a much better job leveraging together versus doing it on our own.
Okay.
Yes.
That was my follow-up.
I won't hog the call thanks for the time.
Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.
Paul a question for you.
You pointed to the success of the mobile products starting out.
As you look at your mobile product portfolio and how you expect retailers to use that over the coming years is there a chance of cannibalization that the mobile products will take over for some of the countertop units? And if they do what's the price point differential and how should we think about that going forward? We don't see the cannibalization effect.
Mobile point of sale has really filled an important gap where you have either an established merchant with a terminal estate [indiscernible] or better engagement experience the consumers they are not going to get rid of their fixed line terminals.
In fact what we've seen from many that they are adding kiosk terminals and they are adding the mobile point of sale.
In the grand scheme of things it's not that much of a large investment.
So they are willing to do that and we are seeing them saying look in every store we want at least three of these units where at busy times somebody can grab hold of it and engage with the consumer.
And by the way that's before we get all these gateways to talk and create those magical experience.
So that's one area.
It's definitely not in any way say cannibalizing it.
The second is you have all of these segments of clients that never had terminals.
And now they are considering it.
And they are looking at it and they are saying I think I can do as well with a smaller device than going to something that including the cash register and include the terminals.
And in their particular circumstance it may make perfect sense.
It may make perfect sense because they don't have the legacy systems that do the rest of the things beyond just accepting the card.
So those are net new customers I call them Greenfield.
And then you've got the tier 5 guys which they never accepted cards they accept two or three card payments a month they don't need anything other than a very simple mobile terminal.
So we see that as growth opportunities.
I should also add that in certain markets call it India call it Brazil some of the rising markets we're talking about millions of these units millions of devices not 100 000.
And for that market you need certain elements not just the product but in the service that you offer with a product and I'm quite optimistic about what my product management team has on the drawing board and has in prototype and in certification.
I think that will play out very well for us.
As a follow-up to that I think it was interesting your comments you noted 13 of those Greenfield investments coming into play this quarter.
As you look at the tier 1 and tier 2 retailers how many retailers are still yet to go in terms of needing to replace with terminals they haven't previously had before? I'm not sure I understand the question Keith.
Can you repeat that maybe reframe it a little? Yes.
Just I mean there's 200 of the top retailers out there is there still are there 20 or 30 of those that are still not using a VeriFone type terminal but still using perhaps point of sale device or keyboards? There are some that are still holdouts I think that they will convert or they are in the process of converting.
By the end of October of this year we will have 90% out of the total 1.8 million lanes at the top 200 retailers operate they will all be EMV enabled.
The remaining 10% I would imagine between October and the first quarter of 2016.
And some of them are just – a lot of these folks are really quite sophisticated in terms of payments beyond operating the retail.
They've made a the decision and I agree with it.
In fact I totally agree with that.
They made a decision that the most important thing is to encrypt even more than anything else they need to encrypt whatever touches their payment devices whether it's a terminal or a card reader or a keyboard or whatever you have it's that encryption and then getting it out of their data centers and into the acquirer that is the key to preventing that headline risk that is so troublesome.
And so when they have to make a choice do I get encryption to work first or do I work on EMV the vast majority of them go to encryption first and then they employ EMV.
And so that's why you have not 100%.
Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.
So very strong North American results great job there.
It feels like rest of world is on the verge of turning if it's not we've already seen signs in EMEA and it sounds like there's other data points to look forward to.
So I'm wondering the question is when do we start seeing more positive financial operating leverage in the sales and marketing and G&amp;A lines? How should we think about that as the top line continues to perform well versus what operating expenses are? I think we got a little bit of deleverage I know we did this quarter with the results that we got 19% improvement year-on-year in terms of earnings per share and I do believe that there will be lasted in terms of leveraging our cost of infrastructure as we progress into 2016.
And I will be prepared certainly when we release our Q4 to provide that color in terms of OpEx again as a percentage of sales.
To be frank I'm equally excited about what we're doing in the supply chain particularly in the system solutions business.
I believe it's an end to end optimization transformation.
Paul talked about the leadership changes we've made there in the last year or so.
And from a platform that we have as an example 1000 suppliers we intend to take that number down materially over the next 12 months and we are doing a lot of work in general around our procurement processes and I think that is more leverage to be had on that front.
So this year there is absolutely transformation still in process two thirds of the way through that bubble in terms of R&amp;D investments to consolidate the platform work going on in shared services and tend to certainly focus on getting leverage off of those programs as we progress out of the year.
But as I said I'm equally if not more excited about the work that we're doing on the supply chain optimization.
And I appreciate that direction very much.
Is there any way to provide the goal here how much more lemon juice can you squeeze out of the supply chain lemon so to speak? And what do you guys expect to achieve over the next year from those programs? If you would allow me Paul here to provide that color as we progress into the second half of the year we will be doing that.
Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria with Wedbush Securities.
One another follow-up on EMV and NFC.
So first on EMV the numbers you talked about the 24% and the 41% end of 2014 to end of 2015 that sounds a lot like the numbers you talked about last time and then the time before that.
Does that mean that the EMV cycle is happening as you thought it would or is there more pull forward or push out than you did three or six months ago? No it's actually following and tracking pretty well.
I am little surprised to be honest with you I would have imagined that we would have had a bit more variability but clients in each of the segments are by and large behaving in a similar way.
Their prioritization of what they do is remarkably similar.
They are working with a handful of acquirers obviously you get a lot of merchants from just four or five acquirers and so we are seeing this rollout kind of the way we talked about in the last couple of quarters.
When we were originally wrote these numbers I was a little bit unsure about sharing them with you.
Obviously North America SMB and I said this last quarter they did accelerate faster than we had originally thought.
But overall if you look at all 13 million or so including Greenfield it's moving as we expected.
And then you mentioned the positive impact of the pull from Apple Pay in the US and then now possibly Android Pay how about when those platforms go internationally later this year and into next year into places that don't – that aren't already buying an EMV terminal because they already have one but don't have NFC.
Do you expect that as Android Pay Apple Pay other NFC based wallets go globally they'll pull some – they will create some new demand outside the US for NFC-enabled terminals or NFC upgrades to existing terminal? Let me tell you a couple of things.
One is that in our Europe business as an example in Q2 about 93% of all the terminals we sold came with NFC versus about 87% in the first quarter.
You heard MasterCard coming out earlier this year saying that new installations of terminals must support NFC after January 1 2016 and infield terminals out by 2020.
So you are hearing the networks certainly talk to the fact that they support this NFC thing they think it's a good thing.
A lot of them issue cards with NFC chips.
And so even if there isn't the wallet consumers find it very convenient to just have their NFC card.
If you talk to the quick service restaurants in the United States they would love that because there is concern for them that an EMV card takes a bit longer to process than a traditional magnetic stripe card.
So I can see that there are good use cases and I could see that people are pushing forward on that.
In the US NFC sales in Q2 about 80% of the terminals we sold in Q2 had NFC about 74% were there in Q1.
So that's sort of moving.
The big opportunity in the US for us working with merchants is that a fewer of those NFC devices are turned on.
They are able to access that NFC chip but the software work has not turned on those devices.
So Apple Pay Android Pay Samsung Pay and everyone else starts to bring value we could see that there is an opportunity for those to be turned on.
As far as the rest of the world is concerned it's a little bit of a mixed bag.
You've got certain countries that have extensive NFC there are certain countries that don't have very much at all.
And if these wallets and if NFC touch cards become what many hope they will it will provide a really nice wind on our back for years to come.
I think we got time for one or two more.
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.
Just looking at Latin America that growth was down I think on a constant currency basis I think it was minus 6% or so and I know it was up 15% before.
Just the impact there was that just all in the Brazilian market and just exactly what happened there? I’ll give you a color Bryan thanks for the question.
I’ll give you a little bit more color on Latin America.
Again from a forecasting perspective it was in line with our expectations.
I didn't comment in my script here on Mexico Mexico continues to be very strong and if you look at Mexico results in Q2 versus Q1 nicely improved.
Brazil was a little bit more challenging although constant currency affected it was much more comparable.
The VX 685 launched in Q2 that's our new design on the portable terminal and we were able to ship that in to two acquirers.
It was pretty small volume I expect that to ramp into Q3 and Q4 but that's probably the major color I would provide it would be on Mexico and Brazil.
I would just say Bryan that our Latin American business you look at it over the years it can be a bit lumpy at times.
It's not really much more than that of an explanation just not that lumpy for us in Q2.
Had we had those devices certified earlier it would have been better.
But they are now up and running so I do expect as Marc said I already know that I've got a nice pipeline of orders I shared some of that with you in my prepared remarks.
So I think that the region is doing fine and I'm really delighted to have Carlos in the sea he is Brazilian he and I worked together this guy really understands that market inside out we've had great relationships there.
And I think he is going to bring a lot of discipline in the sales process.
I'm trying to shift as much of our business away from box shipping and so if you notice a lot of the folks that I'm bringing in have a lot of services experience as well as understanding the hardware and the specific nuances of the terminal business.
And then on the flip side it looked like the EMEA accelerated; I think it was 4% up towards 8%.
It sounds like Western Europe is there anything in particular that was happening in Europe that drove a little bit of an acceleration? I would say it was across Western Europe.
When we look at it at constant currency basis really across most of the Western European countries France Germany was a good quarter Poland Nordics there was some growth in the Nordics region but it was as you know part of our payment as a service business that was a little bit less there.
The area where we didn't grow as well in fact we were down year-on-year was really in the broader Middle East Africa region.
And when we put Russia in there we had some significant declines.
But when you look across the Western European footprint really across the board there was really good market penetration and market share gains.
Just last question from me.
Paul you mentioned that you could have driven higher revenue growth rates in Asia but would have came at lower profitability.
Is that due to just some irrational behavior in the market and how people are pricing in Asia? I don't think so.
I think they are pretty rational.
I just think they are really good at what they do and they've gotten it down to where very very barebones.
They are doing things completely on the ground.
They are getting a China brand you're getting China manufacturing China engineering and [indiscernible] and that's what they are willing to pay for.
They are not willing to pay for more than that.
So it is what it is I'm not good at storytelling excuses we didn't show up on game there with the game ball and we got our heads handed to us.
That's what it is.
And it's not going to happen again we got it but I would tell you it really [sucked].
Whitley we have time for one more question please.
Your final question comes from the line of John Williams with Topeka.
I just had a really quick question.
So you have talked a bit in the past about your strategy in China and I just want to get a little bit of color.
It seemed like you might have been thinking about potentially doing acquisitions and just in terms of signaling it sounds as though you're not necessarily going that direction or at least in any significant way in China.
I just want to confirm that that's the case and then secondly how long you think it'll take to really improve in that market? It's a really hard question to answer.
So it certainly looked at assets in China we will always look at assets in China just like we do in every market.
The Chinese market is pretty right now and things are valued in a way that I can't get my head around.
It's not to say that they are not valuable by the way it's just I can't make the numbers work.
So we will continue to look but we are not going to need it we're going to make steady progress every month.
We have a combination of the right person running the franchise on a go forward basis.
To me that's 90% of what you need it is the right person the right leadership.
Then we have this paradigms shifting partnership with this particular top five engineering design manufacturing firms which really rides the consumer curve and part of that comes from the fact that we brought in a terminal solutions head who I mentioned in the past who has worked on very large scale consumer electronics deployment.
He is bringing a level of sophistication to just about everything we do on the massive and he really sees this as an important way to differentiate our company.
As we continue to make progress I will absolutely look at services businesses I will look at technology I will look at everything.
But the easiest thing to do is to overpay and I'm just not there.
And one other question and Marc you alluded to this before when you were talking about the longer-term OpEx side of the business but I know you had mentioned in the past that you were expecting I think it was $30 million or $40 million or so that would drop off potentially next year after the reinvestment.
And just given the LatAm and China changes that you are making do you expect that that should still happen or should we rethink our OpEx model for next year? We expect to drive additional operating expense as a percentage of revenue efficiency into the ongoing results.
With respect to the $30 million to $40 million savings we've definitely reinvested part of that back into the strategic initiatives in both payment as a service and commerce some of that will definitely flow into direct savings in 2016.
I'll be in a better position to give you those numbers probably in Q4.
But in terms of some initial modeling we would certainly expect to drive OpEx as a percentage of sales down further this year.
I thought it would be about 100 basis points it's probably closer to 80 bps.
So you can count on us to take some of those efficiencies in but I wouldn't put a bracket around $30 million to $40 million at this point yet John.
Well I want to thank everybody for taking the time and your continued interest in our company.
We really appreciate it.
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the VeriFone Systems Incorporated Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Paul Galant CEO of VeriFone.
Thank you Doug and thank you all for joining us today.
I am pleased to report that we are successfully executing the plan that we set this year and the results are strong and continue to [speak] the results.
Based on feedback from prior earnings calls we are going to shorten our prepared remarks today to lead more time for your questions.
To this end I am going to briefly provide business highlights and also discuss what VeriFone is doing to drive growth well beyond FY15.
I will then turn the call over to Marc.
So let me begin with our financial highlights.
We posted record revenue in Q3 of $510 million.
It was the first $0.5 billion quarter in VeriFone’s 30 plus year history.
We achieved this record result because our clients awarded us more business and a greater share of their wallet than in any time in recent history.
We delivered the 510 million despite continued strong FX headwinds and many challenged economies in key markets.
We did it despite only just now beginning to deliver our next-generation mobile solutions and not yet having released our next-generation VeriFone engage devices not yet having launched our full China product portfolio and only very recently starting to deliver the new payment and commerce services we have been building during the past year.
And we delivered this record organic quarter without the benefit of acquisitions.
It was done fully organically.
Our year-over-year constant currency growth in Q3 was 18% ahead of our projections and ahead of the industry.
We're winning client business and market share and are growing our revenues while also improving our operations and our time to market and as a result our earnings as well.
Our earnings per share grew 18% over last year.
Compare that to our as reported revenue growth rate at 7% and you will see that our profitability and our operating leverage are improving.
We achieved this despite continuing through investment in our transformation our 2015 year product roadmap and our next chapter strategy.
All of these investments are critical and necessary as we reposition the company for growth.
In Q3 we grew our North America business by 61% year-over-year and are launching new products and new services that will drive sustainable North America revenue growth in the coming quarters.
We are collaborating with our client beyond just terminals.
We're growing our market share services and expanding our stock-base of connected devices.
We are increasingly getting the first call from acquirers merchants banks and distributors to trust VeriFone and want our solutions to help them with payment security mobile wallets alternative payment acceptance loyalty Omni-channel solutions beacon networks and other capabilities that are rapidly defining the future of payments and commerce well beyond just EMV.
In Europe we saw double-digit constant currency revenue gains in six large countries.
Much of the North America VeriFone is gaining client momentum.
One excellent example is in Spain where we won a major piece of business with El Corte Inglese one of the country's largest retailers on the first ever installed of our MX 925 multimedia devices in that market.
In Asia we grew our business by 11% over Q2 and in China we're building a strong local management product and engineering team.
These folks are wasting no time with bringing a full product portfolio to market.
I have to report that just a few weeks ago VeriFone's China entity achieved a new mandatory security certification one of the few -- one of the first foreign companies to do that [indiscernible].
This certification allows us to sell our full product suite end-to-end which we will launch in the second half of FY'16 to all Chinese institutions.
Although we have some weeks to go I am confident in VeriFone's long-term success in China.
And in Latin America we improved 8% sequentially and drilled strong growth results in many markets in that region.
By nearly every available operational and financial metric we exceeded our year-to-date plans and our expectations.
We won mission-critical client deals and captured many Greenfield opportunities.
As I've said in the past two earnings call VeriFone is not the same company it was two years ago.
We've come a long way and the best is yet to come.
Let me spend just a few minutes recapping what is different about VeriFone today.
We made significant progress in fixing our foundation; you can see the progress we've made through Q3 of this year on Slide 6.
We are moving faster and communicating better we're more efficient and are producing higher quality products and services.
And we're evolving our business from mostly periodic sales of single-purpose payment terminals to a more balanced model in which VeriFone earns annuity revenues by delivering services that help our clients reduce the risk and complexity inherent in managing payments while at the same time helping them to grow sales in digital media Omni-channel and in-store commerce enablement solutions.
These aren’t just bullets in a PowerPoint.
The team here has been consistently executing on this for the past few years.
Our clients see the progress and they are excited for the new products and services we will deliver to them starting in the fourth quarter of this year.
I would like to talk just a bit about these new solutions and how they will help us to drive growth in 2016 and beyond.
First we will continue to capitalize on EMV in the United States.
We strongly believe that there is no 2016 North America revenue cliff from EMV.
Despite the fact that some of the investment communities believe that North America will be down in revenues in 2016 due to a tough 2015 comp in tier 1 retail based on our current pipeline of 2016 EMV solutions and our business development activities we expect to generate more revenues in North America in 2016 than we will in 2015.
Based on our current projections we see growth of approximately 3% in North America revenue in 2016 on a much much larger base.
We are in year one of a significant upgrade cycle that we expect to last for at least another two to three years as middle market retailers small and medium businesses and hospitality businesses either upgrade their existing payment infrastructure or adopt consumer facing devices for the first time.
Beyond upgrading existing terminals VeriFone has done an excellent job of going after greenfield opportunities in segments such as hospitality and restaurants.
We were awarded 17 such greenfield deals in the quarter beating all of our competitors.
With new clients by the way such as [5 Guys] [Great Burgers] and many of these were won through our partnerships including those with NCR Oracle Retail and Microsoft.
Also EMV migration in the US petroleum industry is a significant opportunity from which we expect to generate at least approximately $50 million in incremental revenue in FY16.
Clients require a complete infrastructure refresh including new consumer facing devices point of sale systems and site controllers inside the convenience store and this will drive this demand for our jointly developed forecourt payment and media solution with our partners at Gilbarco Veeder-Root.
Petroleum as an example of where VeriFone has a solid product suite lots of innovation in services and has aligned with a great partner and is better positioned than any of our competitors to capitalize on this opportunity.
A lot of this revenue is services annuity revenues.
This fall we will launch VeriFone [Engage] our new device platform with unprecedented two-way communication capabilities.
[Engage] will be in pilot this quarter and begin to ship in early FY16.
It will not only generate additional terminal revenue next year but also is a launching pad for VeriFone's commerce enablement services.
In mPOS interesting client demand in this area has grown substantially for several years.
I think as you all know we at VeriFone have not had the complete product suite in this area it's one of the first things that I realized when I came into the company that we didn’t have our act together.
Well that has changed.
Our new family of mobile devices including the groundbreaking e355 will begin to ship this month.
We have already signed deal with one of the top four US wireless carriers deploy it in all of their retail stores.
The pipeline of demand grew significantly in the quarter and we will soon introduce lower cost bearing for this technology for mid tier merchants and for the general emerging market space.
We expect our new mPOS solutions to generate at least $35 million in incremental global revenue in FY16.
In Q3 we launched our new global payment gateway in its first market Mexico and are now beginning implementation into the United States.
VeriFone will continue to roll out emphasis of this new infrastructure which creates significant scale and economics for us in our largest markets as measured by client demand.
Beyond gateways our state management solution VHQ is moving closer to global scale and we signed more than 25 additional deals for our secured commerce architecture or SCA in the quarter with commitments to connect up to an additional 20 000 new devices bringing the number of committed devices year-to-date to 220 000.
But we are not just connecting merchants' physical commerce infrastructure to the VeriFone cloud.
We are actively working with Visa and CyberSource to launch a bank-grade globally scaled omni-channel solution for merchants for banks acquirers and service providers.
VeriFone has engaged with a number of CyberSource clients and has begun corresponding and responding to very large RFIs with joint VefiFone CyberSource solutions.
We expect to commence formal joint marketing this quarter and to begin onboarding merchants in early FY'16.
We already have a significant pipeline of deals building with our partners in CyberSource.
And the final piece of our services strategy and execution plan is to deliver applications to these connected devices so that merchants can secure their payment operations in a better way and leverage VeriFone technology to engage with their consumers.
We’re in development of solutions as you know such as media on terminal pay with points across all financial networks [indiscernible] offers and many other commerce enabling applications.
Early next year we’ll launch our app to marketplace.
The marketplace will be opened to developers and we expect adoption to ramp throughout 2016 with almost 27.5 million devices in the field we should provide for a very powerful platform for the developing community I know they have interest in it.
Look as you can see there is a lot of opportunity for VeriFone in 2016 and beyond and we’re genuinely excited about that.
We’re excited because we’re growing our business and taking shares and disciplined execution and a client first mentality.
We’re excited because of transformation has really positioned us to become a company that is moving beyond just shipping boxes to one that also provides our clients with the comprehensive solutions encompassing many products and services.
And we’re excited about to lead forward we’ll take as our next generation of VeriFone solutions come to market.
With that I'll turn the call over to my partner our CFO Mark Rothman.
Mark? Thank you Paul.
Consistent with past practice we’ll be referring to certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis.
For the third quarter we exceeded overall financial expectations.
We've reported record net revenues of $510 million compared to guidance of 495 million to 500 million and revenues increased 7% from a year-ago and excluding the impact of foreign exchange growth was 18% on a constant currency basis.
Earnings per share of $0.47 also exceeded guidance of $0.44 to $0.46 and this compared EPS last quarter of $0.44 and $0.40 a year-ago.
Let me now discuss results by region.
In North America we generated record revenues of 209 million representing 8% growth sequentially and 61% growth year-over-year.
Our North American multi land retail group delivered excellent results slightly up from the prior quarter and up significantly again from last year.
The EMP related liability shift the need for end-to-end security solutions and our recently launched mobility products were all key drivers.
Our U.S.
petrol business delivered sequential growth as well and significant growth from a year-ago.
Our next generation products for convenience stores including sight controllers and POS systems are competing very well at this time when convenience stores are upgrading for EMV.
We believe we’re gaining market share with larger major petroleum accounts as well as independent operators.
We expect continued momentum in this vertical as we ramp up activity with our strategic partner [indiscernible].
In our small and medium business vertical we delivered sequential improvement and significant growth on a year-over-year basis.
We continue to deliver strong revenues driven by high demand for EMV ready solutions for this channel and the addition of newly certified products to the market.
And finally in North America net revenues in our taxi payment and media businesses were up both sequentially and year-over-year.
We continue to see increases in taxi transaction revenues as we've expanded our fleet footprint and more passengers pay with credit cards instead of cash.
Media revenues also continue to grow both at the gas pump and in the convenient store.
Our network of connected consumer facing screens continues to scale attracting increased interest from advertisers.
In Latin America revenues were $74 million up 8% sequentially and down 17% year-over-year.
In constant currency terms revenues were up 13% sequentially and comparable with the prior year.
In Brazil we delivered our newly designed VX 685 portable terminals in the market and continued to strengthen relationships throughout the region.
In Europe Middle East and Africa revenues of $173 million were down 4% sequentially and 9% from the prior year reflecting foreign exchange headwinds as well as lower sales in both Russia and Nigeria.
More importantly revenues were up 5% on a constant currency basis and we continue to improve our market share in Western Europe where we reported double-digit year-over-year revenue increase on a constant currency basis.
And in Asia revenues of 55 million were up 11% sequentially down 18% from the prior year and down 8% on a constant currency basis as expected.
These year-over-year declines occurred primarily in China and Indonesia.
Our Australia New Zealand businesses [indiscernible] segment and grew significantly on a sequential basis as we make excellent progress on products and service deployment with and the rollout of solutions across these two countries.
We are pleased with our sequential improvement and very optimistic about our longer term opportunities in these important markets.
Now let’s discuss results by product line.
Q3 revenues for system solutions were $333 million up 11% year-on-year and up 20% on a constant currency basis.
We continued to build momentum across this product line as we deploy new products globally and benefit from EMV mobility and petro overlaps.
Service revenues were $177 million comparable year-over-year and up 7%.
On a constant currency basis year-over-year revenue growth was 13%.
We saw continued growth in payment at the service as well as strengthen both taxi and media.
Turning now to gross margin results.
Consolidated gross margin was 41.7% down 110 basis points sequentially and comparable with the year ago.
For system solutions hardware gross margin was 41.1% of revenue compared to 43.1% last quarter reflecting in part higher than expected warranty related charges during the period.
These are non-recurring product charges that have been remedied and we expect continued gross margin improvements as we deliver new products and continue to enhance our global supply chain activities.
Service gross margins of 42.9% were up 80 basis points compared to the prior quarter reflecting leverage from [high rate] taxi and media revenues.
Q3 consolidated operating expenses were at $141 million comparable with Q2 and reflect additional investment R&amp;D with an offsetting decrease in SG&amp;A.
Also of note we announced new restructuring plan and reported a GAAP charges of $6 million in Q3.
We expect the total plans to cost approximately 10 million and intend to reinvest a substantial portion of the savings from these actions to fund strategic business initiatives.
We are absolutely focused on operational efficiencies and will provide further OpEx and other financial guidance in December.
Our capital structure we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $242 million gross debt of 814 million and net debt of $572 million.
Gross debt reflects a repayment of $30 million during the quarter.
We also are pleased to report back in June Standards and Poor's rating services raised our corporate credit rating from BB minus to BB with a stable outlook.
Now we would like to discuss working capital metrics.
Accounts receivable decreased to $322 million and receivable days sales outstanding improved to 57 days from 60 days last quarter due to improved collections and continued focus on sales linearity.
Inventory decreased to $122 million from a $129 million last quarter and inventory days outstanding of 38 days were 5 days better than Q2.
Accounts payable under the quarter at $150 million representing a decrease in days payble of 10 days to 45 days which correlates with general timing of inventory purchases as well as timing of payments to vendors.
An overall cash conversion cycle was 49 days in Q3 which was relatively comparable to both Q2 and the year ago.
For Q3 working capital as a percentage of revenue was 14.4% a slight improvement of the 14.6% in Q2.
We continue to focus on cash conversion cycle and working capital trend improvements through both operational and process efficiencies.
Now some highlights on cash flow.
The third quarter 2015 cash flow from operations was $71 million and free cash flow was $42 million.
Both cash flow metrics reflects our best quarterly performance in the last three years.
Capital expenditures were $30 million in the quarter more than 40% of these expenditures include customer [promised] equipment for our payments and service taxi and media businesses where we deployed products and systems that are connected to our infrastructure and generate future service revenues.
And lastly let me discuss financial guidance.
For the fiscal year 2015 were guiding revenues to $1.997 billion to $2 billion which is approximately 7% growth over FY14 on a constant currency basis this reflects approximately 15% organic growth over last year and is consistent with prior guidance.
For fiscal year 2015 our non-GAAP EPS guidance was a $1.82 to a $1.83 per share.
And for Q4 we are guiding non-GAAP revenues in the range of $510 million to $513 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.47 to $0.48 per share.
Additionally we expect fiscal year 2015 free cash flow generation to be approximately $140 million.
Please refer to slide 17 of our earnings presentation for additional forward-looking financial information.
And lastly beyond the early North American revenue growth guidance provided we will provide broader fiscal year 2016 guidance on December earnings call.
Once again we are very pleased with our continued progress and our overall financial performance.
Thank you and with that let us now open the call to your questions.
Nicole? Thank you.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital.
Your line is now open.
Great guys thanks a lot and thanks for the incremental color on 2016 outlook for North America.
Obviously it is on a lot of people's minds.
Just on that just to give a little more granularity on it it sounds like you are discussing obviously continued strength coming still from carry over on EMV.
But can you just give us a little more color? You mentioned petrol could be incremental I think you said $50 million mPOS $30million.
Is that also assuming small merchant categories still relatively early in early days in that upgrade and that that's going to drive a lot more in the 2016 year? And maybe a little more on the increase in the addressable market I think you mentioned 17 wins you saw coming I guess.
Darren it's Paul thank you for that question appreciate it.
The EMV conversation has been in the market for a while and I guess people talk about a cliff.
I'm not sure what a cliff is.
We expect more revenue in North America in 2016 than we booked in 2015 that's not a cliff to me.
Where that's coming from really four places.
Number one 8 million terminals in the market still need to be upgraded.
So 60% of the US terminal base after October 15th will not yet have been upgraded.
There're 7 million or so in the small to business and mid-tier states of which 2 million by the way are greenfield so five currently have terminals two don't seven together.
About a million in hospitality.
All that's greenfield by and large.
So all of that has to be done.
That's going to take in my opinion based on what we've seen at least two years.
Petrol is a whole other category and we're seeing a pretty aggressive start in dialogue and plans and execution and we're going to really see the revenue start to come in in 2016 I think there's at least 50 million of incremental petrol revenue in FY '16.
The opportunity is from a million terminals which today are not EMV capable there's the ones that you use in the pumps.
By the way the [indiscernible] share of these million terminals I expect to be at least 500 000 about half and by the way every time we upgrade one of these EMV devices in the pump by and large we're also going to include a media platform that's going to drive annuity media revenue.
As you also know the convenience stores require new POS new POS systems in addition to just the terminals of the but the terminals are by and large done but the POS system the actual cash register and the site controllers most of them were not done and in order for EMV to work they all need to be upgraded.
mPOS I mentioned that's the third area of growth for us we did not have because the company didn't invest we did not have a full suite of mPOS terminals.
mPOS is one of the big growth drivers of 2015 you saw it in places like Brazil.
You saw it in the US you saw it in lots of places.
We did not have the right product set that's changed.
We don't have the full product suite and we see this as an incredibly important opportunity for us not just in the United States but globally as merchants want to compete with the likes of Amazon right they want to supplement their salespeople to have the salesperson have more information in their hands and also to do line busting.
We're just entering this field with the full suite.
We got E355 available this month wasn't available in August it is available this month and we're rolling it out competitors I think have been growing from this area for a long time now it's our turn.
And we're not and the fourth area is we're not just building terminals.
We're really building a network.
We're connecting those terminals we got payment as a service [indiscernible] gateways FDA we've got [estate] management encryption right so all of this is why I feel that there is no EMV cliff I feel that North America is going to have a pretty good year in 2016.
All right that's very helpful.
Can I ask one follow up quickly on it sounds like that's encouraging it sounds like multi-years of elevated revenue in North America.
Just one follow up Mark did you mention on the margin side that there was a somewhat of a onetime non-recurring item impacting the gross margin on the price thought I heard you say something around products orders.
When I reviewed the margin performance for the company I mentioned in systems solutions where we had 41.1% margins in the next quarter that it was down and it was driven primarily by a warranty claim that we took during this period and just to give you a little color behind it because it really is non-recurring in nature it happened and a production issue about a year ago and it became an issue to one of our clients in Q3 and of course we left it to rapidly remedy the situation as we did and it's been recaused and proper corrective actions have been taken on the product so one time but these quality spills do happen from time to time.
Fortunately for VeriFone they have been very-very limited and we've implemented a number of processes to ensure that this is minimized so it doesn't happen in the future.
All right so I'll leave at this and return to the queue but all in margin expansion you had expected as a company over the next couple of years to show extension perhaps as we creep closer to your closest competitor.
That's still very much on the table even through these lifted revenue numbers.
It was a little fuzzy but let me see if I got this one here I missed part of the question but in generally Paul and I both believe that we’re progressing in the right direction for margin expansion across both of our product categories and in system solutions in particular on the hardware there will be certainly opportunity as we launch VeriFone Engage.
But we’re not waiting for VeriFone Engage to drive those margins north to a more competitive level.
There is a lot going on to completely optimize supply chain I’ve talked about that we’ve made continuous progress and I think there is more to come in terms of procurements.
We are taking a very very hard look and new look at logistics and warehouse and in call centers globally and let's say at this way the supply chain they are not going to get a sleep lately.
Okay guys.
That’s great and nice job.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.
Your line is now open.
Thanks guys.
I just had a question about the Q4 outlook because it seems like there is really some underlying momentum here in the business that Q4 is on for basically flat quarter-over-quarter revenue and EPS.
So what are some of the factors holding back sequential growth because it doesn’t seem like you're baking any incremental FX into the guide if I heard your comments -- prepared remarks correctly? Thank you Jason.
The guidance is slightly up on the high end but true it is 5.10 million to 5.13 million in revenue of the 5.10 print in Q3 and we’re guiding EPS $0.47 to $0.48 per share in Q4.
And just for geographic color we are assuming that placed upon our backlog and our roll [offset] they will be relatively comparable period-to-period.
So we had guidance a little bit less in Q3 and some good things happen so that time your revenue came in Q3.
So for the full year Paul and I still comfortable with the prior guidance that we provided and maybe Q4 is a little bit more balance than what we see right now Jason.
I would just -- let me throw some things to consider here we’ve been in a period forever of high commodity prices weak U.S.
dollar and the emerging market is booming like mad.
It just feels like the world has changed a bit and leaning in at this point where we see a lot of the emerging markets just not having the same level of momentum.
We just don’t think it's the right message internally or externally.
My focus is to fix the company the company needs to be fixed we need to invest in the new products we are here to manage a company and we’re here to manage it right and we’re not going to pull back on the investments that we need to make.
It's because of people chasing things in prior years that we got ourselves into a load of trouble we’re not doing that again under any circumstances.
We’re going to have the best products we’re client first company we see the world well beyond terminal solutions and as you all know that takes investments and technology companies need to have appropriate level of R&amp;D spend and we need to be able to support our clients because they are going through a really tough time right now.
You're a retailer you got a lot of things that you got to consider.
And so we’re doing this in a way that we feel is right for our clients right for companies right for the shareholder.
Okay so it sounds like a little macro conservatism baked into the guidance which does seem prudent obviously [indiscernible] on the wall right now.
Just a follow-up question I know last quarter you talked about and I think it was $6 million order out of Indonesia that have been pushed into the second half did that get booked in Q3 or you're looking for that in Q4? We had a little bit better business in Indonesia Jason in Q3 and we won one particular award.
But what I commented last quarter with respect to Indonesia is expected more towards the middle part of this current quarter.
So start to see a little improvement in that particular country inside the Asia region and I think VeriFone is positioned to take its fair share.
Okay.
Thank you guys.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.
Your line is now open.
Hello thanks this is Osugova Freshmarie.
I just wanted to ask a quick question on the mobility products that you just talked about I guess we’re seeing a lot of promotion acquires get into the [indiscernible] as well and historically you guys have used that channel to distribute into the SMB segment.
So can you talk about how your distribution strategy is evolving or adapting and how you think about your competitive positioning in the SMB segment? Sure I would be happy to so mobility as I mentioned we completely overhauled our mobile product fleet just we didn’t have the right product it was obvious.
We developed a new strategy and roadmap at the beginning of 2015 products take a bit of a time to develop and get certifications and so I'm happy to report that we're in a really good spot now.
We've got the full range of mobile terminal offerings really we've put -- we built these things thinking holistically about software and hardware as opposed to just as be hardware and develop the software for it.
But we did that because we have tier 1 clients who want to use these products for a line busting these products have to connect to their existing ecosystem of cash registers existing eco-system of terminals which is a very different set of requirements then what a small business or medium tier business needs they are really looking at it as a replacement for what used to be a Casio machine and a pin pad and so we've build these things to be able to provide solutions to both channels but they are using the same architecture.
So the e355 which is shipping in September it's the product that happened to have won this very large competitive tender with a large U.S.
cellular via retail establishment and that's the one that we really focused on the tier 1 that a lot of the time we go direct to merchants.
We also have a bid of that product which acquires loan and banks loan for a whole variety of reasons.
When you go a little bit below that we have something called as e315 we have an e265 we have an e125 those by-large are geared to markets where we don't distribute directly to the merchants.
We go through our distributors our partners.
And so it's one platform but it's got variants that satisfy a lot of different needs and that's how we get scaling economics out of it.
Incidentally before I go just to give you a sense of how important this stuff is.
In 2014 I think we did a total of like $13 million of mPOS.
Compared to most people at that time we were doing -- my competitors were doing like 40 million 50 million we were doing 13 million.
In 2015 be anywhere from -- I actually don't have the figures in front of me but my gut is that it's probably on and off 20 million to 40 million.
In 2016 we see a significant lead from where we are I think and that's on a global basis.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.
Your line is now open.
Good afternoon.
Thanks also giving us the FY16 revenue look in North America.
Just wanted to check your confidence level there Paul beyond what you've said so far.
Just trying to get a sense of visibility into the backlog and the pipeline.
I know you threw out some numbers.
But things like timing launch of your next gen platforms trying to get a sense of what could move around and potentially influence that up or down from 3% that you gave.
Well we're giving -- we've given that guidance based on stuff we could see and so as you know our new Engage devices are not yet in market and I think that with any new family of devices no matter how fantastic they are it takes a little time to ramp up.
But a lot of the growth I see or the lot of the orders I see are for our existing product going to our existing client.
We have gained certifications with more and more acquirers in the U.S.
across many different kinds of architecture direct-to-acquire direct-to-merchant route gateway I mean there's lot's of variation as you all know and as VeriFone continues to invest and gain those certifications and gain the trust of our clients it'd be really give us people that don't compete with them.
We are seeing a lot of interest from them and so that's why we're giving you the guidance.
I mean we're doing it based on what our clients tell us.
So SMB mid-tier as I mentioned is 7 million terminals or opportunities that have to or are likely to take place and there's 1 million in hospitality that's what I based it on.
I also think that we got to look at the world beyond EMV.
It's really important and maybe I haven't done a good job of explaining at least what we're thinking but the world of payment is changing just because you have an EMV terminal doesn't mean you can take the full benefit as a merchant or an acquirer of all the things that are coming down the pipe in payments.
Look at how much is been invested by the cellular companies whether it's Apple or Samsung there payments capabilities are now built into the operating systems of their phones.
The merchants need to be able to do something with that and they are going to want to do a lot more and just accept the payment token.
They are going to want to use just to communicate with their consumers to do digital media to do pay with points to do card linked offers all that's opportunity for us and that's why we built Engage.
It's a network end-point it's a two-way device It's not -- I mean yes it can accept the payment and that's great but boy that’s about 5% of the capabilities of things.
So that’s why we feel that over the next certainly 2016 I think well beyond we got a good story and our clients want it.
Good.
Just as a follow want to that any change in North America mixed debt of the landscape? Whether it's [Corver] and Ingenico or Axe or what have you just any change there from what you see? Not really I mean for us the big items were the ones I said it's mPOS that's going to be a big change.
I will tell you in Q3 we won three competitive takeaways from Ingenico in North America they won zero from us.
We had one competitive takeaway from another company.
We won 17 greenfield deals versus all of our competitors.
Clients like what we have.
They are giving us the business.
And I think people like First Data with Clover doing well with that device I am sure.
But we are seeing growth.
We are seeing market share.
We are seeing growth.
Good you to when share is up.
One more just to Marc.
Did you give the -- or size the warranty related charger hit in the quarter? Just thank you Tien-Tsin thanks for the other two questions as well.
So on the warranty I just said that it was the primary driver.
And as always there is some mix and some other things that ebb and flow but to think about that as a significant portion of the delta between Q2 and Q3.
Tien-Tsin just for a little more technical because I am a geek that way this was someone manufacturing something for us it's one of the 1 000 suppliers that we used to have before we started to get serious about supply chain.
They produced a component which failed and we stepped in immediately fixed everything as a client first company should whether was under warranty or not doesn’t matter in that particular instance we took responsibility.
We were quick about it.
We took the charge and we moved on.
We are a client first company and that’s what we are going to do.
Helpful.
Thank you guys.
Thank you Tien-Tsin.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.
Your line is now open.
Hey guys thanks for taking the question.
I guess big picture Paul we are hearing VeriFone we have for the last few quarters talk about payments-as-a-service and new functionality that's less terminal centric.
Which is clearly the way the market is going.
Is there anything we should think about in terms of revenue recognition? In other words as you sell fewer terminals just recognizing hardware revenue and more integrated hardware and services deals does that result in less up front revenue and more of a long tail? Is that in form the total organic revenue growth rate for VeriFone? Let me take that that’s my technical expertise.
So it will be a modest certainly ramp on the payment as a service side.
So I wouldn’t expect to be calling out at any point soon that I could foresee were there some material change in the margins were filed because we are moving Andrew towards a payment as a service models.
Certainly we believe strongly in that business space.
It's multiples of revenue.
It's annuity based more predictable.
But it's also a slower ramp than it is periodic sales of terminals.
I called out the good work that the team has done in Australia and the business we have in New Zealand.
So yes I think it's businesses move on a bit appropriate ramp and if there's any material changes to that we will certainly be able to project that in a timely way.
Okay.
Yes I will just hey I will just throw one thing at it.
We feel terminals for the next generation the Engage stuff or a lot of our mPOS with the software we have built you can buy the terminal then you can buy a service on top of that terminal that does a whole bunch of stuff stuff in security stuff in payment stuff in non-payment.
And so somebody can choose certainly to rent a terminal but renting a terminal is not path.
Running an application that helps with either security or getting a merchant to sell more stuff and get closer to their consumer that’s what payment as a service and commerce enable much.
And so I view that as an and I don’t do it as a replacement or an or.
Okay.
Thank you.
And just Marc with regard to the fourth quarter in particular I think I'm following up on Jason's question I just wanted to get a little clarity.
It sounds like there was a specific gross margin call out in 3Q.
So all else being equal to the extent revenue is flat sequentially shouldn't we expect your adjusted or non-GAAP EBIT margin to rise? I'm just trying to get a sense if there's anything else influencing your fourth-quarter outlook.
Well yes I do expect gross margin percentage based upon our current outlook to rise that chart was non-recurring.
So it will certainly -- we certainly expect it to be between Q3 and Q4.
I've provided a little data like I always do at the earnings presentation n other elements of the P&amp;L.
Q4 tends to be Andrew seasonably higher for us in terms of our OpEx the sales and marketing will be up slightly so that will be offsetting but the revenues we see less modest increase I think gross margins will be up as we just discussed and that will be somewhat mitigated by some investments for the fourth quarter like sales and marketing.
And then finally was there any pull forward of revenue in the third quarter from the fourth quarter? Was there anything that was unusual? No.
I would say normal course of business for us.
Now the bookings were there and our clients particularly in North America where we had beautiful quarter record $209 million of revenue the demand by client shifted and we were able to execute some normal course that may have -- we may have predicted that to be in Q4 we’re fortunate that it came in Q3 so it's really a time shift there for VeriFone in North America.
And our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel.
Your line is now open.
Thanks good afternoon.
Just wanted to follow up again I guess on the US business.
Very impressed to see the result this quarter as well as the guidance for next year.
Could you talk at all about the shift between multi lane and SMB and maybe greenfield? It sounds like you feel really confident that you are seeing that opportunity unfold.
I was unclear though just from this quarter's results are we already seeing that happen or is it still being mostly led by multi lane? And I have a follow-up thanks.
I think that what we’re seeing comes from the relationships that we have with our acquirers with banks with [indiscernible] and distributors.
And those are the folks that deliver to the small and medium merchants.
And these people have significant plans to make sure that the little guy the merchant the small medium size merchant isn't hurt by liability show.
It takes longer because it's a much more fragmented group they tended to start a little later on getting EMV ready but when consumers show up with their chip card wanting to use it and a merchant doesn't have it that chip card that’s going to be a disadvantage because consumers are quite concerned about security we've been probably more so now than ever.
So I really think that if a consumer is in a large retail environment using their chip card and they go to someplace else and it doesn't have a chip card that’s going to perhaps perhaps create some issues.
And if you are an acquirer and you are connected to these folks or if you are a bank or an [ISO] you really try to do the right thing for these clients and say hey let's get this platform secured.
So I still see strong important demand of 8 million terminals that still need to be upgraded in the United States.
So that’s 60% Tier 1 may be 90% done but these other folks are not.
Let me add a little bit more color because I think Chris you are spot on I believe we’ll start to see a shift between Tier 1 retail and SMB in fact I would say that in Q4 and again we’re projecting relatively comparable sales in North America in the aggregate but I would suggest that we see a slight shift in higher SMB very modest shift but a shift in SMB volume in Q4 a little bit higher than Q3 and then modest adjustments in the other verticals.
Marc as you look to 2016 does that continue to the extent that multi lane actually could be down next year despite your confident growth of 3% or is it -- is multi band still going? And also a related question is there a gross margin benefit next year that you are thinking about as well? Thanks.
Again on spot on we expect Tier 1 retail 90% penetrated obviously will be normal refresh as well but in the guidance of 3% North America growth Tier 1 retail is expected to be down and that will be offset by the highlights that Paul made before in terms of SMB petrol and mPOS more globally.
And I missed your point on gross margins Chris would you repeat that please? I was just hoping you'd talk about Marc just the opportunity to improve on the gross margin side all the supply chain investments you are making.
Is that part of the 3% next year? I would say I would look at it no well it is in general anything we sale next year we’re expecting that it will be under optimization of that supply chain and our team in total was able to delivered and obviously there is pluses minuses region mix etcetera but all the things that we are doing in terms of just upgraded the supply chain teams supplier collaboration consolidation improving new flight introduction our engineering teams and our supply channel are much better integrated today and then I mentioned earlier that we are really taking another fresh look at warehousing logistics and then call centers and looking for ways to that's optimizing so these things don’t happen overnight but I think you will see us generate incremental improvements that will benefit results hopefully next year.
The other I would add to that is when you think about 2016 and you say hey where is the growth coming from here is what I keep look at right I think the payment systems around the world continue to move from physical to electronic and that's not stopping if anything that's get accelerating.
We are continuing to see emphasis on security and the need for better identity management in both emerging markets and developed markets.
We're seeing a lot of regulatory influence right governments going after tax revenues we see that in fiscalization of terminals in places like Turkey my expectation is that's going to continue because governments that don’t collect their taxes are very vulnerable to lots of destruction.
We see a complete change in the world of payments and commerce Samsung Apple Google they are all converging the payments industry the commerce industry personal communications.
We're seeing un-bank people increasingly benefitting right from financial inclusion I see salaries being paid to a card government benefits going on for cards merchants needs to accept that.
And then the most important thing that I don’t think which is anyone is been anyone's model and I'd tell you that you should look at it is the whole space of omni-commerce okay so all of the cyber sourced early deals that we've been involved in the merchant buys the biggest terminal we have the MX-925 why because we are using it for a lot more than accepting a card it's got very good digital media got very good connectivity it's got a super fast processor.
That has a higher ASP and when you look at how we architect the build and are going to roll out Engage it's all about that it's all about being able to create a consumer experience in the store which is as good as what people can get online and so that is really value to soften and I don’t think it's in anyone's models but I certainly believe in it.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from the line of John Williams of Topeka Capital Markets.
Your line is now open.
Hello good evening.
Thanks for fitting me in here.
Just a quick question on Latin America.
Looking at your growth rates there when you ex out the FX impacts it is obviously up for the quarter year over year.
But I guess when you think about LatAm it is usually pretty lumpy.
I know obviously these things going on in Brazil have been challenging.
But can you just give us a little more detail on number one what's happening in Brazil? And number two whether lumpiness is a factor and why we've seen some challenging growth there in the last couple of quarters? Thanks.
Sure.
Brazil is such an important market for us.
Q3 Q4 and 2016 certainly you got to look at the Brazil recession.
It's pretty staggering right and it's not something that revenue as a technology company is going to be able to do something about all on its but we have excellent relationships with the acquires distributors where we've got a lot of people in Brazil that are focused in this market and we now are going to be launching mPOS into this market.
Where now going to be launching integrated payments into these market.
We are now going to be bringing our cloud power solution into this market and I think that we are going to fight like hell to be able to with better product to shift and share away from our competitors to us.
We don’t compete with our acquirers we have great products and we hope that that helps us to in some way isolate our P&amp;L from the recession which is undoubtedly there.
I think mentioned I think it's important is if you look at the other countries in the Latin America region we are actually seeing some really nice growth.
We see it in [indiscernible] we see it in the south cone both on a year-over-year basis which is real important and in many cases the quarter-over-quarter basis.
We are very well positioned in Mexico and we are doing very well in Argentina we are doing well in Chile so we are going to continue to treat that region as a critical region.
We hired Carlos Lima it's now a separate region reporting into me and you will see it got the kind of attention it deserves so were helping that the Brazil recession is not the only story that we could share with you in 2016 and in fact in Q4.
So you're saying just to be clear so you are saying it is by far more macro driven than any of the usual lumpiness we see just quarter to quarter by the big guys down there delaying or maybe moving purchases around? It is definitely macro related.
When you have a recession businesses go under and when they go under they are not buying a new terminal.
And our next question comes from the line of Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities.
Your line is now open.
I wanted to see if we could continue going around the world.
Emerging markets seems to be a big delta from the last time we talked.
And you called out Russia and Nigeria and now you've called out Brazil.
What other emerging markets since we last spoke three months ago have changed their trajectory and which ones are you more worried about? Well I think if you're in the oil business you've got definitely an economic issue.
Because your country and all of its infrastructure was built for a certain oil and sustainability it is nowhere near there.
So Nigeria Central Bank has pretty strict currency controls and they are going release dollars for medicine and for food before they are going to release dollars for payment terminals.
Egypt I think you know facing some pretty tough macro political and economic issues.
They too are not releasing a lot of US dollars.
Those are tough places.
We’re seeing really good growth in Poland that's an important emerging market for us.
We’re seeing good emerging market growth in certain Eastern European countries beyond Poland.
We’re seeing it in many Asian countries.
We’re seeing it in South Asia India is up 100% year over year in Q3.
They seem to be doing okay Thailand we've got a strong good business.
So I still think that this cash to cashless migration and the fiscalization the government need to do in order to collect their taxes.
Is real important but it is timing.
And Russia of course is really a tough market right now abysmally so.
In terms of opportunities could Japan become an opportunity fairly in sore market for its history could that become an opportunity as they maybe migrate to more the Western EMV NSV model? And also as we get closer to a global deal with Iran the Middle East has been a market that you've had a lot less exposure to since the sanctions began.
Is there a potential to get back into the Middle East in a more significant way? Right now it is all Ingenico and PAX in Iran which is a decently sized market and the rest of the Middle East seems to be similar distributors that were selling into Iran.
As that agreement progresses do have a chance to get back in there going forward and reclaim some share? It is early days.
Listing sanctions like look at Cuba.
We certainly have our embassy there and a lot of good press but the sanctions are still in place.
Still can't sell a terminal into Cuba hopefully that gets lifted.
In terms of Iran certainly we have sold no product into Iran since the sanctions started.
But we’re very hopeful that that market opens up because it is a great market and it is one we strongly believe in.
Japan would be terrific for us as you correctly pointed out.
It's been a closed market in terms of payments; it could open up in the next year or so.
We certainly have some early discussions taking place and we will be all over it if it does open up.
We’re also making some pretty good early moves in Korea.
That regulatory environment is changing.
They're moving to more secure products in EMV.
We had a presence in that market for a number of years.
We have some local development organization that we’re well acquainted with and we would love to get back in that market.
So we’re looking in all the right places.
We will be very disciplined about distributing our product in those markets if we see the economics play out for us.
Our next question comes from the line of S.K.Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs.
Your line is now open.
A couple if I may both related to operating margins.
Probably Paul if you could talk about first from the new product perspective how these new products whether it's the mobile point-of-sale or the payment as a service business.
Are you seeing any margin pressures related to ramp up of those businesses? What I see are occasional margin pressures from very very large reversed Dutch auction type of tenders where they really are buying just the commodity.
That is the box shipping business.
But in terms of almost every other business that we do it is actually going the other way which is our clients are expecting us to do more not less.
They want services not just product.
They want to be able to leverage VeriFone as a trusted company to help them win business with consumers.
They want to be able to do the kinds of things that I have been talking about like omni-commerce and they want to use digital media.
And they love the idea when we come in and we say okay we can have consumers be able to pay with points in real time.
We can help you such that a consumer who does something online walks into a store and the people in the store can see all of the inventory.
All of the information about the activity that that consumer has done with their brand online and vice versa.
So great devices selling great experiences typically we will have more margin not less.
And I still believe that there's a lot of innovation for which our clients are willing to pay for.
What they are not willing to pay for and rightly so I think is a me too product a commodity something that does not have the right look and feel because that's not what consumers enjoy.
I will tell you one quick anecdote because it's really amazing.
So we have been doing a lot of focus groups with both merchants and with consumers on our new engage product.
I'm going to quote a client it is a consumer and it is going to be hard to believe but this is what the consumer said.
I would drive to the store just to use the new engage device it is so freaking cool.
So we think that there is something real here.
Anecdotal maybe but these businesses are built on taking anecdotes scaling them and helping people to create the experiences where consumers buy more stuff.
Probably just on the operating margins while they head into 2016 can you probably list out the factors which have already played out in 2014 and 2015? Whether it's restructuring some of your R&amp;D centers and a few other factors and when you head into 2016 what portion of the benefits the from supply channel optimization have you already seen and what portion do you expect to see in 2016 and 2017? Let me start S.K.
this is Marc and them I'm certain Paul will add some more color on top of that please.
So I think we have made good progress in the supply chain particularly around procurement indirect procurement and direct material procurement.
But quite frankly the material benefits from those activities really get to play themselves out as we consolidate our partnership base.
S this Company had $2 billion in revenue need not have 1000 vendors.
We need a fraction of those as strategic partners and that's exactly what [indiscernible] are going to work on or are working on to make us a much more effective supply chain and procurement organization.
So I think that's there is a good runway still in that area.
So possibly still early to mid-innings on the benefits.
And then I think it is pretty much a nice greenfield opportunity still for us in the things that I've been a little redundant on and that is warehousing distribution logistics call centers and the like.
We’re trying to globalize and centralize and make everything we do more efficient.
These things take time and we have been picking our spots.
But I think the good news is that they are still good opportunities in 2016 and certainly thereafter.
And then with respect to all the good work that we have been doing around the OpEx consolidating R&amp;D facilities and creating centers of excellence in research and development and putting shared services in and hardening our IT infrastructure.
These are great hardening of infrastructure that absolutely needs to get done.
And as Paul pointed out earlier we will intend to invest.
There's a great growth profile that this Company has in front of us but we’re going to be thoughtful and we're going to drive out as much waste all the waste as possible into 2016.
I think Marc answered that completely.
We have opportunity.
There is no doubt.
We have been taking the savings and using it to build our new products.
We did not reduce our earnings.
We increased our earnings but what you don't see behind the scenes is that boy we have been investing.
And some of those things required us to have more headcount for a period of time in the case of shared services.
Other things just required a lot of R&amp;D spend.
When you build a new product line of mPOS of engage terminals of services and payments payment as a service and commerce enablement all that stuff takes money.
We've been self-funding it through efficiencies and so we’re going to continue to find efficiencies.
And I think there's a fair amount still left.
So I think you will get to that balance that all of you have been looking for saying to us well gee your competitor has better margins that is true.
As I've been saying I think they are over earning.
I think we’re under earning and we will probably meet somewhere in the middle or maybe we will do a little better but that will take some time.
But you have a commitment from us that we will get there.
Thank you S.K.
So with that I would just like to thank everybody.
This concludes the Q&amp;A section.
We look forward to speaking with many of you.
Bye bye.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference.
That does conclude today's program you may all disconnect.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Paul Galant CEO of VeriFone.
Thank you all for joining us today.
We are pleased to report that our business delivered strong financial results in Q4.
And with the launch of VeriFone’s Engage family of devices and services we really have further positioned VeriFone for client leadership and growth in the years ahead.
Q4 revenue of $514 million was a second consecutive record revenue quarter and represented a year-over-year reported growth rate of 5% and a constant currency growth rate of 15%.
In addition to again achieving record revenues we delivered earnings per share of $0.49 11% growth over last year.
Importantly we also increased our operating margins by an additional 90 basis points in the quarter to 14.8%.
Revenue earnings per share and free cash flow exceeded our expectations the 10th consecutive quarter where our results have met or exceeded our quarterly guidance.
As in our prior quarters we did exactly what we said we were going to do.
We delivered on our commitments of improved client performance and share gains in important markets.
We increased revenue growth we improved our profitability and most importantly we announced our next generation of new products and services the first for VeriFone in many many years.
We previewed these new solutions to clients in Q4 and are already seeing strong sales pipelines as a result.
For the full fiscal year we achieved our management’s scorecard targets by capitalizing on U.S.
EMV launching the VeriFone Engage family of devices and services as well as our new E Series mobile solutions expanding our payment-as-a-services business and partnering with Visa to bring merchants acquirers and banks a global omni-commerce platform for consumers.
In FY ‘15 VeriFone grew revenues by $130 million that’s an increase of 7%.
Interestingly and somewhat shockingly on a constant currency basis we would have grown $290 million or 16% in this period.
Additionally our operating margin over the year improved by 120 basis points to 14.3%.
So we accomplished these results while aggressively reinvesting to build our next generation products and services and we did all this in the face of severe FX headwinds and of course an increasingly complex global macroeconomic environment.
We are going to continue to drive revenue growth and improve our margin but we are not going to delay our sacrifice the execution of our strategic roadmap in the pursuit of short-term results.
VeriFone’s most critical mission by far is to continue transforming our company into a client-first organization and pivoting further from a vendor of payment terminals to a payment and commerce services provider.
That’s our number one goal.
As some of you may recall January 2016 will be the second year anniversary of the launch of our transformation program and we are on track to outperform all of our transformation objectives that we set back then as noted on Slide 6.
Our transformation program has conservatively generated well over $40 million in annual run rate savings with more to come in fiscal year ‘16.
Approximately 75% of the savings that we generated were reinvested into our new products and services making up for VeriFone’s lack of investment in prior years.
Our FY ‘16 new product and services roadmap is by far our most robust in at least the past decade.
It really is night and day.
Now that we have launched VeriFone’s next generation of solutions we are actively working on certification and global distribution.
We also recently announced two strategic acquisitions in the services space.
In Q4 we closed the acquisition of Curb which helped us to grow our U.S.
taxi network of card acceptance to approximately 50 000 vehicles in the U.S.
and our global total to approximately 70 000.
With this acquisition we also became a leading provider of e-hailing for taxis and are now enabling at least 90 000 consumer e-hailed rides per month.
And we recently announced as I think most of you saw the planned acquisition of InterCard a German-based payment-as-a-services provider with 75 000 connected terminals which will once completed enhance our position as a leading pan-European payment services provider with more than 700 000 connected terminals and a robust network of gateways.
Now the remaining 25% of our transformation savings drove margin and EPS improvement.
With our improved earnings and free cash flow we also announced VeriFone’s first ever stock buyback program in September.
This $200 million buyback further reinforces our commitment to a balanced approach to capital allocation our deep desire to return capital to our shareholders and the strong confidence of the Board and the management team in the future of VeriFone.
To this end we are pleased to report that we have already repurchased the first $100 million of shares.
Now I am going to discuss three major important macro trends VeriFone’s strategy and our product launches that underpin our FY ‘16 outlook.
So the first trend I want to highlight is of course the ongoing U.S.
migration to EMV where 60% of devices in the United States still need to be upgraded.
This upgrade cycle will provide tailwinds for the next several years.
Last quarter we projected VeriFone revenue growth of 3% in North America for FY ‘16.
Given the acceleration in North America’s sequential growth in Q4 for VeriFone our continued momentum with SMB clients our petroleum and services momentum and our strong backlog and increased pipeline visibility we are today announcing that we are increasing our projection for FY ‘16 North America revenue growth to 5%.
The second trend that we see is the global acceleration of cash to electronic payments.
Our on-the-ground presence in so many different markets around the globe gives us insight and confidence that the world’s move from cash to electronic payments is in fact accelerating and will gain further momentum throughout 2016.
Evidence of this includes the move to terminal fiscalization by several governments around the globe demand for 3G portable and mPOS devices the global growth in mobile wallets and programs for the unbanked VeriFone is today better positioned than ever to help our clients capitalize on this trend.
Throughout our 2-year transformation program we have made substantial investments and improvements in our regional franchises our product and product certifications and our sales leadership.
In Western Europe on a constant currency basis we continue to grow our business by double digits in key markets by taking share.
In Asia we again moved and improved sequentially as our leadership changes and our investments are starting to pay off with improved results.
And in Latin America although we expect our investments to yield long-term sustainable growth the fact is that this region continues to face significant economic and political issues and VeriFone does not yet have a full product portfolio with which to compete in places like Brazil.
There are bright spots such as Mexico such as Colombia and such as Chile where we will have a more competitive portfolio.
We – in fact we already do and we will have a more competitive portfolio of products by the second half of the year throughout the entire region including Brazil.
And finally the third trend is the convergence of payments and commerce which we are capitalizing on with VeriFone’s next generation of devices and services including gateways and solutions that help our clients to reduce security risks and drive sales.
We announced our new VeriFone Engage family of devices and we demonstrated several revolutionary new consumer identity and security solutions at the Money 2020 Conference in October which we expect to bring to market throughout 2016.
We also began shipping our top of the line e355 mPOS solution in September and will soon bring additional new mobile products to market globally.
The delivery of these devices will help accelerate the growth of VeriFone services business which we expanded geographically from 13 to 17 countries in 2015 and will grow to 21 countries in the coming year.
While services revenue declined by 2% on a reported basis in FY ‘15 it grew by 8% on a constant currency basis.
And in fiscal year ‘16 we're expecting growth of approximately 8% on a reported basis and 14% on a constant currency basis.
In fiscal year ‘16 we will bring important new services to our clients.
We will unveil the VeriFone app marketplace in the second quarter enabling our clients and third party app developers to create and deploy payment and commerce applications on VeriFone devices.
Also in the first half of the year we will begin on-boarding merchants through our global omni-commerce solution in conjunction with Visa.
And finally our digital media business that business continues to scale and we will introduce consumer targeting as well as card and smartphone linked offer functionality as a service.
In support of these three trends VeriFone’s strategy and resulting next generation products and services provide our clients with a highly differentiated value proposition.
These solutions will enable VeriFone to capture an increasing share of the $4 billion terminal solutions market and the much larger $100 billion plus market for payment services and commerce enablement.
So to close Q4 was a solid end to an important year.
The VeriFone team has done what we said we were going to do.
We strengthened our foundation and invested in the next generation of our product platform.
I couldn’t be more excited about what 2016 is going to bring.
So with that I am going to pause here and turn it over to my partner our CFO Marc Rothman.
Hi.
Thank you Paul.
Consistent with past practice we will be referring to certain financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis.
Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics are presented in our earnings release and available on our website.
Please always refer to this information for a comprehensive review of our financial results.
For fiscal year 2015 we reached a milestone with annual revenues crossing the $2 billion mark.
Revenues grew 7% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant currency basis and earnings were $1.83 compared to $1.51 in 2014 a 21% increase.
Turning to the fourth quarter we exceeded our overall financial expectations.
We reported record net revenues on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis of $514 million compared to guidance of $510 million to $513 million.
Revenues increased 5% from a year ago and excluding the impact of foreign exchange was 15% on a constant currency basis.
Earnings per share were $0.49 compared to $0.44 a year ago and also exceeded guidance of $0.47 to $0.48 per share.
Now let me discuss briefly results by product line.
Q4 revenues for system solutions were $339 million it was up 9% year-on-year and up 17% on a constant currency basis.
We continue to build momentum across this product line as we deploy new solutions globally and benefit from the acceleration of EMV mobility and petroleum.
Service revenues were $175 million in Q4 down 3% year-over-year.
On a constant currency basis year-over-year revenue growth was 10%.
We saw continued growth in our payments-as-a-service business as well as strength in taxi and media businesses.
Service revenues comprised 34% of our business during the quarter and we expect services to grow as a component of our business in the coming quarters.
Turning to our strong gross margin performance consolidated gross margin was 43.4% up 170 basis points sequentially and up 110 basis points compared to a year ago.
For system solutions gross margins improved to 43.2% of revenue compared to 41.1% last quarter and 41.5% a year ago.
These improvements reflect both favorable mix and supply chain improvements across both procurement and quality as we leverage the benefits of our supply chain transformation.
Services gross margins of 43.9% were up 100 basis points compared to the prior quarter reflecting favorable mix of service revenues and were comparable to the prior year.
Consolidated operating expenses in Q4 were $147 million an increase of $6 million compared with Q3 reflecting additional investments in new product and services platforms including in China as well as higher year end expenditures for sales and marketing efforts.
Let me now discuss results by geography.
In North America we delivered record revenues of $230 million representing 10% growth sequentially and 54% year-over-year.
Our North America multi-lane retail group continued to deliver excellent results.
Revenue was up significantly from last year and modestly down from the prior quarter as expected.
Both our mobile products and security solutions were key drivers during Q4.
Our U.S.
petrol business delivered another strong quarter with sequential growth and significant growth from a year ago.
We continue to gain market share with our next generation products including our site controllers and POS systems.
We expect accelerating momentum in petro business with our Gilbarco partnership ramp up which will allow us to capitalize on the 2017 EMV liability shift.
And in our small and medium business vertical we delivered excellent results sequentially and significant growth on a year-over-year basis driven by market share gains of EMV-ready solutions to the channel certified products to the market and expanding relationships across all major acquirers and processors.
And finally in North America net revenues in taxi payment transaction and media businesses were similar to third quarter levels and up year-over-year.
Turning to Latin America revenues for Q4 were $63 million down 15% sequentially 23% year-over-year on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis.
The economic environment in Brazil is the primary driver for these declines partially offset by growth in other Latin America markets.
We expect continued macro softness in this region in the first half of 2016 but expect the launch of new products including our mPOS solution to improve these results during the second half of FY 2016.
In Middle East – in Europe Middle East and Africa revenues of $164 million were down 5% sequentially and 13% from the prior year reflecting foreign exchange headwinds.
On a constant currency basis year-over-year revenues however were down 2%.
We continue to see double-digit year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis and improving market share throughout Western Europe contributing to strengthen stability in this part of the region.
The region results were slightly impacted by challenges in oil dependent markets including Russia and Nigeria.
And finally in Asia Q4 revenues of $57 million were up 4% sequentially down 18% from the prior year and 3% on a constant currency basis.
These year-over-year declines occurred primarily in China as expected.
We are optimistic about our longer term opportunities in China market and continued to invest in developing locally designed and engineered products for this region.
Australia and New Zealand businesses continued to do well with significant year-over-year growth.
We are making good progress on product and service deployments with Westpac in the rollout of our payment-as-a-service business across these two countries.
Now turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $209 million gross debt of $799 million and net debt of $590 million.
In late September our Board of Directors approved our first ever stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $200 million worth of shares.
Since our announcement we have repurchased 3.5 million shares for $100 million or half of our authorized program with 75% of this amount completed in Q4.
We are committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy including capital return to shareholders when strategic needs are met.
We will continue to repurchase shares under our program throughout FY 2016 subject to business and market conditions.
Now I would like to briefly discuss working capital metrics.
Overall our cash conversion cycle was 44 days in Q3 which represents an improvement of 5 days compared to Q3 and an increase of 2 days compared to a year ago.
The change from Q3 was primarily driven by improvements in accounts payable days partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable days.
Turning to cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2015 cash flow from operations was $81 million and free cash flow was $52 million.
Both cash flow metrics reflect our best quarterly performance in the last three years.
Capital expenditures were $28 million in the quarter.
Approximately 45% of these expenditures relate to customer premises equipment for payment-as-a-service taxi and media businesses and the related infrastructure.
And lastly let me discuss financial guidance.
For fiscal year 2016 we are guiding revenues of $2.09 billion to $2.11 billion reflecting revenue growth of 5% and constant currency revenue growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of this guidance.
This outlook reflects expectations that North America will grow 5% and excludes revenue from pending acquisitions.
The impact of an acquisition will be included in guidance and provided on earnings calls once an acquisition has closed.
We expect earnings per share for FY ‘16 in the range of $2.15 to $2.17 and we expect free cash flow generation to be approximately $175 million.
And for Q1 we are guiding non-GAAP revenue of $500 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.45 per share.
Please refer to Slide 16 of our earnings presentation for additional forward-looking financial information.
Thank you.
And with that let me now open the call to your questions.
Mike? Thank you sir.
[Operator Instructions] The first question we have comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.
Hi good afternoon.
Thanks for taking the question.
Just I will ask on North America first just the up 5% obviously upward revision from the 3 percentage you stated.
But maybe can you give us some more detail on what’s giving you the greater confidence here to revise that up to 5%? Hey Tien-tsin it’s Paul.
Thanks for asking the question.
Yes I think there are number of things.
I can think of at least five off the top of my head that caused us to do that.
One is that with EMV we still have 60% of the 13 million point-of-sale devices or about 8 million that need EMV upgrade and that’s roughly what we predicted in the last few quarters but 8 million devices that needs – still need to be upgraded is a pretty good – pretty big field.
Tier 1 as I think everybody knows is mostly finished but our SMB business is really accelerating and Greenfield remains a big opportunity and is starting to turn.
So our thoughts is that by October of 2016 so at the end of our fiscal year just give you about still 40% or 5 million EMV terminals that would still need to be upgraded.
So that’s why we – in addition to having a conviction in 2016 growth we see it going beyond that.
As Marc mentioned Petro the liability shift in 2017 is something that folks are really starting get ahead of.
They see how difficult it’s been for the merchants the general merchant community to get to the EMV date in 2015.
So they are starting early and they are focused.
We think that’s about a $50 million incremental revenue opportunity for us in FY ‘16.
We have got very strong client relationships in Petro.
We have the right technology the right services.
And we think that all of that in combination with our Gilbarco relationship is really going to allow us to do quite well.
The third area is mPOS.
Just in general it is something that there is a lot of interest in.
In Tier 1 one of the biggest opportunities and we see it in Tier 2 as well is to supplement the countertops with devices that salespeople can walk around with.
That will be a big deal for us.
Mobile payments is really expanding.
Despite questions around some of these articles I can tell you that the mobile wallet providers whether that would be the folks at Apple or Samsung or Google or how you listen in some of the others like MCX all of that gets to more opportunity for us.
And then lastly is media.
We have got the largest digital media network out-of-home network in the United States.
We are seeing a lot of interest by advertisers.
We are growing that.
And the Curb acquisition definitely helped the network.
We think all of that is going to play to our strength.
Okay.
That is helpful.
And then just as my follow up and just on the international front I guess reported revenue growth implies 5% clearly faster constant currency and you exited the year down internationally.
So just thinking about ‘16 maybe the geographic mix the composition by region any more detailed guidance there to give? Thanks.
Well let me take the first stuff.
I am sure Marc will give us good facts but bit of a frustrating situation I would say the things that VeriFone can do well is to have the right product and the right service in the right markets.
And I feel that if you look at the business in FY ‘16 in local currency terms right which is the currencies in which we actually do business we took share we grew revenue.
The translation from that local currency to the U.S.
dollar was obviously a nightmare all year.
So we continue to believe that the work that we do the things we can control will help us to capture share.
The products that we have and the services are better than those of our competitors.
We are confident.
As those products and services get certification and distribution we will capture more share.
What we cannot account for unfortunately is the fact that oil countries which have been buying our products are not buying as many products of anything because they have been walloped.
There is a lot of political turmoil going on in the rest of the world and it’s just harder than ever to forecast.
So rather than leaning heavily into it and give you a rosy picture we are looking up the reality of a rather uncertain time in these kinds of markets and we will do our best but it’s a little bit tough to forecast.
Marc I don’t know if you want to have anything to add to that.
I do.
Hey Tien-tsin thanks.
So let me put a wrapper around actually all four geographies and I want to start with North America.
So North America in 2015 we did around $790 million of revenue.
And Paul and I have guided to 5% growth.
And within North America the four verticals of small medium business petro and taxi we expect significant growth.
Petro will lead those three verticals.
And as I pointed out in my opening remarks with multi-lane we expected and saw that continue to trend down as large retailers complete most of their EMV hardware migrations.
So that’s the wrap around North America going into 2016.
There is a number of tales across the international theaters and I will start with EMEA.
So again we would expect mid single-digit percent growth on a reported basis and there will be some I think real positives in Western Europe for us generally speaking.
And as Paul pointed out in these oil-producing countries and I mentioned Russia and Nigeria we expect the continued normal pressure there.
So Europe if you think about it made – EMEA mid single-digits and then 2X that on a constant currency basis.
Asia is a similar story in terms of growth.
We are expecting 5% or mid single-digit again percent growth on a reported basis and again 2X that on constant currency.
China will be a little bit more muted for us as we rebuild that franchise and hope by the middle of 2016 we will begin to launch the new products that we are working on.
And Latin America is a tougher patch for us and we both covered that early on.
We are guiding Latin America we are expecting it conservatively to be flat to down.
Again Brazil is in pretty significant recession.
It’s a very important market and customer base for us.
It’s a rough patch.
And we are just going to guide cautiously in Latin America and that’s reflected in the numbers that we have provided.
Alright that’s great.
That’s all good and reasonable.
Thank you.
Thank you Tien-tsin.
Next we have Dan Perlin RBC Capital.
Hi guys.
Thanks for taking my question.
I wanted to circle back on North America just for a second.
You just called out petro as being kind of the leader of the pack is there not any sensitivity to these contracts that you guys have set up with Gilbarco around oil prices at all so we shouldn’t be at all concerned about that variability it sounds like that’s just going to get built out and the incremental I think you said it was $50 million.
It sounds like that’s what you said last quarter so I am assuming the acceleration is either coming in SMB or maybe better than expected multi-lanes from these other opportunities I just want to get a finer point on that? Thanks.
Yes.
Well let me start and then Paul will add some more color.
So first of all Dan thanks for the question.
Petro was broken out really into two markets for us inside the convenience store and that’s where all of the momentum has come from in 2015 and we see significant momentum going into 2016 around that.
Gilbarco partnership is very complementary to us and that’s outside in the fourth quarter at the pump and that begins – that continues to ramp or really begins to ramp with devices as well as media.
And with respect to the petro numbers being the most significant of the three verticals I call that in 2016 in terms of growth correct SMB also caught momentum.
So we are really pleased with what we saw in Q4 and the pipeline of visibility looks really good in small medium business as well.
Is there anything to call out on the – the DSOs gone up to 63 days versus the prior year I mean I know in aggregate you still manage this thing incredibly tight but that did step up and I didn’t get the full explanation so what’s driving that? Well these things do ebb and flow and it’s dependent upon the timing of shipments in any given quarter.
I think if this does tie well to North America and SMB the liability shift date being end of October there was higher shipments in October in North America than originally planned by the way contributed to the upside in North America.
So we saw higher sales in October in that region.
The good news that is that the momentum continues very nicely into Q1 and thereafter.
Hey Dan before we hang up on that question you asked about oil prices and its effect on Gilbarco.
There is little to no effect oil prices vis-à-vis the gas station operators maybe people will get gas more often which is kind of what we want and we will visit the convenience store more often which is also what we want with more money in their pocket.
So if anything I think lower gas prices helps our petro vertical.
Okay.
I was thinking more of the working capital requirements but I guess that’s more of a job or you should earn this for Gilbarco so okay.
Thank you.
You’re welcome.
Thank you.
Next we have S.K.
Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs.
Thanks for taking my questions.
A couple if I may.
Probably to start off what portion of the cost savings in FY ‘16 are you reinvesting into the business? And the second question on free cash flow what are the key drivers for free cash flow growth in FY ’16 and can you provide any CapEx guidance? Yes.
Let me take the first one.
So as I think everybody knows we were dealing with a pretty significant technical debt a technology debt going into 2014 and ’15 we have been digging ourselves out of that successfully.
Applying the – most of the savings that we generate in our transformation we used to put back into the business and fill our new Engage family of products our new gateway architecture all the ADKs and we have been really at it.
We do not need [Technical Difficulty] level these particular areas.
And I would imagine it’s going from 75% to about 50% towards products.
The fact is is that we like making sure that when we see opportunities to go into this $100 billion pool of payment services and commerce enablement we want to have the ability to spend as we see ways of capitalizing on that growth and at marketplace monetizing our screens the next generation of applications that we have these are all ways that I think we can capture a much much larger market as well as expanding our footprint services.
As I mentioned we did – we went from 13 to 17 and we are going to grow again to 21.
All of that obviously requires investment but we think it’s got a good certainly a good long-term return.
Hi S.K.
let me add some color on your comment or question on cash flow.
So free cash flow we are guiding to $175 million.
And just for a point of reference it’s up 23% from last year’s $143 million.
And within that the CapEx we are going to guide to $110 million.
If you recall we guided higher last year and we ended up coming at $107 million.
So as a percentage of revenue CapEx is being I think effectively managed.
Last year a few projects pushed out in taxi and whatnot things are on track but we are certainly trying to keep reigns on CapEx.
So you got $110 million of CapEx and you should model here for depreciation amortization about $65 million or so.
And then in between there was just changes in CapEx and some hangover on some restructuring costs that we announced and we accrued and that will be paid into 2016.
So think about $175 million as the balance guidance for 2016.
That’s great.
Thank you.
You’re welcome.
Andrew Jeffrey SunTrust.
Hi guys.
Thanks for taking the question and thank you Marc for the geo detail that’s I think that’s really helpful.
Paul I think in conversations with you and in public comments you seem to be gaining a lot of confidence and in fact granular confidence as it relates to fiscal ‘16 revenue guidance around the services strategy.
And I think you laid out the Visa gateway relationship is a pretty important driver media as an important driver of this services acceleration in ’16 can you just maybe describe exactly what you are seeing that gives you that confidence especially around the omni-channel offering with CyberSource how is that going to work and how do you get paid? And – because I think if there is a lot of conviction out there that’s going to help investors feel especially this valuation like VeriFone’s bargain? Yes.
Well listen Andrew thank you for the question.
As I said we are singularly focused pivoting the company from the perception that we are a vendor of hardware to what is the reality which is we are a services provider.
We love the fact that we have these terminals as a footprint in 150 countries in order to scale.
And I agree with you I don’t think that the current stock price reflects all of that but it’s important stuff.
Let me start with the services IBM and I will have Marc comment on the specifics of the CyberSource deal.
But services has a couple of buckets guys that I think that the strategy that we have laid out is one that we can point to specific places where it’s monetizing already and now the question is how quickly can it scale.
So you start with a device which is at the last inch of where commerce is done.
150 countries now we are in 29 million locations because that’s the number of terminals we have outstanding.
Take advice that really is they are just to do a payment and we shift it as a box.
Over the years each one of those are going to get converted to a network endpoint.
The device is connected to a Gateway the Gateway has connections to an App Store and the App Store contains things which go well beyond the payment.
And I demoed a number of them in Money 2020.
Those applications when they are run on these terminals they get half the world’s card transactions going through them.
So we have to actually capture a very small amount of activity in order to make a big difference in economics.
That’s why we say we are going for the – after the $10 billion payment-as-a-service market and the $100 billion commerce enablement market.
With that as a strategy going from a terminal that has a relatively low long-term value you sell it it costs you something to manufacture it costs you something to warranty it and then you hope to sell it again 5 years later when a rule change happens or if somebody wants to refresh.
That was the bulk of the business.
We are moving to a place where you deliver a service that happens to have a terminal but it’s got a lot of other value-added services attached to it.
And so that creates an annuity revenue stream.
The connection to CyberSource and Visa the purpose of that is to capture all of the sales channels that merchants care about and be able to provide the same experience to consumers whether they are standing next to our device using their mobile phone or sitting at home with their iPad or a laptop.
The infrastructure to do that on a global basis is a very very unique asset and the companies that have that unique asset by working together Visa and VeriFone we can create this omni-commerce platform where you buy online you pickup in-store you do all of the lifecycle management and you are able to maintain the history of what that consumer does for the benefit of the merchant across all of those channels.
That is a very different revenue margin and earnings growth company than what I think historically you have seen from VeriFone and quite frankly which is how we are being valued today in my opinion.
Marc I don’t know if you want to....
Well I was just going to thanks Paul hi Andrew.
I was just going to add some financials on top of it just to give another holistic view.
So $692 million worth of services revenue in 2015 guiding to reported growth of 8%.
And just to complement what Paul said or I will be additive to it the media business certainly inside petrol is a nice contributing factor as well.
The petrol business growing also attracts a very good services model we are able to get significant services from annual maintenance agreements and whatnot so that’s certainly a positive too.
And our payment-as-a-service business not to leave that out of the discussion continues to grow in geographies including North America.
So I just wanted to add a few data points Andrew around the 8% growth and is being tied to petrol payment-as-a-service services media and the taxi business as well.
Okay.
Thank you for that.
And then a quick one as well you mentioned Paul I think that you are seeing your – some of your SMB channel relationships improve.
Do you think you have a sustainable share shift at work there? I do Andrew.
I think that we have which is why I mentioned the visibility into the sales pipeline and channels.
Our clients want to do more business with us.
They like us as a partner.
They trust us as a partner.
They like our new products.
They like our services.
We have certainly greatly improved the relationships across the board and we are now seeing the benefit of share shift in our channels.
My strong conviction is that that’s going to continue and it’s going to certainly go well beyond North America.
I just think we are a better partner more financial institutions and merchants than we have ever been and we intend to continue to improve on that lead.
The long-haul the intent has always been Certs.
Like I tell you that will happen it’s an all the project plans I have got dates it just takes a little bit of time so no instant gratification but a tremendous amount of demand and visibility which is why we are making the statements that we are making about North America.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Thank you Andrew.
Next we have Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.
Hi guys.
I just want to ask a couple of questions on – I guess the first one was there any supply constraints? We heard some scuttlebutt in the market that there were some supply constraints especially maybe in even in small business.
And then secondly just looking for cadence by quarter in North America I assume the first quarter maybe you can give us some guidance there Marc and then what it looks like going throughout the year? Thanks.
Yes let me start with the supply.
I think that that was greatly overblown.
Here is what happened which is pretty straightforward.
Instead of ordering 100 000 terminals we have got orders for 200 000 terminals and that’s a good thing.
And so instead of being able to deliver everything in one week we have to extend it over two weeks.
I mean it’s that kind of thing.
Certainly the amount that we had promised to deliver we delivered.
The incremental took within a week or two but it’s – everyone has got my phone number who is a client and I am not getting calls about that and in all my conversations people are pretty happy with our products and the delivery of them.
So I just don’t see it Bryan.
Okay yes.
Good.
And let me add some color.
I should probably start with the consolidated quarter so $500 million guidance for Q1 and then ramping up each quarter sequentially.
In North America I think we will have a pretty strong Q1 I would expect it to be down slightly from Q4.
And I am really looking at least for planning purposes on Q2 Q3 and Q4 to be probably slightly off Q1 but relatively flat in each one of those periods.
There is still at least from of visibility perspective I have – Paul and I have nice visibility into SMB and we see a lot of momentum off of the October date.
So we are guiding up a little bit more in the SMB market.
We will see how that plays out but we are a little bit more balanced the rest the year.
You are talking about sequentially Marc for all those? Well I am talking about a strong Q1 and then down Q2 and then really across the board Q2 Q3 and Q4 at least from a planning purpose we are about the same amount in each quarter in North America.
Okay.
But Q1 will be down slightly only slightly though sequentially is what you are saying on a from 4Q to 1Q? Correct that’s right.
Okay.
Last question for me you talked about I think two times the growth rate for mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in EMEA and Asia both those would be solid recoveries.
What gives you the confidence that you are going to see an acceleration I think the EMEA was down and Asia were down on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter? Thanks so much.
Sure.
I think just in general we have got good visibility into pipeline.
It was a tough comp for us in 2015 clearly in certain pockets like China so that’s behind us.
I think we continued to take some share into the just general macro in some of those marketplaces.
And again I would say that the comp was pretty tough in EMEA as well in 2015 off of a tough Russia downtick for us we had significant reduction in revenues in oil producing countries and based upon our outlook and maybe the more much more balanced comp we don’t see that issue going into 2016.
So it’s I guess more normalized and the pipeline from what I could see would substantiate the 5% or mid single-digit in the 2X constant currency growth in that region as well.
Great.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Thanks Bryan.
Next we have Meghna Ladha of Susquehanna.
Hi.
Thanks for taking my question congratulations on a good quarter.
I was just trying to figure out the petrol segment you did say that the 2017 EMV liability shift is starting early but how long do you think it will take the petro margins to fully upgrade to EMV could this be – could they get all done in 2017 or is this more of a 3-year revenue opportunity for VeriFone? Meghna thanks for the question.
It is definitely more than 1 year stint here.
I think if you speak to any merchant any merchant at all across the U.S.
what you will find out it is those that we are able to process an EMV transaction on October 1 2015 started early in 2014 it is a process.
There are – the U.S.
has built itself on magnetic stripe and all the infrastructure is magnetic stripes.
So when you do the upgrade you are not just upgrading the hardware you are upgrading the – what happens at the acquirer you are upgrading what happens in the payment network you are upgrading what happens across all the certification points.
So it is a process.
And so I think that what I hope I communicated was that the petrol community has seen just how hard hit it has been in the general merchant community and they are starting early.
But that just means that more petrol as a percentage will be ready on the 2017 EMV date.
I think among U.S.
merchants only 8% were able to accept an EMV payment on October 1 gives you a sense.
So I think more we will be able to accept it but it is a multi-year process beyond 2017.
Got it.
And then any early feedback on the new VeriFone Engage device that you are selling into the SMB segment how does the price point compare to the terminals that are currently sold to this segment and what’s the value proposition you are – especially for multi-sensitive merchants? Thank you for that question.
So we are in field trial with one of the largest banks in Mexico today in VeriFone Engage.
Responses from both consumers and the merchants that are acquired by this particular bank have been outstanding.
I think what you will hear from people that have used it and seen it they think it’s got a great intuitive consumer-driven design and UI which is very important.
It’s – it really is quite a bit different than what you are used to on a payment device that is not just software but that’s also the way that that software works on the device.
They love the flexible communication options so there are many many ways that that Engage device talks to a consumer not just with a great high resolution powerful screen but also talks to their phone talks to their card it allows for all sorts of different communication protocols well beyond what we can do today with our other devices.
It’s got expanded payment options it’s commerce-enabled which is – which means that if you really peel the onion about 20% of that device is really engineered for the payment and it’s great security and all that but 80% of it is deal for – is really designed to engage in a commerce dialogue with the consumer right? This is where you are able to offer a coupon or a loyalty program you are able to burn points you are able to do all sorts of things in a seamless way and that’s what’s really impacting the I think the reaction and why we are confident of the pipeline.
In terms of the price point I think it’s a good question.
Look first of all there is a groundbreaking architecture on which this device was built.
The operating system is Linux VeriFone has had 10 years experience with Linux everything that that system is built on is – works through a comprehensive development environment the ADK and it’s supported on the Engage platform.
So if you built your application your payment applications for say an AMEX or VX device you can use them on the Engage device that is a big deal that backward compatibility is really important.
And in terms of the price point and cost what I could tell you is that the margin on these devices is great and it’s great because we have built in the way that is our next generation architecture and that we are able to build variations of it ones that are appropriate for emerging markets ones that are appropriate for developed markets it’s a family of devices this is not just a box.
Got it.
And just a very quick one from my side can you just have – given the Q1 actually guidance that came in a little bit light versus what we were expecting Marc can you just walk us through the consolidated revenue and EPS progression through the course of the year? Well yes.
The revenue progression it’s somewhat similar to last year.
Q1 was our – if you will light point for the year I would expect it to ramp accordingly.
The second half is certainly more significant magnet primarily around our expectation that Latin America is more balanced Latin America is going to be a tough first half for VeriFone.
And the only thing I have guided right now to magnet is the $0.45 to Q1.
I would – I think it will be a – let me say a – Q2 shouldn’t be too far off that number and then I feel comfortable the second half on the $2.15 to $2.17 we will be able to incorporate the second half results to get to the overall guidance and earnings per share.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Next we have Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.
Hi guys.
Thanks.
I just wanted to come back to the international outlook a little bit make sure I have got the numbers straight because it seems like if we start with the North America guide the 5% and then trying essentially back into international for constant currency it seems like it would need to land around 12% or so if my math is right.
And I know you talked about 10-ish EMEA and APAC it doesn’t seem like Lat-Am will be that high co can you just reconcile that for me? Yes.
I think well Lat-Am will be a little bit better then clearly up to a constant currency perspective so that is the delta.
So you should think about I mean it’s right 5% North America so therefore 5% on a reported basis rest of world.
But in terms of the constant currency growth I would expect like I have said 2X in EMEA and Asia-Pac and then the delta to get to the 8% constant currency 9% constant currency is the – is incorporated by our growth in – you can call it Latin America and maybe Canada to some small degree.
So Lat-Am will be north of 10% in constant currency? Jason I don’t have the exact number next to me but it’s certainly the difference between what I mentioned on the EMEA and the Asia-Pac it makes up the delta there.
Guys I think it’s important just to reiterate we are looking at the same economic data that you all are looking at vis-à-vis places like Brazil Argentina anyone who produces oil.
And at a $30 whatever it is $35 $36 oil barrel and with the political turmoil that we are seeing we are just – we are not going to lean into guidance that we can’t get comfortable with.
So I think that it is what it is.
It is a really screwed up environment out there right now.
If you are in the business of selling things that could be postponed by a quarter.
And so that is why you are getting the guidance that we are going to give not because we don’t have complete confidence in the fact that we have got the products people want and the solutions that people want and that there is a hell of a lot of growth around both of those.
If the economy starts these macroeconomic forces start to look even a little bit better.
I think we are going to do a lot better but right now we are guiding to what we see.
Okay.
I have a sub-call Christine and Doug can certainly help reconcile the constant currency guidance that we provided.
And maybe just to follow up on that comment Paul about the macro I mean do you think – has there been any share shift in Brazil recently? No.
I think first of all Brazil is dominated by two acquirers you know that there are some others that are certainly working hard.
Our relationship with those two acquirers having never been better ever and the products that we are showing these two acquirers are products that they want.
And if it wasn’t for the fact that they are in a pretty severe recession I think you would see that that share shift combined with historical growth or even half of the historical growth would have provided for a nice uplift but we are where we are.
They are in a tough pickle.
We have a new General Manager in Brazil who we have hired guy comes from Informatica and SAP.
He is just superb a superb professional building a great team.
The products are the right products.
We will mPOS in that market in a big way and it’s an mPOS set of products that are better than what these guys are buying today from our competitors.
So I am comfortable with the game plan can’t get comfortable with the economy at the moment.
And just the last one for me would you offer any thoughts on kind of once we get past the bulk of U.S.
EMV and when we are in a more kind of normalized macro environment globally what sort of sustainable range or top line growth do you think the company can see over a multi-year period if we just think about that in constant currency terms? I think we have got to look at it from an industry perspective.
I got the color out here now Jason for 2016.
What we have historically said is that we believe that the system solutions side should be mid to high single digits and service capture should be 10% plus.
That’s more of a macro view.
What I can tell you is that I feel pretty good in terms of our own visibility into North America.
I don’t think that 2016 is a cliff year.
I can see visibility across these verticals and then refresh cycles thereafter that keep that momentum but I would use some of the industry numbers that Paul and I have put out there historically and I look at North America as continuing to keep momentum.
Let me just add I think that’s exactly right Marc.
We see double-digit growth in the long-term for our company.
We have been consistent.
I see three buckets.
One is the devices business solutions Terminal Solutions business.
That as I think I have said that revenue pool globally is $4 billion and it’s growing.
The universe of devices that we have out there has grown substantially.
It’s now up $29 million.
When I started here it was closer to $26 million.
The bigger your universe the more you are going to have opportunity to upgrade those devices.
Those upgrades historically have been because of regulations ECI EMV.
Most recently those two are absolutely pushing forward.
I mean you are seeing Japan and Korea go to EMV.
PCI given the security environment is more active than ever.
And also you have fiscalization.
Let’s not forget that all of these countries especially the ones that are having trouble collecting taxes use fiscalization as a means for gaining revenue.
We are seeing it in Turkey.
We are seeing it in other parts of the world.
All of that translates into more device sales okay? The next generation terminals like Engage they are going to drive growth where people are upgrading the device not just for regulation not just for security but now because they want the device because it helps them to sell more stuff helps them to have a better relationship with their consumers which is where we get into the second and third buckets one being payment-as-a-service.
We think that’s a $10 billion market.
We expanded our footprint from 13 to 17 countries in fiscal year ‘15 and we are growing to 21 in FY ‘16.
So the footprint gets bigger.
The services are allowing us to go after more of that $10 billion pie and then obviously the commerce enablement market which is we believe at least $100 billion and that’s all around the services that we demoed at Money 2020.
So we see this as double-digits.
We see as the long-term.
We are getting out of the technical debt that we are in.
And now it’s really based on how good our products are and how good we are at servicing our clients and I feel very good about those two things.
Thank you.
Michael we have time for one more question please.
Yes sir.
The question will come from Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities.
Yes thank you very much for taking my question.
In the U.S.
as you have gone through the first year of the EMV cycle one of the claims out there is that as existing small business that already accept cards went to EMV there was a tossup decision for them whether or not to continue with the same provider switch to audio jack based acceptance let’s call it that.
Have you seen in the first year of EMV a share loss as all these small businesses have had to make a decision about their existing acceptance? Not at all I mean not even a little bit.
So we have not lost business.
We haven’t seen that.
I think that very small merchants have been presented with opportunities from their acquirer from their bank and from folks like Square and others.
And as we have said we see growth in SMB.
I think what’s really happening is you are having a market expansion which is great.
More merchants are able to accept cards which is really what I talked about as the second macro trend that we are seeing which is the shift from electronic – from paper to electronic or cash electronic payments is accelerating.
That we are seeing.
And it is possible that the audio jack providers are capturing a share of that but well I will tell you we are seeing our business really grow.
And then in terms of your acquisition InterCard and Curb InterCard is it a payment-as-a-service like the Point? Is that the business model? How big is it just to – in an order of magnitude? And then Curb is that an advertising model or also a per transaction model? Man thank you for asking that.
I thought no one would ever ask that.
So let me start with Curb because we have closed that acquisition.
We got two things from Curb that I think are very important.
Curb has a network of taxis out there where they accept card-based payments okay.
That means this is very similar to what VeriFone taxis are but they earn 60 things.
So we were able to acquire that network.
I think that for card payment acceptance we are talking about something around I believe it’s 15 000 or so taxis but then they also have an e-hailing application which consumers really like and our taxi fleet owners that we service all around the country given the pressure that they are seeing from people like Uber and others really want to have a best-in-class e-hailing solution.
So we get to deliver that.
And their e-hailing solution today does about maybe fine with ours as I said about 90 000 e-hailing rides a month.
So that gives us a full fleet or a full product suite to be able to deliver to the taxi businesses in the U.S.
and around the globe.
So we will be at 70 000 taxis with – as we close Curb.
Okay.
So that’s Curb.
That’s taxis.
It’s a – it was something that we purchased because we did the build versus buy and it was cheaper to buy than to build it ourselves very simple.
It’s a great capability it’s a great group for people couldn’t be happier that they are part of the VeriFone family.
InterCard is a completely different thing.
InterCard is a payment-as-a-service provider exactly as you said it is similar to Point.
They have about 75 000 or so connected terminals.
They provide for switching payment switching in the local German schemes which is you probably know that in Germany it’s mostly debit transactions they are not credit card transactions.
They focus on Tier 1 and Tier 2 merchants.
They get paid per transaction.
It’s a great company owned by a family that built it from nothing a father and his three sons and we are just really excited to get to closing with them.
I think it’s going to allow us to be a great pan-European provider.
We have had this as a hole in our service offering.
We have not been able to do as much as we want to do for European merchants without having this capability in Germany.
Building it ourselves would have taken too long and cost too much money.
We are very happy that they agreed to partner with us and be acquired.
Great thank you very much.
Okay.
