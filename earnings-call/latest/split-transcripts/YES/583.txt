Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong> Thank you Andy and good morning everyone.
Before beginning I would both like to welcome Andy Weingardt to his first earnings call as our new leader of IR and express our sincere thanks to Chris Gay for a job well-done overall these years.
Chris as you may know has assumed a larger role at Cabela's and we know he will succeed immensely.
Although our second quarter results underperformed our expectations our full-year expectations remain intact.
Our second quarter results were below expectations as a result of softer than anticipated merchandise sales merchandise margin compression due to a slightly more aggressive promotional cadence and higher than expected cost related to incentive compensation and investments in labor.
During the quarter we were particularly pleased with sequential improvement in comparable store sales strong growth in several key merchandise categories and excellent performance from Cabela's CLUB.
We are confident in our ability to generate strong performance for the second half of the year with further sequential improvement in both comparable store sales and Direct revenue channel stabilization of merchandise gross margin tight expense control and operating margin expansion.
First let's discuss the continued improvement in comparable store sales with U.S.
comp store sales up 0.8% the first quarter of positive U.S.
comp store sales since the third quarter of 2013.
U.S.
comp improvement was led by positive comp performance in hunting equipment camping fishing firearms ammunition power sports and home and gift categories.
We were particularly pleased to see firearms generate positive U.S.
comps for the first time since the second quarter of 2013 and expect positive comp performance in the firearms and ammunition categories to benefit traffic to our stores.
Consolidated comparable store sales were down 0.9% for the second quarter as compared to down 1.3% for the first quarter of 2015.
We expect to see further sequential improvement in comparable store sales through the second half of the year.
For the quarter Direct revenue decreased 7% as a result of ongoing declines in ammunition sales as customers shift back to making ammo purchases in our retail stores with inventory levels continuing to improve.
Direct revenue also faced the headwind of continued cannibalization from our retail stores.
For the quarter we were particularly pleased to see continued Direct channel growth in our camping category.
Since rolling out our new assortment of camping products this spring in conjunction with our Cabela's camp branding campaign we could not be more pleased with our customers' response to this new and exciting line of products.
Our omni-channel strategy continues to generate meaningful improvements in the shopping experience for our customers.
During the second quarter we saw continued migration of customer traffic to mobile devices with nearly one-half of all Direct channel traffic coming from handheld devices.
Our investment in our new mobile platform and digital capabilities has proven to be very beneficial as we continue to see our customers migrate to mobile devices.
For the quarter merchandise margins decreased 120 basis points as compared to the same quarter a year ago.
The decrease was primarily due to headwinds from merchandise mix with lower sales penetration in soft goods and higher sales penetration in hard goods as well as a more aggressive promotional cadence.
We expect merchandise gross margins to stabilize in the second half of 2015.
Operating profit decreased by 190 basis points for the second quarter as a result of an increase in certain fixed costs such as incentive compensation new stores preopening costs and distribution in Canada.
These increases will become less impactful in the second half of the year.
We are currently executing several detailed cost savings initiatives to lower expenses that will provide meaningful benefit during the second half of 2015 and beyond.
As previously discussed in the third quarter we will lap the reversal of incentive compensation from the third quarter a year ago.
Therefore we expect expenses to deleverage again in the third quarter before leveraging expenses in the fourth quarter generating meaningful improvements to profitability.
Now let's take a look at our Cabela's CLUB which had another exceptional quarter and continued to build our base of extremely loyal customers.
For the quarter the average number of active accounts increased 7% and the average balance of credit card loans increased by 12.9% to $4.3 billion.
Cabela's CLUB members are our most loyal customers with higher average spend and greater purchase frequency.
Now turning to earnings guidance.
Strong performance in several key merchandise categories sequential improvement in comp store sales merchandise margin stabilization and tight expense management give us confidence going into the second half of 2015.
As a result we reaffirm our expectations for a low double-digit growth rate in revenue and a high-single to low double-digit growth rate in diluted earnings per share for full year 2015 as compared to full year 2014 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.88.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph Castner to review in more detail among other things performance of our Cabela's CLUB.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</strong> Thanks Tommy.
For the quarter we realized growth in several key merchandise categories sequential improvement in comparable store sales and strong performance from Cabela's CLUB.
We continue to be pleased with our next generation stores and have opened seven new stores year-to-date including Fort Mill South Carolina; Berlin Massachusetts; and Garner North Carolina in the first quarter.
Sun Prairie Wisconsin; Fort Oglethorpe Georgia; Ammon Idaho; and Moncton New Brunswick Canada in the second quarter.
For the third quarter we expect to open stores in Noblesville Indiana; West Chester Ohio; and Oklahoma City Oklahoma.
And in the fourth quarter we plan to open the final three stores for the year in Huntsville Alabama; Bristol Virginia; and Calgary Alberta Canada.
We continue to identify new store opportunities for 2016 and have announced 10 stores to date including Lexington Kentucky; League City Texas; Centerville Ohio; Farmington Utah; Woodbury New York; Short Pump Virginia; Ottawa Ontario Canada; Abbotsford British Columbia Canada; Avon Ohio and the new store we announced this morning in Summerville South Carolina.
For the quarter Financial Services revenue increased 14.2% to $124.9 million.
The increase in Financial Services revenue was primarily due to a 19.3% increase in interest and fee income and a 7.6% increase in interchange income.
Average active credit card accounts grew by 7% in the quarter to over 1.9 million.
For the quarter average credit card loans increased by 12.9% to approximately $4.3 billion.
Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased 13 basis points from the year-ago quarter and were 1.80%.
Additionally we continued to see favorable trends in delinquencies.
Greater than 30-day delinquencies were just 0.68% as compared to 0.65% a year ago.
Greater than 60-day delinquencies were 0.39% as compared to 0.36% a year ago and greater than 90-day delinquencies were 0.20% as compared to 0.18% a year ago.
During the quarter we decreased our reserve for loan losses by $1.2 million as compared to a reduction of $3.7 million in the same quarter a year ago.
For full-year 2015 due to continued portfolio growth we expect to increase the reserve between $5 million and $10 million for the full year.
Last week we completed a five-year term securitization in the amount of $400 million at Cabela's CLUB.
The securitization transaction included $240 million which accrues interest at a fixed rate of 2.25% per year $100 million which accrues interest at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 67 basis points and three subordinated classes of notes for $60 million.
With our accelerating store growth plans we expect full year 2015 capital expenditures to be between $425 million and $475 million.
Cash flows from operations is expected to be between $275 million and $325 million.
Therefore as we've previously discussed we have received a commitment for a private placement transaction that is expected to be executed in August.
We expect to draw $250 million in August and $300 million in December with maturities of $100 million in five years $250 million in seven years and $200 million in 10 years.
Interest is expected to be paid semi-annually at rates of 3.23% for the five-year maturities between 3.70% and 3.82% for the seven-year maturities and between 4.01% and 4.11% for the 10-year maturities.
In addition to use for general corporate proposes we expect to use these notes in the repayment of unsecured notes for $250 million at 5.99% interest due on February 27 2016.
Now let's turn to inventory.
Inventory increased by 12.2% or $98 million year-over-year to roughly $900 million.
Over the same period we have grown retail square footage by 15.3% with 13 new stores opened since Q2 2014.
Additionally we're very comfortable with the quality of our inventory as we prepare for new store openings ahead of us in 2015.
Our second quarter effective tax rate was 34.1% as compared to 35.4% in the same quarter a year ago.
The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the mix of taxable income between the U.S.
and foreign tax jurisdictions and a tax credit for research and development.
These decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by changes in unrecognized tax benefit and a deferred tax item and an increase in our state effective tax rate.
Our full year 2015 tax rate is expected to be between 35.5% and 36.5%.
Before turning the call over to Tommy let me remind you of a few details pertaining to our 2015 expectations.
For the full year 2015 we expect to have incremental incentive compensation expense of slightly more than $30 million compared to full year 2014.
Recall third quarter 2014 operating expense benefited from the reversal of incentive compensation that was accrued in the first half of 2014 and in the second quarter we recognized negative incentive compensation expense of $11.8 million.
As a result we expect this to be an operating expense headwind in the third quarter of 2015.
I would like to point out one other item that does not impact consolidated income or earnings per share.
In the second quarter of 2014 our merchandise business received an additional license fee from Cabela's CLUB in the amount of $11 million.
This license fee increased profitability in our merchandising segments and decreased profitability in our Financial Services segment.
In the first quarter we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program designed primarily to offset shareholder dilution resulting from the granting of equity-based compensation awards.
As part of this program we purchased 1 million shares of common stock in open market transactions in the second quarter.
Recall 2015 is a 53-week year.
This extra week will be recognized in the fourth quarter and we expect to add $60 million to $70 million of merchandise revenue.
The Financial Services revenue is not impacted as this is reported on a true calendar year basis.
As Tommy mentioned we reaffirmed our expectations for the full-year period with an expected third quarter headwind of approximately $90 million with incentive compensation which will be partially offset from expense management initiatives already in place.
We expect third quarter of 2015 dilutive earnings per share to be approximately $0.05 to $0.10 lower than the third quarter of 2014 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.81.
Now let me turn the call back over to Tommy for some final comments.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong> Thanks Ralph.
While our second quarter performance was not as strong as we had anticipated we are pleased with the many positive trends we see in our business and remain confident in our full-year expectations with opportunity to drive record performance in the back half of the year.
Before turning it over for questions I want to sincerely thank our outfitters for their commitment and passion in cherishing and delighting our customers every day.
Well done you guys.
With that operator let's open the call for questions.
Thank you sir.
And we will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal.
And we will take our first question from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse.
Okay thanks very much.
Hey guys.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Hi.
I wanted to dig into the cost reduction efforts you talked about.
I know that's been a focus for you over the last year.
But what are some of the incremental buckets you've identified here? And just wondering if you could quantify the ultimate opportunity and the timing of some of those benefits? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well Seth we're not – I'm not prepared to give you the – all of the details right now.
They will be forthcoming at the appropriate time.
Suffice to say it is enterprise wide with the intent of streamlining our organization to simply get better at a lower cost.
And as we're in a position to share greater detail we will.
But it involves a real comprehensive look at how we run the business.
And I think it's going to result in meaningful savings this year into next year and into year after that are recurring savings.
Okay.
And understanding that there are some cost headwinds coming up here when would we expect to see some of those cost offsets start to hit is it late in Q3 is it more into Q4 where we could see some of that? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> It's probably – this is Ralph.
It's probably more into Q4.
There'll be some slight savings in Q3.
But as I said in the call I think I misspoke on the call.
But I think on the script I said the second quarter it's actually the third quarter.
We've got a big reversal of the incentive compensation a year ago.
So some of them will offset that.
You'll see more in the fourth quarter but probably a lot of the meaningful savings will come in 2016.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> And we will call them out for sure.
Okay.
And then just one final one.
Just in terms of the discounts can you just help us understand the promotional strategy? It's obviously a topic that's come up the last couple of quarters.
You seem to be a little bit more confident that you can pull that back to achieve slightly – I guess flattish margins in the second half of this year.
Can you just talk a little bit about the strategy? Which categories do you feel like you've had to be a little bit more aggressive and help us bridge the second half? Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
I'll be glad to.
First of all in the second quarter the margin degradation was divided into two parts.
About two-thirds of it was our more aggressive promotional posture.
The balance of it was just the mix headwinds which I think everyone understands from hard goods being strong guns coming back power supports being very strong.
But on the promotional side it was really across the entire complex and it was more price sharpness than extra promotions.
So we didn't ramp up a bunch of new promotions and the reason we did that was that the second quarter is by far our lowest seasonal revenue period.
There is not a lot being hunted certainly fishing and camping are in play but we really wanted to protect our market position knowing that in the back half of the year we've got a lot of good things going for us.
Our vendors are very supportive in the back half of the year.
We think the sequential improvements that we've seen in categories like men's casual that almost pulled out a comp in the second quarter and that's an ongoing sequential improvement that's occurred over multiple quarters.
So we just really wanted to protect the second quarter and we were slightly more price promotional across the whole complex.
So has that changed here...I'm sorry.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
And I would add Seth that as the third quarter has unfolded we have seen less margin compression thus far in the third quarter as we had expected.
So less price promotional in the third quarter.
And as I look into the balance of the third quarter and the fourth quarter we learned a lot last year in the fourth quarter and probably left margin on the table unnecessarily.
I think we're wiser this year.
So I think we feel better about margin stabilization and we've certainly seen way less degradation thus far in the third quarter and we're almost four weeks since so hope that helps.
Thanks very much.
And we will now take our next question from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo.
Good morning guys.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Good morning.
First question was on new store productivity.
Obviously it's a little bit of accrued calculation because we don't know exactly when the stores open and there are different sizes.
But it looked like it was down a little bit sequentially.
Just wondering if you can comment on that? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
Let me – let me break it into kind of a couple of components Matt.
First our next generation stores that had been opened a year through the end of the second quarter they continue to do great.
We're trending at the 40% to 50% above legacy in sales and profit per square foot and that's been very consistent as we reported.
Interestingly our Outpost stores accelerated their performance in Q2 from Q1 levels and the Q1 levels were better than prior period.
So we continue to see this really amazing and delighting improvement in our Outpost store performance.
The stores that we opened in first quarter and second quarter were a little bit soft softer than we had expected but the trends as they have stayed opened on balance are improving and we feel good about those markets and those locations.
And I guess if there is anything we've learned in the last five years is that how a given store opens as witnessed by the Outpost you really don't know where you're until at least a year 15 months 16 months 17 months later.
So we still love those locations.
They did start a little bit slower and we'll keep you posted.
We've got some more coming in the balance of the year and we like those locations.
Okay.
And then I guess on a similar topic can you comment at all on the cannibalization impact in the quarter? There's been a lot of talk about that.
If I recall some of the stores that are experiencing that will lap or will come out of the base in the second half and then I'd love if you could just give us an update on that? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Yeah this is Ralph.
Cannibalization continues to be about – in line with our expectation which is about a 100 basis point.
To your point we're seeing on the stores that have opened recently we're seeing a little less cannibalization than we expected.
So I would expect the cannibalization impact to go down primarily as we anniversary stores like the Lacey opening – I'm sorry the Tualatin opening in Oregon the Edmonton opening.
I mean those are pretty impactful from a cannibalization standpoint.
We've just not seen that in some of our recent openings where we would expect cannibalization.
For example Sun Prairie Wisconsin or Berlin Massachusetts.
So the cannibalization has been running in line with our expectations.
And I think there's reason to believe it's going to get better not worse.
Are there new stores that will tick that backup though as you look out to Ohio and some of your other new store openings? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> No I didn't funnel all the way through to 2016 yet but if you look at the 2016 schedule Houston should – League City Texas won't have any implication; Lexington Kentucky will have some impact on Louisville; Farmington Utah will have some impact on Lehigh.
I mean those are the ones that I kind of call out.
The one in Ohio and Cleveland is quite a ways from Columbus that I wouldn't expect that to be a big deal.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> But Matt you also have offsets with the stores coming transitioning out.
And I think our expectation is it's going to run in that 100 basis point range.
Obviously we'll keep you posted but we think we're right on track and it consistently performed to prior quarters in the second quarter no real change.
Great.
Thanks so much.
And we'll now take a question from Rick Nelson from Stephens.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi guys.
This is Nick Zangler in for Rick Nelson here.
Just to revisit the first margin question I want to I make sure I hit this.
So last quarter you suggested that promotional activity would remain elevated through 2015.
And now for the second half you're suggesting that margins keep pace with last year.
So expectations have changed.
You mentioned men's casual improvement and if you mentioned that you've seen less compression so far in 3Q.
Is there anything else you can contribute to that or does that encompass the change in forecast here? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I think the collaboration with a number of our partners is certainly going to help us and I think the more that we have begun the plan for the fourth quarter which is so important I think we've been able to tighten our thinking up about lessons learned from last fourth quarter.
And so I think we feel really good about that.
But what's really encouraging are these categories in our general outdoors complex which is about 37% or 38% of our business camping fishing power sports and home and gifts all of those categories comp positively in the second quarter and that's a really good thing from a mix standpoint.
It in power sports it's certainly a drag but to see those categories really comp very strongly in the second quarter is an encouraging factor as we look to the back of the year.
The other thing Nick is that if there was ever a doubt that guns and ammunition have normalized and are not kind of subscribing to certain people's cases that they were falling off the edge of the world for us to comp positively in guns and in ammo and in the case of guns it was a mid-single digit comp.
That drives traffic to the complex in the second half of the year if past is prologue.
So we're not going so far as to say we think we can get rate increase but we certainly see enough positive factors to think we got a chance at stabilization to last year in the back half of the year.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
And then on the guns touching on that so looking – you said they were positive for the quarter and looking at the NICS checks just as a reference they were flat in April up about 5% in May and 10% in June.
I'm wondering just the cadence of the gun comp here was it positive throughout the quarter or was it perhaps June that really propelled it into the positive territory? Just looking at for how that trended throughout the quarter and what maybe in particular June that 10% comp or NICS checks that was the highest we've seen in two years.
Was there anything in particular that you could point you that may have driven that? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> We've said so many times I've lost track that we can't find a correlation between NICS data and what happens in our business every day.
There is just a lot of noise in the NICS data.
It's not every state they're concealed carry purchases all kinds of stuff.
So there is no real correlation.
Secondly we've never really given month-to-month comps in guns.
I'll just tell you that our gun business is really good.
And probably no surprise we have some cautious optimism that as we get into an election cycle that heightens interest in these categories.
And if it does it's a good thing for our business.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> I'll just add to that.
We did not see – within the second quarter we did not see volatility in comps consistent with the volatility you just mentioned of the NICS data.
I mean at least relative to the numbers you threw out our comps in the second quarter were pretty consistent and as we start the third quarter we're seeing comps consistent with the second.
There just does not been the sort of volatility that that NICS data would suggest.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you very much guys and good luck.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Okay.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Thanks.
We'll take our next question from Lee Giordano from Sterne Agee CRT.
Hey good morning guys.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Good morning.
Just a couple of questions on the Direct business.
Can you talk a little bit about the mix between cannibalization versus the shift in ammo to retail? And then also what gives you the confidence in the back half of the year that you'll see sequential improvement in Direct.
What are you doing there to improve the business there? Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Lee to give you a bit of context as we said our Direct business was down 7%.
That is only very slightly below our own internal plan.
So Direct kind of performed to what we expected for the quarter.
The ammo shift was by far a significant negative.
But it – for you guys that have followed us a long time when ammo gets in short supply everybody runs to the web to try to find it and as it's come back in stock there just isn't that need to go to anybody's website to buy ammunition we're certainly seeing that ongoing fall off.
Cannibalization was pretty much in line with our expectations which was only between 100 basis points and 200 basis points which is pretty consistent in our prior experience.
So as we kind of look ahead we would expect low-single digit declines and as we are – as we've entered the third quarter we're running in line with that.
So our trends are better in Q3 as we start getting into season and that gives us some confidence that we can be in that low-single digit decline range with obvious cannibalization and the shift in ammo.
Thank you.
And we'll go now to Joshua Reilly from Northland Securities.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi there.
Thanks for taking my questions.
So on the Canada performance it seems like your – the divergence in store performance between Canada and the U.S.
is noticeable.
Is there anything else going on there besides currency and some cannibalization in the Edmonton store? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> By far the major contributor to Canada's drag on consolidated comp is foreign exchange.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> If I had to rank a number two would just be – there was just overall weakness in the broader Canadian economy in the second quarter and the last and of the three the least impactful was Edmonton.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then on the camping business which was a big focus this year as we saw at the Analyst Day.
Is the promotional environment in camping what you expected? I noticed there was some pretty significant promotions from your competitors in the camping space this year? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
It was in line with our expectations.
And again I can't tell you guys how proud we are of the excellent job that our camping teams and our general outdoors teams did in evaluating a market segmenting a market building a product that the customer wanted and then launching it really effectively with Disconnect Day and Cabela's Camp and all those things came together with just spectacular performance from a merchandise standpoint.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then my final question.
Are you making any strategic moves to improve soft goods particularly men's clothing or do you think that the market will just shift at some point? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I think we've been seeing this ongoing sequential improvement in men's casual.
And to get close to a flat comp was you still – you don't want a negative comp but it just scared the hell out of the flat comp.
The bigger challenge in soft goods and not just for Cabela's but our share data would tell us across the whole industry is the softness in hunting apparel in the first half of the year.
And it's hard to tell if it was weather related or are we just in an innovation cycle.
If you' remember in the last several years we launched a lot of new products like Instinct Camo and ColorPhase Camo but we are holding share.
So we're getting our fair piece of the market but that's really where the weakness was and we'll see how it unfolds in the back half of the year.
But it's really not in casual it's more in hunting apparel.
Okay.
And we will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research.
Good morning everyone.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Good morning.
Tommy and Ralph when you talk about the guidance for the rest of the year you are maintaining it and Ralph in indicating you expect the third quarter number to drop you're putting a lot of pressure on the fourth quarter which is often a very promotional quarter.
So how are you thinking about the fourth quarter? Do I have that right that it's going to be really a strong quarter to get to the guidance range for this year? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Well and there is a bunch of reasons for that.
First of all we've got a lot of fixed cost in the first half of the year between incentive comp and new stores.
As we become more retail-centric we just expect the profitability to shift to the fourth quarter some.
We've had to grow virtual (38:15) incentive comp which will be largely behind us.
It's not a huge deal but there is also remember a 53rd week which falls in the fourth quarter which makes that somewhat helpful also.
Although it's only single digits millions of dollars but that's helpful too.
And then you will see some of the cost savings initiatives that Tommy outlined earlier that will be implemented in the fourth quarter that will help to drive some of that out.
So we're confident of our expectations for the remainder of the year.
All right.
Thank you.
No let me go back though you say the 53rd week I meant to ask the single-digit millions of dollars is that operating profit or sales contribution? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> That's operating profit.
We expect the sales to be $60 million to $70 million.
All right.
Got it.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> So I suppose even if you look at our and I probably undersold that a little bit even if you assume that our normalized operating profit of 10% or 9% you still get $5 million or $6 million.
All right.
Thank you.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Okay.
And we'll go now to Andrew Burns from D.A.
Davidson.
Good morning.
I have a follow-up on the soft goods commentary.
Did you see any divergence in trend between the Cabela's branded product versus the national brands? Is there any sort of areas for improvement to get sharper on the private label side? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> None that I – that jump to my mind I think we've been doing a bunch of testing.
One of the changes that we made in our Outpost stores that we believe is a contributor if what our customers are telling us both with their wallets and in focus groups is that our way overbalanced when we envisioned Outpost and launched them to all the store of nothing basically but CAB branded product.
The customer told us hey give some brands too and when we did it certainly appears that that was a contributor to the accelerating performance.
I don't think that's a comment – a negative comment on CAB branded product at all.
I think it's the customer in those small towns don't have a place to buy North Face Under Armour Carhartt Columbia Danner boots and on and on and on.
So we've taken some of those learnings and have tested some I'll call them shops for lack of a better word and in some markets in our next generation stores and we're monitoring those results and – but again I'd just say we're talking about subtleties not shifts in strategy.
Okay.
Thanks.
And on the promotional cadence which has exceeded your expectations over the last few quarters what do you think the root cause of this is? Is it primarily the consumers' ability to price shop online or is it a function of store expansion into competitive markets like the Southeast or what do you think that is? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> We believe it's more just the result of what was a pretty tepid first half across retail period.
That certainly had an impact in our space and against this slightly tepid background I think we just wanted to make sure that we protected and grew share and as we get in the back half of the year I think we believe those pressures mitigate somewhat because we're coming into the seasonal part of our business with a backdrop of guns and ammunitions starting to really perform well and that has helped in the past.
I suspect it will help in the back half of this year to drive traffic.
Thank you.
And we will go now to David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Yeah.
Hi everybody.
Couple of questions.
One is – you talked about cannibalization.
How much do you think that you might be impacted by competitive store openings? Is the plain field getting tougher in that regard? Is that something that you're seeing in your numbers? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> David there was no meaningful change competitively from what we've been saying.
If anything it would appear that there has been a softening of new store announcements or outright cancellation of prior stores that had been announced that now won't be opened by a few of our competitors but we'll see but no meaningful changes in impact from competitors.
Thanks Tommy.
And then my second question is are you satisfied with the level of – entry level point price point merchandise right now in your mix? Do you feel like that you have enough of that out there in today's environment? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I do.
And furthermore one of our strategies that we articulated at Analyst Day if you recall was the idea of explode the middle to really be solid value in the middle price points.
We've got enough opening price point product to get people in the door.
And again with guns and ammo improving that should create traffic opportunities if it in fact continues.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
And we'll go now to Stephen Tanal from Goldman Sachs.
Hi guys.
Thanks a lot for the question.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Sure.
New store performance is one area that I think kind of surprised me a little bit to the downside.
And you mentioned that a couple of the openings or some of the openings in the first half were a little bit softer.
Can you tell us which store specifically you're referring to? And what do you think is going on there? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Well I'm not sure we want to identify the specific stores that have opened soft or strong.
And as far as what's going on there I just think we've learned that – and I can point back to several examples it takes a longtime to measure success and we'll continue to look at these stores.
We still feel really good about the locations and we'll move forward look at – and by the way a lot of this is in the case with Outpost stores is we have learnings after the stores open from both the merchandise perspective and marketing perspective and we'll continue to test different ideas down there and see what works.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I think Stephen what's encouraging is to see the trends improving in those stores as time is unfolded.
Got it.
Okay.
And in terms of comps by region is there any divergence or anything worth noting there or is it pretty steady across the country? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Well I'll jump into that.
It's not steady across the country and they all have their own reasons for it including we had the same trend that I called out in the last quarter that some of our Northern stores that rely on Canadian traffic if there is a common regional theme that's it and I wouldn't say that's a huge factor on the total comp but those stores did tend to be down.
Understood.
Okay.
And just lastly if you don't mind sharing the breakdown of traffic ticket that would be helpful.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
I'll be glad to.
Just to be clear we don't measure traffic we measure transactions.
In Q1 transactions were down 2.4%.
In the second quarter they we down 2% and ticket was up 1.1% in the second quarter and I don't remember what ticket was in the first quarter.
We can get that to you.
All right.
Thanks a lot guys.
I appreciate it.
And we'll go now to Mark Smith from Feltl &amp; Company.
Good morning guys.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Good morning First off Ralph can I just confirm at the end of your commentary you said you expect third quarter to be down $0.05 to $0.10 versus prior year? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Yeah which was $0.81.
Okay.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> The $0.81 was so far your EPS number.
We expect to be down $0.05 to $0.10 from there.
Okay.
Okay.
Excellent.
And then...
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Largely as a result – I'm sorry mostly or entirely due to that incentive comps that we had a year ago.
Okay.
And as we look at merchandise margins you still expect you guys said that they should be fairly flat or closer to flat here in the second half.
Well that maybe a little more heavily weighted to fourth quarter rather than the third quarter on merch margin? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Probably yes.
Okay.
And then just looking at new store growth as we look at your lineup for new stores we don't anymore what we – I guess used to call Outpost stores.
It looks like in the calendar other than maybe Halifax in 2017.
Do you have plans – is there opportunities to look at a 60 000-ish square foot store in some markets? And kind of what are your thinkings right now on a little smaller store? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> So we've talked about this.
We absolutely think there is an opportunity for a 50 000 square foot store that we're in the design phase on and I think the learnings that we've gotten from our Outpost stores give us confidence that will work.
But that probably won't – we probably won't open one of those until late 2016 or early 2017.
Okay.
And with the most recent Outpost openings Ammon and Moncton you did – were those part of the cause of maybe metrics being a little light here in the first half? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Well first off all – and I don't want to give a lot of specificity on stores.
We don't think of Moncton as an Outpost store interestingly enough it's doing really well.
Ammon was a store that was – at least disappointing to our original model but we're going to put a lot of the learnings in there we have had in the other Outpost stores which by the way the Outpost stores from a comp perspective I wish we had more of them because they are clearly leading the way from a comp perspective.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
And we'll go now to Peter Keith from Piper Jaffray.
Hi.
Thanks for taking the question.
Good morning.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Good morning.
Tommy I was wondering if you could talk about the promotional cadence that you guys have adopted now over the last year? You've given us a sense for how it looks through the end of this year but I'm wondering if this is now to the best of your visibility is sort of a new normal.
Do you think going into 2016 you'll maintain this or whereas comps get better do you think there is an opportunity to peel back? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I think there are a couple of macro factors that will weigh into future decisions on promotional cadence.
First is just how is the U.S.
economy performing from a GDP standpoint.
If it's stronger that would argue that we would be – there would be less pressure.
If it weakens we and others might have to be slightly more promotional.
I think the interesting factor in all of this is in my career there isn't an example I can remember that when we got into an election a Presidential election cycle that that didn't create heightened interest in guns and ammunition that benefited both the manufacturers and the retailers because as we saw in the last uptick it certainly drives traffic.
Traffic lessens the need to be more promotional.
So those are the two big dynamics that I see but definitely the I mean the last year and year and a half it's been fairly tepid out there and you had to work a little harder to get the business.
Okay.
And maybe to contextualize it a little bit if you were to pull back do you think on promotions do you think that then it becomes a headwind to sales or are you – you would do it at a point when it's relatively neutral? Could you kind of walk us through the thought process there? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well certainly one of the reasons to get significant cost out of the business is to perhaps not only allow for the leverage of expenses but potentially to create dollars that can be invested in price and promotion.
Not a one-for-one trade off because if you get cost out you certainly want to take some of it to the bottom line.
But the more cost we can get out of the business it helps to mitigate the risk that you propose.
Okay.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> And that's in our thought process obviously.
That's helpful feedback.
One just maintenance question for Ralph.
Could you give us the marketing fees that were passed on to Retail and Direct I missed it if they were given? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I didn't give them.
I've got the change here and not surprisingly because the one-time payment a year ago they're both down.
But in Retail they were down almost $4 million in Direct they were down $5 million.
Okay.
Thanks a lot guys.
Good luck.
And we'll go now to Patrick McKeever from MKM Partners.
Thanks.
Good morning everyone.
Just on – you mentioned just guns and ammunition and the strengthening trend there and how that should bode well for the back half of the year as we move into the fall hunting season? So I'm just wondering within hunting is there anything that stands out on the product side that might be a nice catalyst for the fall either in apparel or elsewhere? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> No...
Newness innovative product that sort of thing? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
We have a really – it's a probably the most innovative Duck Decoy design since the Mojo Duck years ago.
I mean the realism of this moving Decoy the wings actually flap instead of just spinning like they do in a Mojo Decoy.
This looks like a real duck flying into the decoys.
That is going to create a lot of excitement.
On the gun side not a lot of real innovation in guns this fall.
There are some things here and there but nothing that I would call breathtaking in innovation but just this heightened interest again will certainly help us.
And then within power sports which continues to be very strong are there any specific callouts there in terms of products that are doing well and what are the key products that are driving power sports and how do you expect that to trend? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> We haven't seen any real abatement in the strength in both boats which have been very very strong and we continue to build our business in Wildlife &amp; Land Management.
It's still relatively small.
So it's not impacting consolidated results in a major way but we also see the spillover in high dollar marine electronics.
And as we've said in prior calls it's clearly a function of good product but very very inexpensive perhaps even free financing that is driving big ticket sales in that part of our business much like you see the car business has been really strong for a couple of years.
It's spilled over into high dollar boats at Cabela's and tractors.
Got it.
Okay.
Well.
Thank you Tommy.
I appreciate it.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Sure.
And we'll go now to Jim Chartier from Monness Crespi &amp; Hardt.
Crespi Hardt &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi.
Thanks for taking my question.
You mentioned that the promotions had subsided a little bit in third quarter to-date.
I'm not sure if I missed it but how are comps trending so far in third quarter? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> I made a comment earlier that said they were consistent with what we saw in the second quarter.
Crespi Hardt &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thanks.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> With less margin – with less margin degradation.
Crespi Hardt &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
And then within the promotional activity was the promotional activity in second quarter related primarily to the apparel and another soft lines and how are promotions in the firearms and ammunition categories? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> No Jim.
It was across the entire complex.
It wasn't focused in any one category.
We were just a little sharper kind of everywhere.
Crespi Hardt &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then just on thinking about the second quarter results and the reiteration of guidance the press release are those kind of offsetting maybe a slightly lower than expected results in second quarter is that how we should think about them? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well there was no savings from the cost reductions.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> No no no.
What he is saying that the ...
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> The second quarter miss offset the additional expense reductions.
I can guess that's a – that is a way to think about it.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yes.
Yeah.
Crespi Hardt &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> And I know you don't want to get into the buckets of the SG&amp;A savings? But anyway to kind of quantify it for us for kind of fourth quarter what we should expect the incremental savings to be? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> I think the way we just talked about it is at least would be reflective of our expectations this year with probably a little more cost savings with that.
Crespi Hardt &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thanks.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> The cost savings would be – the cost savings would be meaningful in 2016.
We will have some of them implemented this year.
Crespi Hardt &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
Thanks.
Now we'll take a question from Kristine Koerber with Barrington Research Associates.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi.
A couple of questions.
First with regard to the omni-channel obviously you are pleased with the strong traffic via mobile.
How are conversion rates via mobile? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Well there – I mean they are lower.
And we talk about this a lot I mean they are clearly lower than they are on desktop but there is also more coming in the top of the funnel just because it's so easy to access on mobile than it is on desktop.
Inc.</span></strong> But are you seeing improvement in conversion via mobile? Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</span></strong> Yes.
We are seeing an improvement.
Mobile to mobile we're seeing improved conversion yes.
And we're also seeing I mean all of our trend – yes we are seeing conversion improvement mobile &amp; mobile.
We're obviously seeing huge lift in traffic and pressure on consolidated conversion because of the shift to mobile which is the same reason why we're seeing the big shift the uptake in traffic.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay got it.
And then as far as ammunition the in-stock levels kind of where do you stand without already closed to being back to normal at this point? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well Christine it's Tommy.
First of all welcome back.
Inc.</span></strong> Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I want to add one other comment on mobile.
In retrospect one of the better decisions that we made was to really make the big investment needed to have and optimize mobile device and that decision was made years ago with an investment of a whole lot of money and as we look at our business today with this just amazing movement to mobile devices.
I can't even imagine where we would be today if we had not made those decisions.
Secondly we believe our conversion rates on mobile are much higher than any of our competitors and we also think that the money that we've spent on digital to include mobile and SEO and all those other things have just truly widened the gap in a big way between us and any of our direct competitors.
Now to your ammo question essentially ammo has come back into stock.
Rimfire ammunition could be a little bit better but we probably always say that.
So any outages we see now are just normal run off the mill.
In fact ammo out of stocks are down 730 basis points compared to a year ago.
So that's a significant improvement.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then just lastly I'm curious as far as guns and ammo category did you – looking at it regionally were there particular regions that were stronger during the quarter? Was that across the board improvement? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> No it was just improvement.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
And ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's question and answers session.
I would like to hand the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong> Thank you all very much and we look forward to talking to you again soon.
Chief Financial &amp; Accounting Officer</strong> Well I was wrong about one thing...
And ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference and we do thank you for your participation.
