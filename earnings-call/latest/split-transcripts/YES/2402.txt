I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Thank you Kathy and good morning everyone.
At a recent Investor Meeting I was asked what factors I consider to be important in leading a successful global company.
I shared a number of thoughts including the need to ensure that we as the executive leaders understand the dynamic nature of the business avoid the risk of isolation from the marketplace and travel regularly to review our businesses and meet with the members of our worldwide team.
Pete and I are here with the entire management committee to review our operations and the execution of our strategies across Asia our largest and fastest growing region and where 6 of our top 10 markets are located.
As you likely read in our press release Mead Johnson delivered exceptional sales growth of 22% on a reported basis in the second quarter or 18% measured in constant dollars with strong performance in both operating segments.
Non-GAAP earnings was $0.72 per share up 14% from the prior year came from both strong sales growth and robust gross margins offset in part by growing investments in demand generation operating costs to support our growth and a higher effective tax rate that Pete will address shortly.
Turning to our 2 operating segments I'll keep my comments brief and focus on key performance highlights.
Sales for the Asia/Latin America segment grew by 30% on a reported basis and 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
China and Hong Kong continue to lead sales growth in this segment.
The majority of our growth in China came from market share gains and in our established cities.
While we project strong growth continuing in China we do not expect to continue to gain share at this rate indefinitely given the competitive nature of the market.
Our emerging market growth story isn't based on China/Hong Kong alone nor indeed solely on our strong Asia performance.
In Latin America nearly all our markets are growing at strong double-digit rates.
I recently returned from a visit to Peru and Columbia where Mead Johnson holds the #1 and #2 positions respectively.
And where we are confident of being able to deliver sustainable growth driven by favorable economic and demographic trends and the proven strength of our business model and strategies.
In the North America/Europe segment second quarter sales growth was 8% on a constant dollar basis up from 5% in the first quarter.
There are 2 key factors behind this increase that are important to emphasize.
First the second quarter of 2010 was the lowest quarterly sales level of the year for this segment and reflects the period before the launch of key product innovations in the U.S.
Second in the second quarter of this year we saw a point or 2 of sales growth from pipeline sales as more U.S retail outlets adopted our newborn product and the value box refill system.
While we are greatly encouraged by the improvement in our year-over-year U.S.
market share we remain concerned by the continuing decline in the market.
We have not yet seen any convincing signs that the U.S.
birthrate has bottomed out.
Indeed since our last conference call the Center for Disease Control issued provisional data for the second half of 2010 that showed a further birthrate decline of over 2% versus 2009.
While that's a lower rate of decline then the 4% drop in the first half of 2010 the most recent information we have through April comes from the number of infants enrolled in the WIC program.
And that shows a continued drop in participation.
A sign that overall birth in 2011 may be lower by a further 2%.
So the bottom line is that we expect tough market conditions in the U.S.
for the remainder of 2011 and into 2012.
Finally while our market share performance is in large part due to the success of innovations remember that our key competitor in the U.S.
faced a significant product recall starting in the third quarter of 2010 resulting in increased demand for Enfamil.
Though we face a much tougher sales comparison for North America/Europe in the second half of the year our competitor has already recovered some of its share loss.
Nevertheless we continue to expect that our product innovation will contribute to higher share in the second half of 2011 than we reported prior to their recall.
Turning now to our full year outlook.
Our strong performance in the second quarter leads us to increase our sales and EPS guidance for the full year.
We now expect annual sales to grow on a constant dollar basis by up to 14% versus the prior year with another 3% from foreign exchange.
We expect to see annual sales growth in the very high teens in Asia and Latin America and low single digits in North America/Europe.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.75.
This reflects an improved sales outlook but also the headwinds we face in the second half from higher dairy and commodity costs along with our continued commitment to invest behind our strong sales momentum and to support sustainable success.
I will now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights and I will return to wrap up and take your questions.
Thanks Steve and good morning everyone.
It's evening here so I'll limit my remarks to a few additional points on our financial results and outlook.
All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP figures.
First we delivered a 22% increase in reported sales in the second quarter with 18% constant dollar growth and 4% from foreign exchange.
Please note that there was no benefit from currency on our bottom line in the quarter as gains from the remeasurement of our balance sheet added about $0.03 to earnings in 2010.
On a full-year basis we expect currency to add 3% to sales growth.
As you can see in our press release the 18% constant dollar sales growth from the second quarter was driven by a 17% from volume and 1% from pricing.
Steve addressed the key drivers of our strong volume growth so I will focus on pricing in my remarks.
The 1% price increase for the company was fully expected and reflects in part a returns reserve for our year [ph] operations as we completed the transition from Bristol-Myers Squibb to wholly independent distribution.
It also is the result of the timing of promotional programs in some markets this quarter along with a lower level of support in Asia and the U.S.
in the second quarter of 2010.
In particular please note that promotional spending in the U.S.
market did not increase in the second quarter versus the first quarter.
On a year-to-date basis price increases have averaged 3%.
Most of this has been associated with a carryover benefit of price increases taken last year.
In the second half price increases are expected to again fall in the 3% to 4% range on average but will largely result from new rather than carryover pricing.
We announced a 4% price increase for the U.S.
effective August 1 but we're cautious that this early date on how much of this will fall through to benefit our bottom line in 2011.
We remain committed to balancing our premium price strategy with our need to offer a competitive value proposition to consumers in a weak U.S.
economy.
On a full-year basis our expectations for pricing have not changed since last quarter's conference call.
Pricing is estimated to contribute about 3% to growth on average in 2011 with the majority of the increase coming from Asia and Latin America.
Our gross margin of 64.7% was roughly in line with the first quarter and an increase of 120 basis points versus the second quarter of last year.
The solid performance versus 2010 is driven by a number of factors including better fixed cost absorption from volume growth along with a favorable country mix.
One mix example results from increased market share in the United States.
The share gain is coming from our non-WIK U.S.
business which generates one of the highest gross margins in the company.
On a full-year basis we expect gross margin to be around 63.2% down from the 64.6% in the first half.
We have seen significant increases in spot commodity prices for dairy packaging and select agricultural products over the last 6 months that will flow through our cost of goods sold in the second half of the year.
Our full year gross margin estimate has slipped by 10 basis points versus our prior guidance.
This reflects a further increase in North American dairy prices over the last 3 months as milk exports from the United States to Asia had picked up.
Conversely some dairy prices in Asia and Europe have moderated slightly but the net impact is the slight headwind to late year gross margins compared to our earlier expectations.
Also note that manufacturing productivity remains on track to deliver savings of at least 3% of cost of goods sold.
That goes a long way toward helping us to offset commodity price pressures and allows us to maintain full year gross margins close to the level seen in 2010.
Operating expenses in the second quarter were 40.2% of sales up from 37.9% in the first quarter and 39.2% in the prior year.
Focusing on a sequential comparison operating expenses grew by $34 million versus the first quarter.
We significantly increased advertising and promotion spending and also made further investments in sales force expansion research and development and marketing including the launch of our new U.S.
social media app called ExpectingBaby by Enfamil.
Expected moms can now track and share their experiences with family and friends via Twitter and Facebook during their pregnancy.
Several other factors contributed to higher expenses in the second versus the first quarter including an increase in our stock-based compensation expense which was fully expected.
You may recall 2011 is the first year since our IPO that we have a full complement of equity awards in place.
Also at work were higher performance-based compensation accrual from strong sales and profit growth increased distribution expenses driven by higher fuel costs and the initial funding of the Mead Johnson Nutrition Foundation whose mission is to help support the world's most vulnerable infants and children.
While there will be puts or takes in any individual category of spending operating expenses during the third and fourth quarters as measured in dollars should be within striking distance of the second quarter run rate.
As a result we anticipate total operating expenses on a full year basis at about 39.7% of sales 20 basis points higher than our previous guidance.
We are pleased with the returns we're seeing on our demand-generation investments and we'll continue to invest more dollars on strengthening sales.
Advertising and promotion spending should run about 14% of sales for the full year.
During the second quarter we successfully went live with our new SAP platform in both Latin America and Europe.
We now have more than half of our business operating on SAP and the rest will be completed by the end of the year.
We continue to expect some leverage from general and administrative expenses when we move into 2012.
Turning to taxes.
Our effective tax rate or ETR for the quarter came in just under 30% compared to 24.8% last year.
Remember that we reestimate the full year projection each quarter and have to true up our year-to-date numbers accordingly.
That introduces volatility into quarterly tax rates and drove this unfavorable comparison as the second quarter of 2010 was unusually low.
On a full-year basis we expect an ETR between 29% and 29.5% up from 28.6% in 2010.
Strong growth in countries where we repatriate earnings back to the United States thereby subjecting them to a 35% tax rate is the driver here.
Turning to our balance sheet.
Cash at the end of June stood at $704 million.
We repurchased about 460 000 shares of our stock in the second quarter bringing our year-to-date buyback to 860 000 shares consuming $54 million in cash.
Capital spending and depreciation and amortization expense for the full year remain unchanged at $125 million and $75 million respectively.
We entered into a new 5-year revolving credit facility in June.
This was a good deal for us increasing our revolver capacity from about $400 million to $500 million extending the term to 2016 and reducing our borrowing rate about 100 basis points relative to the prior revolver put in place at the time of our IPO.
Our strong cash flow in combination with this facility provides the company with excellent liquidity.
You may recall that we unwound $200 million of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a gain of about $17 million in late 2010.
In mid-July we unwound the remaining $500 million in swaps for an additional gain of about $24 million.
By unwinding the swaps we effectively locked in their appreciated value or limited any future exposure to higher floating interest rates and now have a portfolio of only fixed rate notes.
The gains from unwinding our not recognized upfront but over the remaining life of the underlying notes.
As a result net interest expense should increase by $3 million in the second half of the year versus the first half.
Finally let me wrap up with a summary of our latest EPS guidance of $2.70 to $2.75 per share up from $2.62 to $2.70 per share the last time we spoke.
Higher sales growth is the single biggest factor at work with constant dollar sale expected to grow up to 14% compared with our prior estimate of 10% for the year.
Foreign exchange is currently estimated to add another 3 points to sales growth.
Our revised estimates also incorporate gross margin of 63.2% down 10 basis points versus our previous estimate largely reflecting further dairy cost pressures in North America.
Operating expenses of 39.7% up 20 basis points driven by higher demand-generation investments distribution costs and incentive accruals among other factors.
Taxes are expected to run between 29% and 29.5% slightly higher than our previous forecast on earnings mix and higher interest expense of about $3 million in the second half of the year.
With that let me turn the call back to Steve.
Thank you Pete.
Once again I'd like to thank my Mead Johnson colleagues for their commitment and their efforts throughout this quarter's strong company performance.
We look forward to seeing many investors and analysts at our investor conference to be held in the suburban Chicago on Thursday October 13.
The theme will be next steps for growth and our executive management team will share some additional perspectives on our markets and our strategies.
I will now turn the call back to the operator and ask that the line be open for questions.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Crédit Suisse.
I'm just trying to understand the back half guidance though for North America.
Your guidance for the year is for -- you said very low single-digit growth for North America.
By my math volume could be down as much as maybe 7% in the back half and that assumes that your price increases are kind of -- I guess kind of slow to come through.
So can you help us understand like the pace of the flow-through of the pricing in the back half for North America and whether volume is looking to be just on a tough comparison down that much? Sure Rob.
In terms of the price increase to 4% we have not counted on very much of that actually benefiting us in the second half of the year.
The actions of our competitors still aren't fully understood.
We'll be anxiously following that during the coming quarter.
That forecast actually has -- we believe we're going to come at around 3% to 4% top line growth for the segment in the quarter.
And if you look at sequential run rates that would imply the second half sales would be down roughly 3% versus the first half.
So that's a -- that would largely be volume driven.
One one quick follow-up.
You've said on most of these calls that you've been getting a lot of market share gains in these Emerging Markets and that we shouldn't count on those gains being necessarily sustainable.
But you've also been investing in these markets massively.
You've put in more advertising.
You've expanded your sales force.
So given all that reinvestment is there -- what what makes you think that these share gains might not be sustainable? Are you seeing something from your competitors that they are coming back as well? Rob the reference I made earlier was specifically to China.
You'll probably be able to figure out from our press release and from this call.
You'll be close to an accurate estimate of the growth that we've achieved in China and you'll be able to compare that with what you're seeing for category growth.
And you'll be able -- I'm sure you'll be able to figure out that we have achieved some very significant market share improvements in China year-over-year the majority of which have come in our existing markets rather than our set train [ph] cities.
The China market is intensely competitive.
Yes we're investing there both in advertising promotion and in sales force expansion but we're not alone as you fully understand.
And it would be unexpected for us to continue to grow share at the rate that we're currently growing.
But clearly we will target and expect to continue to grow share.
And you could probably hold the share at a minimum of what you've achieved so far? That would be right.
Your next question comes from the line of Terry Bivens from JPMorgan.
Just following up on the Rob's question a little bit.
Denoun [ph] this morning talked about the Chinese formula market and they did make the comment that indeed you guys were gaining share but they also tilted that remark towards the super-premium segment in the Chinese market.
Is there anything different -- I mean most of us are familiar with your business over there but has anything changed in regard to the super-premium segment over there from your point of view that might account for that? I haven't read Denoun's [ph] remarks.
But as you know the vast majority of the market in China is the premium and super premium prices.
It's somewhat subjective as to how you define those categories.
But I think what Denoun [ph] is referring to is the growth of brands like our Enfamil A+ their equivalent brand and some of the equivalent brands both of international and local competitors.
The consumer understands that those brands offer by and large the highest standards of science and they perceive them to offer the highest standards of quality.
I emphasize that's more perception than reality because we operate to global quality standards.
But I don't think there's anything significantly different Terry.
But we'll read their remarks and let you know if there's anything that we understand from that that would help you.
And just one quick follow-up.
Obviously the balance sheet is looking very very good here.
Some people would say underleveraged.
You've talked about possibly adding on some bolt-on properties probably overseas.
You've also talked about considering the new drying facility over in Asia.
What do you think we're most likely to see this year just in terms of how you use that balance sheet? And that's it for me.
It's hard to predict the timing of any particular acquisition Terry as I'm sure you're aware.
And if one comes through this year or next year the decision with regard to the new spray drying facility in Asia is one we'll make before year end this year.
So we'll announce that as soon as we're in a position and we've made the decision.
Your next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron from RBC Capital Markets.
LLC</strong> I wanted to just ask a follow-up question on China.
There's been some talk some headlines about some competitor pricing actions over there.
Can you comment about that in any way in which you have or have not responded in terms of your own pricing? One of the lessons that I think companies have learned recently in China is to be very careful about talking about their pricing intentions anything that could be interpreted as signaling prices.
So I won't talk specifically about our plans.
As you know the Chinese government is sensitive to high inflation and the resulting social pressure it may create.
It was reported in the China newspapers that the government met with multinational companies including Mead Johnson.
But in our category we believe they're much more focused on food safety and quality and we are partnering with them on those topics and establishing the right standards.
They did raise potential price controls several years ago but they didn't materialize for our industry.
And the last comment I would make is yes we have heard that some of our international competitors talked price when they recently launched some new innovations.
LLC</strong> And then just as a follow-up on the operating expenses.
You seem pretty intent to really not show leverage there even though you're capable of it.
I'm just in the process of reinvesting back into the business.
And Pete I guess I was just wondering is there a point where just you kind of get enough top line to where you drop more of that through? Yes I think there is.
Our goal is to try to drive EBIT at a faster growth rate than we are at the top line sales.
I think it's difficult this year for us to do that in any significant way because of the SAP implementation and the one-time costs that we're seeing which are not in our non-GAAP but also the shared service cost that we're putting in place.
But I do think moving into 2012 that would probably be the greatest source of leverage for us.
At some point too you could argue you might -- you should see it in -- potentially at sales force expansion et cetera.
But we still have wonderful organic geographic expansion opportunities and I think we'd like to continue to pursue those.
So things like sales force and advertising and promotion are not likely to be a source of EBIT margin expansion moving forward.
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Just a question on 2 markets China -- Hong Kong China and Brazil.
If you could just -- given the rate the higher rate of inflation and I guess the concern about the effect on consumers in general in both of those markets do you have a volume like a market volume growth rate right now as it stands in both Hong Kong China and Brazil? And I guess what I'm after is has volume growth or consumption growth -- is it still holding? Or has it accelerated? Has it declined? I'm trying to get an idea of what's happening with consumption growth just for the market.
Let me start with Brazil where we saw excellent growth in the second quarter.
We've always had our Sustagen brand which is a children's supplement nutrition supplement which is growing we believe slightly ahead of the market.
And we're actually picking up pretty good share with our Enfa infant formula offering as well at this point.
It's still in its very early stages.
But the market there might be growing a little bit less than us but it's not that big of a differential at this early date.
China the market is not growing anywhere near as fast as we are.
As best we can tell.
We're very careful -- we have to be very careful looking at -- the only data that's available Bryan is really the Nielsen data.
And that would indicate I think over the last quarter that growth for the industry may have slowed 1 point or 2 on that order of magnitude from 10 to 8 7% something like that which wouldn't be unexpected given what the government is trying to accomplish there in terms of controlling inflation et cetera.
But we still feel pretty positive about the market overall and the growth in that market moving forward.
So to be clear that's dollars sales growth or volume growth? That's value.
Value yes.
Because I guess I've had the impression that especially in Hong Kong and China the actual volume growth consumption growth in the market is maybe low single digits at best? I don't believe that's true with Hong Kong.
But you got to be careful too because I do think that there's been some pickup in the rate of product flowing across from Hong Kong into China.
So we would prefer to look at the markets on a combined basis there.
But I do think volume growth is the driver of the slowdown that you mentioned.
Maybe I could just add that we are prepared to sort of share with you the available Nielsen data for the market in both of those geographies.
But we would do so with considerable caution.
Remember that both for China and for Brazil the Nielsen coverage is weak.
And so as you look at that data do so with caution.
Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA.
Could you just talk a little bit about that market the China market is fairly fragmented but obviously dominated by multinationals.
Could you -- are you driving out the local producers? And then also could you update us on where you stand in terms of the geographic that you have? I think at first quarter you were a little bit ahead of plan.
Could you talk about kind of where you are on the incremental markets for 2011? Yes I'll take that Diane.
We had a full presence which means we had sales and marketing resources on the ground and were spending advertising and promotional dollars in 193 cities at the end of last year and we expect to add an additional 50 cities by the end of this year.
Our product reach is about 1 000 cities.
So when we talk about 200 today 250 by year end I want to emphasize that's where we fully resource [ph] those cities.
In the last quarter I can tell you that 90% of our growth came from established cities and only 10% from those that we've entered in the last 12 months.
And so we're seeing growth both in the market and particularly in our market share even in those established cities in which we've competed for many years.
I'm sorry Diane can you remind me what the first part of the question was? Who do you think you're taking share from? Is it mainly from any local Chinese producers or are you taking share from other multinationals? We've taken share year-over-year both from international competitors and from local competitors.
Because the China market is still growing strongly I think you will hear almost all companies talk about achieving growth.
But clearly we believe that our business model our brands our products our brand proposition and particularly the way we execute with excellence is giving us an advantage.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank.
This is Rohini Nair calling in on behalf of Eric Katzman.
Just a few quick questions.
Looking at that 10% volume growth in North America would you mind breaking out for us how much of that growth is attributable to the benefit you received from your competitors' recall versus the impact of the new products? And then could you just briefly address also your innovation pipeline looking forward and perhaps the timing of upcoming launches? We've obviously seen great growth this year on the back of the recently launched new products.
So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the next introductions and the quality of those products as compared to the recent innovations.
We've talked on previous earnings calls about how difficult it is no matter how much market research you do to determine whether the source of your business and your business growth is linked to your innovations to your sales and marketing programs or to the recall of competitor products.
It's quite clear that during the late third quarter and fourth quarter of last year some competitor users switched across to Enfamil and have remained with the brand.
But we strongly believe that the majority of our share gains and the sales growth that we've reported has come from the very successful innovations the patented Dual Prebiotic the newborn product and the plastic tub refill box value system has clearly driven the majority of those -- of that growth.
I'm sorry that I can't be more specific than that because we don't have that data.
Nobody can provide that data.
As far as innovations are concerned we have a very strong and I am convinced very competitive pipeline that I have visibility into over several years.
But I'd rather you didn't sort of count the number of innovations per quarter because we have led a number of very important innovations not just in the U.S.
but around the world.
And you've got to be very careful not to confuse consumers and confuse the market by introducing change too frequently.
We're very happy with the competitiveness of our product offerings right now across each of the segments in which we operate.
And we will make sure we remain competitive.
I would just add to that.
Keep in mind that 10% volume growth in the second quarter it's probably better to rely on a year-to-date number which is closer to 7% as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks.
We did see a slightly higher growth rate.
Number one because we're comparing of a weaker base last year in the second quarter for the North America/Europe segment.
And number two we did have a point or so of sales growth 1 percentage point or so related to some pipeline fill as we've had more retail outlets except our newborn and value box system.
Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma from BMO Capital Markets.
First with China -- with regards to China when you talk to the Chinese government do you get any sense from them that they are trying to prop up local producers or formula? Or is that something they've given up in a way that "Okay let's focus on food security and if that means that super premium international for us are the way to go that's where we are going"? The discussions we have with the government are focused very much around ensuring that the appropriate quality and food safety standards and regulatory standards are developed and applied.
And really we haven't had any discussions with them that extend beyond that.
And as I mentioned a few moments ago it's clear that they're being vigilant around food inflation generally.
But not specifically in our category or for our brands.
So do you think that the local producer will come back into the market pre-melamine recall? Or is that market not to be had on internationally? I want to emphasize that really only one of the local competitors went out of business as a consequence of the melamine crisis.
There have been shared shifts but in aggregate.
The local competitors still have a substantial share of the China market.
It's clear that Mead Johnson and 1 or 2 of the other international companies have grown share since the melamine crisis.
But I do want to just sort of dispel the idea that we're driving the local competitors out.
I mean that clearly is not happening and many of the local brands are actually growing in share at the expense of some of the other local brands.
Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen from William Blair.
I just have a quick question on pricing in the U.S.
Given your commentary that you're really not counting on much benefits in the back half from the 4% increase I think the actions as you've said competitors are unclear at present.
I mean is there -- do you have a sense that -- or maybe you had some moderation of pricing power in the category in the U.S.
which may result in more structural pressure on margins.
I just appreciate any thoughts on that.
Jon at this point I wouldn't draw the conclusion that there is necessarily going to be pricing pressure coming in this category.
It's just a little early for us to make a comment on how much they're going to go after and what near-term promotional programs may be put in place by any one of the competitors in the marketplace.
It's lack of visibility as opposed to a concern that we won't be able to get it.
Thank you operator.
And with that I'll conclude our second quarter earnings call.
I thank all of you for your engagement.
Thank you for your participation in today's conference.
This concludes the presentation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a good day.
