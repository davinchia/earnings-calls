Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr.
Philip Asherman President and CEO of CB&amp;I.
Thank you Mr.
Asherman.
You may begin the conference.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</strong> Good afternoon and thank you for joining us as we report Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron's results for the third quarter of 2015.
With me today is CB&amp;I's Chief Financial Officer Mike Taff who will discuss the company's overall financial performance.
But first I would like to focus on our commitment to safety.
We worked more than 107 million hours in the first nine months of 2015 on literally hundreds of projects around the world and recorded six-lost time incidents primarily non-severe at an incident rate of 0.01%.
One of the best if not an industry standard for contractors oil companies subcontractors and general industrial companies when benchmarked against the Construction Industry Institute's index.
And we have 31 sites that have worked a million hours or more where that was zero lost-time incidents.
Two particularly outstanding project records include Ecopetrol's Reficar project in Cartagena Colombia which has surpassed 110 million work hours without a lost-time incident.
And the MOX Project at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina which has surpass 25 million work hours without a lost-time incident.
Now our safety record is a key reason we continue to be an employer of choice in the industry with the proven ability to hire and retain skilled workers.
In the last week CB&amp;I announced that Westinghouse will acquire a nuclear construction business.
The transaction is well documented in the press release and the 8-K filings last week.
And I'll leave it to Mike to add color to the accounting.
But I do want to say this is a great point of transition the project to Westinghouse.
Both projects have accumulated millions of man-hours without a serious injury.
The nuclear culture and quality standards as required by the NRC are firmly at place at both sites.
Where there is union labor we have been successful in working with the building trains – building trades to maintain a productive and talented workforce.
And we've achieved many important milestones and the rebased line schedule and cost projections have provided a credible pathway to the completion of both projects.
Now it's rare in our industry to find a solution to a complex issue of this magnitude for each of the parties involved wins.
And we view this transaction as a positive reset for our shareholders the licensees Westinghouse and ultimately the people of South Carolina and Georgia.
Now let's turn to the third quarter results.
New awards totaled approximately $4 billion.
We booked almost $10 billion in new awards year-to-date and our backlog of almost $30 billion includes the $450 million negative impact from adverse foreign currency translation due to the strong dollar.
Income from operations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis for the first three quarters of 2015 totaled $801 million a 10% increase over the same period last year.
For the quarter we generated revenues of $3.3 billion which also includes a $290 million negative foreign currency impact.
And CB&amp;I's adjusted net income for the quarter was approximately $164 million or $1.54 per diluted share.
Now during the quarter we announced an early works agreement with a joint venture between Axiall Corporation and the Lotte Chemical Corporation for an ethane cracker to be build in Louisiana.
We also announced the signing of an early works agreement with Lotte Chemical for the adjacent monoethylene glycol unit or MEG which is derived from ethylene.
As an important raw material for industrial applications such as polyester fibers films and fabrics as well as polyethylene used in bottling.
MEG also is important in the production of antifreezes coolants de-icers and solvents.
These projects combined are estimated at nearly $2 billion.
Other key awards for the third quarter include a $300 million Storage Tank Award by Sunoco for the expansion of the Marcus Hook industrial complex in Pennsylvania.
$100 million award by a major chemical corporation for the EPC of a specialty chemicals plant in the Gulf Coast region a contract by Total for our ethylene technology in feed services for a new ethane cracker in Texas as well as multiple industrial and power maintenance contracts.
And we're confident in our ability to convert major prospects into new backlog in the fourth quarter of 2015 and throughout 2016 while sustaining robust margins and maximizing operating cash flow performance.
Our LNG export terminals with Freeport LNG and Cameron LNG are making solid progress as the projects transition to the field.
Additionally we continue to support these two projects and their evaluation of potential capacity expansion.
Anadarko Mozambique LNG is working preliminary plan with us in preparation for final EPC contracts signing by year's end or early January.
The company has stated publicly that they are confident of reaching an FID by the front half of next year so we remain very confident that this important project will proceed as planned and our joint venture is mobilizing to support Anadarko in every aspect of the early works program.
We also continue to see positive developments in petrochemicals.
Our current projects in the Gulf now include our ethane cracker in Ingleside for OxyChem Mexichem.
The Shintech Toyo cracker in Louisiana.
And the early construction works for the Axiall Lotte ethylene plant in Louisiana I mentioned including work for the Monoethylene Glycol unit.
We're particularly encouraged by this development as the first what we expect to be many developments on derivative plants to transform ethylene into higher value products in the manufacturing process.
We also see near-term petrochemical prospects in the Middle East as the region continues to diversify into higher value derivatives.
Specifically Oman Oil Refineries &amp; Petroleum Industries or ORPIC will soon announce the contractor of choice for the first package of the steam cracker in Oman for Liwa Plastics Project using CB&amp;I technology and feed work.
If successful we expect this project to be a multi-billion dollar EPC contract before year end.
We're also currently working on three-combined cycle power plants with an aggregative value of nearly $2 billion on a curved backlog and believe CB&amp;I is well positioned to capture our share of a solid long-term market.
The issuance of the long anticipated clean power plan rule in August supports gas-fired generation as a favorite source of power that is perceived as a low-risk solution.
In our Technology Group after a slow start this year due to economic headwinds in China and a strong dollar elsewhere the technology market is turning around.
Our joint-venture with Chevron had significant awards in the quarter including a heavy oil upgrader award in Thailand a hydrocracker in Russia a delayed coker in India and two large catalyst orders.
We're also awarded the licenses for the Total ethylene project to U.S.
FCC revamp an Indonesian butadiene plant and CATOFIN and OCT expansions as well as major catalyst bookings associated with polypropylene and Tier-3 gasoline initiatives.
The outlook for our technology business is promising.
The refining side of the industry remains more active in both the United States and China.
Heavy oil hydrocracking has a number of strong prospects as do gasoline de-sulfurization projects required to meet mandated Tier-3 specifications.
On the petrochemical side the best prospects are new ethylene plants expansion of international liquid crackers and CATOFIN projects to butanes or propane.
There is also strong interest in polypropylene licenses.
Our capital services operating group has seen a trend towards increased profitability from the past year partly due to the benefits of cost saving initiatives put in place earlier in the year.
Our recent successes in power maintenance and industrial maintenance are good examples of how our customers view the savings and the value we add to their existing facilities.
The strategies we've been putting in place for our capital services business capitalize on CBI's existing relationships and global footprint to broaden our existing services: maintenance environmental and disaster response including continuous Hurricane Sandy clean up and activities associated with the recent severe flooding in parts of the U.S.
Our fabrication services group has a strong backlog as a result of robust sales in ethylene heaters pipe spools and process modules pressure spheres low temperature liquid storage tanks and storage tanks for liquid terminals.
We successfully completed a number of L&amp;G storage and peak shaving projects in China and Australia in the second half of 2015 and we've mobilized on a number of pressure sphere and storage tank projects in the U.S.
Canada Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
North America and the Middle East remain our strongest market for fabrication work moving forward.
Operationally our fabrication facilities have been rationalized and investments made to increase production at reduced cost.
So how is 2016 shaping up? We remain confident in our capacity to maintain and grow our backlog by focusing on the right projects customers and end markets where we have a competitive advantage.
As most of you know we've changed our Investor Day to quarter one of next year so that we can properly assess the impact of some major awards expected before the middle of January and we'll then provide 2016 guidance.
But on a preliminary basis our backlog is expected to grow between 5% and 7% in 2016 with an anticipated burn rate of approximately 35% to 40%.
On an adjusted basis revenue and earnings should grow by double-digits and operating cash flow should approximate net income.
Our total funnels of opportunities for 2016 is around $65 billion to $70 billion of addressable market opportunities which is actually a decrease from the average $85 billion to $87 billion we've seen over the past several years.
The reasons for this decrease should be fairly apparent.
We've given our win ratio in our primary end markets averaging well over 60%.
We still expect to book $14 billion to $16 billion again in 2016.
But the mix is changing as well and anticipated to include approximately 25% to 30% in LNG and 35% to 50% in petrochemical and refining opportunities.
Combined cycle power generation is around 12% to 15% of the total with the remainder spread between fabrication services technology and capital services.
Geographically we expect new awards to be concentrated approximately 50% in North America with Africa and the Middle East dominating the remainder of the prospects.
Relatively few new major projects in Europe South America and Asia-Pacific.
As to our capital allocation plan Mike will provide more details.
But post transaction we expect to accelerate our use of capital for debt reductions share repurchases and growth initiatives throughout 2016.
And as we stated before our debt covenants restrict stock repurchases over $200 million until our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 1.5.
But the initial focus is buying the remaining shares outstanding associated with the 2013 acquisition and this year we purchased over 4.5 million shares towards that goal.
We'll continue to prioritize share buybacks as cash flow builds positive momentum this next year.
Other uses of cash will include the CapEx associated with NET Power and our catalyst facility we're building with our partner Clarient (13:34).
Each investment once up and running will provide an internal rate of return over 40% which will be an important part of our 2017 and beyond plan.
So we expect CapEx for these two investments to total about $35 million to $40 million in 2016.
So let me turn it over to Mike who will report the financial results of the third quarter.
Mike? Thanks Phil and good afternoon everyone.
Let me discuss in greater detail our financial results for the quarter.
Before reviewing our results let me highlight that we will be discussing adjusted balances on a non-GAAP basis which exclude a third quarter non-cash after-tax charge of $904 million resulting from the company's recently announced divestment of our nuclear construction business.
We believe adjusted balances are a better indication of our future operating performance.
As we discussed last week the nuclear construction disposition which we expect to close in the fourth quarter will facilitate the achievement of our capital allocation goals via improved operating cash flows and reduced working capital requirements.
The $904 million after-tax charge for the quarter relates to the write-down of working capital primarily unbilled receivables in our contract in progress account also fixed assets net deferred taxes and goodwill and intangible asset impairments.
We have provided a table with a reconciliation of non-GAAP information in our earnings release and additional information will be available in our Form 10-Q to be filed shortly.
Revenue for the third quarter was $3.3 billion which was unfavorably impacted by $290 million from the strengthening U.S.
dollar versus the comparable period in 2014.
On a constant currency basis revenue was up 7% versus the prior quarter – prior year quarter.
For the full year we expect the foreign currency impact on our revenue to be between $800 million and $900 million.
Gross profit for the third quarter totaled $378 million versus $393 million in the third quarter of 2014 with gross margins of 11.4% compared to 11.6% respectively.
Year-to-date our gross profit reached $1.13 billion versus $1.08 billion in 2014 with gross margins of 11.7% compared to 11.2% an improvement of 50 basis points.
These increases are primarily a result of higher margin backlog and higher leverage of our operating cost.
Selling and administrative expense was $94 million or 2.8% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015.
Year-to-date our S&amp;A rate is 3% of revenue compared to 3.2% in the comparable period of 2014 an improvement of 20 basis points year-over-year.
The decrease is primarily attributable to lower incentive playing costs and savings from our cost reduction initiatives.
We expect our full year S&amp;A expense to be at or slightly less than 3% of revenue.
During the quarter we generated adjusted operating income of $271 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to adjusted operating income of $291 million or 8.6% of revenue in the corresponding 2014 period.
Year-to-date adjusted operating income of $801 million or 8.3% of revenue compares to $731 million or 7.6% of revenue for the comparable period in 2014.
That's an improvement of 70 basis points.
As a result of the charge recorded in the quarter we generated a income tax benefit for the third quarter of $187 million or 20.5% of our pre-tax loss.
Excluding the impacts of the charge income tax expense for the quarter was $69 million or 27.8% of adjusted pre-tax income compared to income tax expense of $85 million or 31.3% of pre-tax income for the corresponding 2014 period.
For the full year excluding the effects of the charge we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range.
Adjusted net income for the period was $164 million or 4.9% of revenues compared to $165 million or 4.9% revenues in the comparable period in 2014.
Year-to-date adjusted net income was $466 million compared to $407 million for the comparable period of 2014 representing a 14% increase year-over-year.
For the quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.54 compared to $1.51 for the comparable period in 2014.
As Phil highlighted new awards for the third quarter totaled $4 billion and exceeded revenues by $679 million representing a book-to-burn ratio of 1.2.
At the end of the quarter our backlog was approximately $29.9 billion including a year-to-date adverse foreign exchange impact of approximately $450 million.
That's comparable to our levels at year-end 2014.
Now let's review the operating group results for the third quarter.
Third quarter revenues for Engineering Construction totaled $1.9 billion largely in line with the comparable period in 2014.
Revenue benefited from increasing activities on our LNG projects in the U.S.
offset by net decreases in revenues on our cost reimbursable projects in the Asia Pacific region and Colombia.
E&amp;C revenue experienced an FX headwind of an approximately $240 million compared to the 2014 period.
Adjusted income from operations excluding the loss related to the nuclear business disposition totaled $153 million or 7.9% of revenue in the third quarter compared to $155 million or 7.7% of revenues in 2014.
Our third quarter E&amp;C operating income reflects an adverse impact of approximately $18 million compared to the 2014 period due to lower revenue resulting from the previously mentioned FX headwinds.
Fabrication Services generated third quarter revenue of $640 million a decrease of $64 million from the comparable period in 2014.
Our third quarter 2015 revenue decreased due to the timing of new projects completion of storage work in the Asia Pacific region and headwinds related to FX of approximately $40 million compared to the same period in 2014.
Income from operations totaled $61 million or 9.6% of revenues compared to $68 million or 9.9% of revenues in the third quarter of 2014.
Our third quarter 2015 results were adversely impacted by lower revenue volumes and net cost increases on various projects in the U.S.
of approximately $13 million.
Technology reported revenue of $118 million compared to $90 million in the third quarter of 2014 an increase of 32%.
The increase was primarily due to higher catalyst volume.
Income from operations for the third quarter was $32 million approximately 27% of revenues compared to $39 million or 43% of revenues for the corresponding 2014 period.
The decrease in income from operations was due to a lower margin mix of work and lower equity earnings associated with our unconsolidated CLG joint venture.
We continue to expect our technology group to achieve operating margins in excess of 30% of revenues for the year.
Lastly Capital Services generated revenues of $617 million an increase of $35 million or 6% over the comparable period primarily due to increased plant maintenance and chemical plant services revenue.
Income from operations for the third quarter was $24 million or 3.9% of revenue compared to $29 million dollars or 5% of revenues in the comparable 2014 period.
The decrease is primarily a result of lower margin mix of work.
Now turning to our balance sheet cash flow and liquidity.
At the close of the quarter our cash balance was $424 million.
During the quarter we generated $21 million of net operating cash flows.
Our year-to-date net operating cash usage of $173 million represents an improvement of $176 million from the comparable period in 2014.
More importantly we expect our operating cash flow performance following the close of the transaction to improve substantially.
As highlighted in the pro forma tables included in our earnings release excluding the disposed business our operating cash flow would have approached $327 million for the third quarter and $707 million year-to-date and operating cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 2.4 and 1.9 respectively.
For the nine months of 2015 we have invested $93 million in capital expenditures repurchased $211 million of common stock that's approximately 4.5 million shares and paid $23 million in common stock dividends.
During the quarter our capital contract position reflecting the combined balances of receivables inventory contracts in progress and accounts payable decreased by $252 million compared to a $132 million decrease in the second quarter of 2015.
In the third quarter our large U.S.
nuclear projects increased their contract capital asset position by $331 million.
We had previously indicated that we expected the nuclear projects contract capital position to remain relatively unchanged for the second half of this year.
However the recently announced disposition of the nuclear business has affected our ability to achieve cash neutrality on these projects in the second half of the year.
We continue to enjoy significant support from the credit markets with over $4 billion of credit availability to support new awards growth and strategic opportunities.
In terms of guidance for the remainder of the year on a constant currency basis we expect our revenues to be within $14 billion to $14.4 billion from $14.4 billion to $15.2 billion.
And adjusted earnings per share to be within our guided range of $5.55 to $6.05.
Given the changes to our nuclear projects operating cash flow expectations we anticipate our operating cash flow for the year to be close to neutral.
In summary we will continue delivering on our capital allocation priorities of maintaining a flexible capital structure and delivering value to our shareholders via sustainable growth solid margins strong cash flows and returning capital to our shareholders.
With that I'll turn it back over to Phil.
Phil? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</strong> Thanks Mike.
Let's open the call for your questions.
All right.
And your first question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Hello Mike.
Michael you might be on mute.
Good evening Phil.
Good evening Michael.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> How are you Mike? Hey Mike.
How are you doing? Well.
Thank you.
So maybe to kind of – on the nuclear transaction Phil as you look back at what the Shaw transaction provided you and given the solution here can you maybe put in context how you felt it went and how it's provided for CBI going forward? And Mike just on the cash flow neutral aspect so there'll be some cash outflows going out with the closure of this transaction maybe you can bring a little more clarity to that.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Mike circle back on the – what are you saying on your first part of your question about the Shaw transaction.
No I was just – given what's happened and where the company is positioned going forward and looking back on how this all turned out with the transactions upcoming how do you feel it all turned out? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> I feel great.
No regrets.
But if you look at the combined company and considering any transaction is a way of growing the company in real terms if you look at just the year prior to the transaction compared to the year after the transaction we went from – new awards from $7 billion to $16 billion.
We went from backlog to $10 billion to $30 billion.
We went from gross profit from $5 billion to $12 billion.
We kept – we lowered our S&amp;A.
We raised EBITDA from $522 million to $1.1 billion.
So I would have to say that the combination of the two companies did what we wanted to do and in addition to add a number of areas that we needed to diversify in and gave us more control of other projects like pipe fabrication and extended our scope to plant maintenance and got us into power generation vis-à-vis the combined cycle.
So I mean we're very pleased with all of that.
As you know we needed to solve this issue with the nukes and we've done that.
And we're only looking forward now.
And we think the combined company is well-positioned to take advantage of everything we see in front of us.
Yeah.
And Mike related to your question from a cash flow standpoint.
As you recall last quarter we talked about the nuclear projects being cash flow neutral in the second half of the year and that on a consolidated basis for the company that we felt we could generate $400 million to $500 million of operating cash flow.
Obviously the game's changed a little bit with this transaction.
The nuclear projects will be a drain for the second half of the year for the third quarter it was about a $300 million drain and we see some additional potential leakage in the fourth quarter.
So as a result I think on a consolidated basis we'll be close to kind of breakeven cash flow-wise for the full year but I think more importantly is to really refer to the pro forma statements that just shows the power of the organization from a cash flow generation standpoint.
Ex this business we just sold through nine months we would have generated or we did generate over $700 million of positive operating cash flow and in the prior year we generated over $1 billion of positive operating cash flow.
So I think that gives the shareholder and the investment community just really a glimpse of what the organization the remaining business is capable of doing on a prospective basis.
Duly noted.
I appreciate that color Michael.
And my follow-up I guess for Phil even though – looking the addressable market and what the opportunities might be going forward given slowdown in total (30:48) cap spending how do you feel about labor and the activity because it still seems like the Gulf Coast and other parts of the U.S.
are going to continue to be pretty strong here going forward.
How – from your position how comfortable do you feel that you will be able to achieve the right opportunities for your labor and for attacking these projects? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> We started talking about that a couple of years ago Mike as you know and you had asked several questions then as had several of the analysts and investors and I think we've done a pretty good job of identifying the labor needs the 20 000 or so direct labor personnel that we would require.
We've instituted a number of training programs throughout the Southeast particularly in Louisiana and Texas.
There have not been any interruptions or delays in our projects as we're going to the field a result of not being able to supply labor.
Now of course we benefited from the downturn certainly in some of the other related industries relative to the services company and the off-shore platforms.
We found that much of the skills that were needed for those types of jobs have migrated to us.
We've – as you know and commented last quarter we tapped into other labor pools recruiting veterans.
We're continuing to do that.
So we see that as a pretty positive thing for us.
We self-perform everything we do.
So we're not going to be dependent on sub-contractors being able to provide labor we're going to provide it and we've seen great response in our advertising in our reaching out to various labor markets and we feel pretty good on the direction we're headed.
Thank you Phil and Michael.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Thanks Mike.
Thanks Mike.
And your next question will come from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Hi Steve.
Hi.
Thanks.
Good afternoon.
Afternoon Steve.
Phil I think you said you anticipate growing both revenues and earnings double digit next year and I know you will give us more detail in January.
But I guess I'm trying to figure out how you get to the double digit revenue growth you are talking about because backlog it sounds like or is flat and bookings it sounds like will be about the range as this year.
So what's going to drive the double digit growth and I guess just to clarify that that excludes the nuclear in both years? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Yeah.
It's all adjusted Steve as you look at that.
And when you look at the double digit revenue growth and I'll let Mike add his color on that as well.
You also got to remember that the phase of these major projects are strengthened in the field where we're going to be generating more revenue.
There is some major projects we're looking at that will get a quicker start than we've had on some of the current backlog.
So it's current backlog in addition to some new work.
Remember it's not just projects we're talking about backlog relative to our other units as well.
So we think that double digits I can't tell you right now whether it's 10 or 12 but it's certainly in the teens and we feel pretty confident that we're going to be able to get there.
So as far as revenue I don't think we're going to have any currency translation issues going to next year.
We try to normalize our outlooks to accommodate for that.
So but we feel pretty confident that we're going to be able to grow the company again by double digits.
Yeah.
Steve I mean I think that the kind of the easy math is you just look at where we're today at kind on a pro forma basis of $22 billion of backlog.
We think that will grow in the fourth quarter and then leading into next year as Phil said some of the large U.S.
projects will have a higher percentage burn rate than they had this year.
I think you just couple that with our normal underpinning work should certainly allow for that.
Okay.
That's helpful.
And then on cash flow looking at it ex-nuclear obviously the $326 million in the quarter was an improvement from the first half.
Can you just talk about what were the underlying drivers of getting to that in the first half and what drove the third quarter I'm really just trying to get a sense of what's the advance payments versus working capital improvement versus just profit conversion? And then how are those different drivers going to play out next year? Well.
It's kind of combination of all that I mean I think you just look at it for the quarter and the year and look at the prior year too we'll share with you 2014 too but I mean the 2014 cash flow we generated was over $1 billion almost equal to our EBITDA on a pro-forma basis.
So it has a lot to do with a lot of these new projects coming on board and so it's really got to say kind of three factors and you hit on all three of them.
The first is really managing our risk.
When Phil and I think about managing our risk especially with new projects it's – as Phil said executing and really signing up for projects that we're capable of executing but also in that is making sure we have very good cash flow metrics in there.
That's something we're really focusing on today in every project we bid.
The second is just kind of getting back to the basics and we've been talking about that for the six seven months I've been here just getting back to basics of managing our working capital.
Timely accurate billing managing our payables managing our inventories things like that.
And then and the rest is really Steve just get down to execution.
So it's a little bit of all three of those things in the quarter and also for the year and we'd expect that to continue into next year as well.
Okay.
Very helpful.
Thanks.
Your next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Hi Jamie.
Hi.
Good evening.
Hi Jamie.
(36:44 – 36:49) CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Did we lose you? Jamie? Okay.
Jamie's line has disconnected.
Your next question will come from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Hi Tahira.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi folks.
How are you? We're fine.
How are you tonight? Inc.</span></strong> I'm doing well.
Thank you.
I just wanted to get some more visibility on the petrochem projects on a regional basis and get your thoughts around some of the margins that some of your customers are seeing today and how they play into their long-term decisions? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> When we look forward into 2006 the – clearly the concentration of the petrochem projects are in North America.
I mean aside from the ORPIC job that I mentioned as a potential project for this year which is a huge investment most of these projects are in the neighborhood of anywhere from $500 million $700 million to well over $1 billion and again they are concentrated heavily in North America.
I think what's interesting is what I said about the mix changing.
When we look at addressable markets we see the overall universe if you will shrinking somewhat for all (38:10).
But I think where we saw last year heavy concentration in LNG and upstream and remember LNG for us is more than just export terminals it's peak shavers it's tanks it's import facilities.
There is a lot of LNG around the world.
But even having said that we've seen a reduction in the opportunities set for LNG going forward but we've also seen a significant increase in the refining and petrochemical.
So if you look at petrochemical I'd say our opportunities are primarily in North America.
If you look at refining it's pretty much spread around the world in terms of all the way from South America to Asia Pacific and some in the Middle East.
So it's a very interesting change in the mix.
We're looking at as this mix will continue to change as we look at more investment going downstream and more derivatives and petrochemicals we'll see that as again more of a changing mix as we go forward into 2017 and 2018.
So I think that's really the point we're trying to make is that that mix is changing and we seem to have a pretty good position as we move forward.
Inc.</span></strong> Phil also dynamics of all these market have changed.
Is it a change in terms of how you're looking at what technologies to invest in or do more maybe – acquire along the way? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> You're absolutely right.
Because especially as the market lose more downstream the ability to provide a technology a relevant technology certainly increases our competitive advantage in securing EPC and other services.
Because – again when we get the EPC we also can sell fabricated pipe and we can provide tank and storage too.
So with layers profitability in all these projects and again technology is key to that.
So we're looking at that we're looking at various collaborations and certainly our own technology expertise to make sure that we're very well prepared for that change in mix.
Inc.</span></strong> Got it.
Thank you very much and congratulations on the quarter.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Thank you.
Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Hey Jeff.
Thank you for taking my question.
Just wanted to follow up on your commentary on LNG.
Can you help us think through the geographies where do you see in trends for LNG over the next three years to five years.
And as a follow up for that the Mozambique project can you just clarify sort of the timing of what you said in your prepared remarks as far as contract by the year-end or early 2016.
And then how does that convert into an FID? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Yeah.
Well let me go back to what I just said in my previous comment.
When you talk about LNG and our company again it's a broad spectrum of LNG opportunities from export facilities as well as tankage and peak shavers and other aspects of LNG.
But primarily North America we see some certainly a couple of LNG opportunities.
Now regardless of what you may read in some of the research reports the LNG activity on these projects are continuing.
We continue to do feed work and study on all the LNG projects in North America that still are on the list.
You can clearly debate when those may get started but certainly they're all very active.
But for us we think there's probably several billion dollars worth of LNG work to be awarded this year around the world some in the Middle East certainly Africa is going to be a major major part of that new award opportunity for us going forward.
Some in the Middle East some in Asia-Pacific in terms of some import facilities certainly in Europe as far as some – again some components of LNG there.
So it's going to be certainly a part of our profile for a long long time.
As far as Mozambique timing again Anadarko had their call last – we believe that was last week and reconfirmed what I had already said that we expect to get to our final EPC contract by the end of the year at that time or at least by 1st of January.
We expect to bring into our backlog our share backlog that we talked about earlier at that time.
Their FID again they're pretty confident.
They're going to meet that goal of first half of 2016.
And we have no reason to believe otherwise.
And are you able to do work between the time you kind of signed the contract and the FID? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> We've been working with them steadily for about a year-and-a-half.
And this is all preliminary works on a paid basis supporting their early works program getting ready for the kick off of that job in earnest.
It's important that we get the EPC contract obviously because then we can start from sort of our commitments for long lead items and start to get the project going.
So that's going to be an important milestone even though it pre-dates the FID again that's a process they go through but still one that we have a lot of confidence that we're going to look go forward and there won't any kind of change in the plan.
And Jeff once we'll get that EPC contract executed towards -- and we think that will happen mid to late December then we would record that into backlog at year-end and that escalates the spin on the project at that time.
That's very helpful.
One more question on margin.
With the sale of nuclear I think the implied margin in that business is about 11% can you help us think through bridge to what are your margin targets going forward not necessarily 2016 but how do you get to pre-sale margins because I'm guessing this is one of the higher margin businesses? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Let me clarify that.
One I don't necessarily envision our margins changing the margin guidance we have for example in E&amp;C is its 4% to 7% and I still see us being towards the upper end of that as we've been for last several quarters.
And I'm glad you asked the question.
The other thing to clarify that 11% business you mentioned over half of that was the amortization that margin fair value liability account.
So basically that kind of non-cash account and so it was all profit no revenue.
So that business was really about a from a normal operating standpoint 3% 3.5% business and ongoing was what – what it was executing it.
Thank you very much.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Thank you.
Your next question is from the Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> You're back? I'm back.
And this question was asked I apologize because obviously I got disconnected.
But Mike ....
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> She's gone.
Okay.
And she has disconnected.
Your next question will come from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Vishal? Hello? Vishal go ahead.
You might be on mute sir.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> I'm not on mute.
All right.
Your next question will come from Robert Connors with Stifel.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Hey guys.
Since we don't have the queue in front of us.
So I was just wondering what the fixed price mix is in the backlog and if you hit this $14 billion to $16 billion award number for 2016 will that change substantially be flat year-over-year or what you are expecting? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Yeah.
Well again that fixed hybrid type of backlog also considers our steel-plate structures business as well as project business.
We've been running 50:50 or so up until this past year we anticipate 2016 to be more of a 60:40 split in terms of 60% of hybrid and fixed price contracting versus 40% of other.
Yeah.
And actually – the backlog actually with the transaction our fixed price/hybrid actually goes down probably about 6% to 8% from that standpoint.
So from a backlog standpoint at year end you're probably looking – or at the end of this quarter as well as year end you're probably looking at that fixed price hybrid being somewhere between 65% and 68%.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then the $13 million of cost increases on U.S.
projects.
Can you give some further detail on that where they're at on percent complete and what exactly happened there? That was just – I'd say it was several projects I mean I'd say it's not unusual when you have $100 million plus projects there that you'd have some project movement.
So I'd say not one particular project was instrumental in driving that.
I do know that one of the – one big project was at 90% plus complete where we had some cost increases.
So I'd say nothing alarming there but just in aggregate it did kind of move the needle just for that particular business line.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thank you.
And your next question is from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.
This is my last time.
Can you hear me? Yes Jamie.
Go ahead.
I'm at least persistent.
Yeah.
I'm sorry if I've missed a couple of things because I've been trying to dial back in.
A couple of questions Mike just on the cash flow for 2016 any more – I know your cash flow ex the divestitures have been positive.
But any color any more granularity you can give from 2016 and in particular what can be generated from the core business and just what customer advancements and when do you think you can get to the level of the 1.5 times debt to EBITDA? And then just my second question when you're talking about growing EPS double-digit in 2016 on an adjusted basis what is your adjusted 2015 number that we should use as the base? And then my last question is as a result of the divestitures are there any cost opportunities that we can think about? Thanks.
From a cash flow standpoint as Phil mentioned we think 2016 will be at a minimum operating cash flows would equal a net income cash conversion ratio of 1.0.
Now obviously in 2014 again when you just look at the remaining business that was well north of two times and year-to-date we're at about 1.9 times.
So obviously looking at...
Which is why I'm sort of asking about 2016 I would hope 2016 could be better? Well better than 1.9 times or two times that's a tall task.
But I do think it will be at a minimum equal to net income.
But we'll certainly – history shows you that we're certainly capable of being better than that.
You ask about our adjusted EPS for 2015.
I think when you look at the pro forma we indicated year-to-date about $0.92.
I think for the full year that $0.92 turns into somewhere between $1.15 and $1.20.
I think for 2016 what we are thinking these businesses would've given us is probably in the $1.05 to about $1.10 range.
Okay.
And then last – are there any opportunities on the cost side just with the divestitures? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Yeah there are.
Clearly there's a whole structure infrastructure in Charlotte and elsewhere regarding the power unit and as soon as we finish with the transition plans we'll certainly see some cost reductions.
My favorite metric: for the money we're saving on outside attorneys I can train about 120 veterans every month.
So that's one of the more positive capital allocation plans I have.
But no we're going to see some cost reductions.
We've been down that path for the three years and I think for the three years we've gotten about 189 out of the business.
And certainly with the divestiture we're going to see some further reductions.
And I'm sorry one Mike.
Did you answer when you think you can get below the 1.5 times sorry I am calling from my cell.
Yeah I think we'll certainly start making meaningful progress next year and I think it's probably over the next 12 months to 18 months in all.
Okay.
All right.
Great.
Thanks.
I'll get back.
Yeah.
Thanks.
And our final question today will be from the line of Andy Wittmann with Robert W.
Baird.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Great thanks for taking my...
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Hello Andy.
Hi Andrew.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Mike so I think on the – I'm curious on how the deal affects the cash flow here in the waning days or months.
You mentioned that it kind of affected the cash outlook is that because basically you've stopped work now or are you working for free as part of the terms or how does that affect the cash flow from now to close? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Well I mean it's just – we're still obviously funding the projects and so as you can look back at history over the last nine months these projects have used $880 million as you noted in the pro forma.
As much as I wish that would stop I'm optimistic that we'll do all we can to mitigate that cash usage but I do think that you will see some continued cash usage in Q4 through the closing date of the projects.
But no the work continues these projects have not demanded any shape form or fashion so they're still under our control until we close and as I indicated we're shooting for a mid to late December close.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> So you didn't forgo any milestone payments as under the terms of this field or anything because I thought what the setting of some of the major milestones you would have seen some of those cash payments come in.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Yeah.
We were in – Yeah.
We were in the middle of negotiations of major milestones when we came to terms on this deal.
So obviously that will continue but not under our watch.
There may be some conditional payments I mean some additional payments in true-ups that we're going to receive as we go forward and think what we want to present to you was probably the most conservative view on going forward.
Hopefully there is going to be some upside but we are continued to look for any recoveries that are due us before we close this deal.
So standard milestone will continue to get Andrew the ones that we were talking about getting last quarter was moving about $156 million a milestone from 2016 into 2015.
Those are the ones I think will be more difficult.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Yeah.
Okay.
That's not makes more sense.
So then just can you talk Mike what the contract capital is without the nukes? You gets a lot of pro forma's the contract capital balance will be interesting to know as well? Yeah I mean all that will be in the 10-Q and all so it's in a liability position where we have historically run.
When you look back at the kind of days from 2005 through 2012 or so.
We were consistently in a probably a $500 million to a $700 million range of negative contract capital.
And we're in that similar range today.
But certainly can improve on that.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Got it.
And Phil I'm just curious as when you're sitting at the table to do this nuke deal.
If you would consider taking your partnership position with Westinghouse and going to be the sub ala what Florida that seems like a pretty nice contract actually do everything at a reimbursable basis.
Was that part of the consideration side.
Or did you just feel like you needed cut ties and run? CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</span></strong> Historically our role on new jobs going back to the first wake of net wave of nuclear construction was a sub-contractor for the containment vessels as well as the shield building and various supplies.
We felt that probably Westinghouse needed to control this they needed to decide how they were going to proceed with construction and I think it was a good choice I mean they I think it answers the question you're not a contractor it's not your core business.
So you need to satisfy the stakeholders that you're going to be able to control and forecast this job.
So we've left the entire team there and I'm sure the combination of Westinghouse and Florida do a great job to get it through.
But our position was that we're going to extract ourselves from the nuclear construction business and let Westinghouse proceed.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
Those are all my questions.
Thank you very much.
Thanks Andrew.
And that will conclude the Q&amp;A portion of today's conference call.
I'll turn the call back over to Mr.
Asherman for closing remarks.
CEO &amp; Member-Supervisory Board</strong> I don't have any closing remarks except to thank everyone for their time and their participation today.
And with that we will conclude this call.
Once again we'd like to thank you for your participation on today's CB&amp;I third quarter 2015 financial results conference call.
You may now disconnect.
