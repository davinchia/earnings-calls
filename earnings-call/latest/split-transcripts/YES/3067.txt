Thank you.
(Operator Instructions) Thank you.
Our first question is from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Please proceed with your question.
Thanks.
Good morning guys.
I have two questions.
First when you look at your regulatory filing including the decoupling/rate design aspects that you requested has there been any sort of heretofore public commentary from different intervener groups that you could talk about that point to the points of the most contention as we approach the settlement talk date? No Greg.
I – like we said we’ve had stakeholder meetings on a monthly basis and dialogue is generally being good.
I think it’s been a good lively give and take but I don’t think anything pops to the surface that would indicate a ranking so to speak of where peoples’ heads are now.
Okay.
My second question is kind of away from this.
You own obviously the largest operating nuclear facility in the country.
And Don I know that you’re also on the board of Nuclear Energy Insurance Limited.
Can you comment on what you’re seeing in terms of the issues at Crystal River 3 what looks like a near-miss of an issue at Davis-Besse and how that informs – how you’re thinking about the maintenance of your nuclear plant and whether you’re embarking on any construction projects there that we need to be wary of? Well no I can’t comment on Crystal River or Davis-Besse Greg.
But we don’t have any kind of projects anywhere close to anything like that.
We’re doing some construction of like an outage administration building but literally that’s an office small office building within the protected area.
Okay.
So there’s no plans for steam generator or vessel head replacements? No we’ve just completed over the last 10 years 12 years 13 years all the steam generators changed out through the early part of the last decade.
And just completed a year or so ago the last reactor head.
And unique we have a hatch that was built in the containment during construction.
So there was no cutting concrete.
It was just unbolting and opening the hatch.
It’s a big project but there was no cutting into the concrete.
Thanks Don.
Okay.
Hi.
Good morning guys.
Hi Kevin.
I just have I guess a question on energy efficiency.
So I recognize that energy efficiency is typically viewed as the cheapest form of power but those capital costs are often borne by the customers as they upgrade equipment make their home improvements and so on.
But if we’re in a sustained low economy does it seem – it seem like these resources are less available today than they were a couple years ago when these were – when these policies were struck especially now with like a bigger bifurcation between economic classes.
And so Don do you see – do you know if the Commission is showing any interest at all in reducing the efficiency targets to lessen the burden on your customers particularly as those at lower end of the economic spectrum are being affected by base rates resets? Well Kevin we haven’t seen anything out of the Commission in that regard to this point.
And I’ll add particularly during the first few years of pursuing energy efficiency we’re really in the point in time of a lot of low-hanging fruit.
And most of the programs we have in place have besides our subsidies some pretty quick payback periods for customers.
And really it’s been a very favorable response from our customers and the results demonstrate that the programs and processes work.
Okay.
And what sort of programs do you have in place right now in order to achieve – I guess the nearest hurdle right is 9.5% by 2015? Yeah a variety.
Well time-of-use rates weatherization programs pool pump programs air-conditioning rebates for higher SEERs.
I could go on.
We’ve got – you can find most of them on our website pretty extensive.
We think probably one of the most extensive programs in the industry.
Okay.
Thank you.
And I guess on a separate question.
Jim did you say that you’re assuming 1% customer growth from 2011 to ‘14 because I thought you filed for 1.7% in the rate case? On average 1% customer growth yes.
Do you know – I guess what sort of – under a full decoupling mechanism what sort of – have you provided any sort of EPS sensitivity to changes in realized customer growth rates? No.
Okay.
All right.
Thanks guys.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Hey Jim could you remind us assuming you do end up at the higher end of the range as you expect to for the year what would that correspond to in terms of ROE for the utility? It’d be just north of 8.5%.
Okay.
And then going back to the commentary that you made earlier in terms of the discussions that you’re having with all the parties throughout this process on the rate case should one extrapolate that to assume that – we should assume that a settlement is the most likely outcome on this process given what you’ve been hearing from all the parties you’ve been in discussion with? I wouldn’t extrapolate the technical conference into a settlement in the case.
Proposing the mechanisms that we did decoupling the infrastructure tracker these were really avenues to more fully explain and get points of view and clear up questions going into this filing from the interveners.
Okay.
And then lastly can you remind us what was the final outcome of the study of the report that was done on the outage that had happened a few months back has that issue been pretty much resolved or just remind us where we stand on that? Yeah this is Don Robinson.
The September 8th outage is still being reviewed by FERC and NERC and WAC and the California ISO and we wouldn’t expect any results out for many months.
Sometimes beyond your rate case outcome et cetera? Well I can’t tell you when the rate case is going to be done but I think this will be a few months down the road.
Okay.
Thank you.
Yes hello.
Just the property tax trends that you’re seeing it seem that they’ve come in a little bit under what you were expecting a quarter ago.
Is this kind of an ongoing review or is the base that’s reflected in your O&amp;M expense guidance should that be the base that we can now work off of going forward? Well I would answer it this way Brian as we knew in ‘10 we’d have higher rates than ‘09 because valuations were falling.
We knew that ‘11 would be higher than ‘10.
We try to extrapolate that into booking the number in the second quarter and they came in slightly lighter than we thought.
And with the stability in home pricing we’ve been seeing in the last year we could see an increase in property taxes but we think the big run-up is behind us over the last couple of years.
Okay.
And the $475 million of capital investment for the Phase II of AZ Sun should we assume you build or buy 50% of that and the rest of PPAs? No.
The $475 million and the 100 megawatts would be our rate basing similar to what we did in AZ 1.
Okay great.
Thanks a lot.
Yep.
Good afternoon.
Can you comment on your pre-established equity needs in 2012 where we assume a constructive outcome in the rate case? Well like we said before our need for equity will be driven by whether or not we have a settlement because that’ll dictate whether or not ‘12 is a test year.
And if ‘12 is not a test year I don’t believe we would issue equity in 2012.
I think we’ll be issuing in 2013 at the earliest in that regard.
Size-wise we haven’t really talked about size.
I would just point out that Don alluded the sale of APS Energy Services and we continue to sell non-regulated and that would continue to reduce the need for equity at the Pinnacle level.
Any potential upside to your credit ratings assuming a constructive outcome? Well that’s obviously up to the agencies but S&amp;P kept us on positive outlook.
And I think there is potential implication there but we’ve had no dialogue with the agencies directly related to the subject.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hey guys.
Hey Neil.
So as we think about that $44 million transmission rate increase that you received earlier this year how much of it did you take in Q3 and what was the adjustment factor that offset part of that in the quarter? The increase in Q3 was $8 billion before the adjustment factor.
And the adjustment factor is just an adjustment to a formula that affected prior years.
Got it.
So that was limited to Q3 the adjustment but on a go-forward basis it won’t be a factor? It won’t be much of a factor that’s correct.
All right.
And then on AZ Sun 2 as you think about those 100 megawatts from 2013 to 2015 in your filing did you talk about the distribution of those megawatts when you expect them to come online? Well Neil we did but I would point out that just like we did it ratably in the last one we’ll be opportunistic and you have to do RFPs and you have to find projects that work that have land and the permitting is always an issue as we’ve seen.
So it will be based on really what the market and availability of projects give us over that timeframe.
Got it.
And then on Four Corners can you just refresh us in terms of how you’re thinking about timing.
We’ve still got some regulatory approvals that are contingent.
Are you still targeting late 2012? Yes.
Yes.
And got it.
And I guess those are my questions.
Thank you very much guys.
Thanks Neil.
Thanks Neil.
Good morning.
Hey Paul.
Wanted to just touch base with you on this staff recommendation on the solar incentives and the fact that solar prices have fallen.
Any comments on that any thoughts about how that could affect the proposals you have with the Commission the fall in solar prices? As we looked at the filing the staff pretty much agreed to a request that we had made and actually cut down the incentive piece a little on the residential to recognize the fact that you don’t need as much there.
But other than that we don’t see much else happening.
Okay.
And then with respect to the property tax question that I think Brian was asking about.
Right.
I guess the $0.02; is that – I wasn’t completely clear on that is that sort of an annual impact that we’re going to be seeing in terms of delta as to what you had seen previously or...? Yeah no that’s an annual impact.
We now have our assessments in our bills in for the year so now we do know our bill.
Third quarter we were trying to extrapolate some things we saw from various counties.
Okay.
And then you guys very effectively went over your schedule and I missed part of it; the November 30 and December 23 dates what were those signifying? I apologize for being a little off the wall? Well the November 30 date is the date according to the procedural schedule that we formally start settlement discussions.
That’s since been clarified and said we can start earlier if all the parties choose to.
And we have until December 23 when we’ll either file a settlement agreement in the case or we’ll file rebuttal testimony.
So we’ll be on dual track in that timeframe.
Okay.
Okay great.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you Paul.
Hi good morning.
Good morning.
I noticed that your weather normalized retail usage for businesses has slowed down quite a bit in the last few quarters.
In the first quarter this year you had 1.7% growth second quarter 0.3% growth and then last quarter down 1.9%.
What were the drivers for that and do you think that will continue for the next six to 12 months? Well as I looked at the customer usage before the call I saw no particular industry group or driver for commercial sales.
So I think it’s broad-based and reflective of just the state of the economy in Arizona.
As I mentioned earlier in the call we’ve seen some economic statistics that have been fairly favorable noting that we came from pretty far back and so I don’t expect any real worsening of those sales trends as we move forward.
Okay.
So yeah with your weather normalized guidance of flat for 2011 through 2013 you’re basically assuming that that will normalize and stabilize going forward? Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Hey Ted.
I had a quick question on pension.
One just your thoughts in general about pension headwinds next year given the move in the markets and the move in discount rates? And then secondly I’m remembering I think in 2008 you guys were – had some unique plan where you actually booked a gain where the market was obviously down significantly on your assets.
And I wanted to just know if that the program is still in place and how we should think about the performance of your assets this year? Well there’s no question we’ll have headwinds on pension in 2012 with not only the discount rate but certainly we look at the screen today and know what asset returns are doing.
Now keep in mind we do get to defer a bigger piece of pension in OPEB in 2012 so that it’ll partially offset that.
And then what you referred to in 2008 as we had done – we had executed an LDI strategy on the pension plan.
And at the end of the year when you had very low treasuries very high spreads we ended with a positive return in the pension plan.
In fact I think we had the top-performing pension plan in America that year.
That plan was removed at the beginning of ‘09 to take the gain which – so that plan is only partially in place today and will continue to benefit us but no question we have headwinds.
Okay.
So your returns will look probably more in line with the market than they did in 2008 because you had made a good call back then? That’s correct.
Okay great.
Thanks a lot guys.
Thank you.
Southwest Gas recently received a decoupling mechanism.
I think there’s another gas utility segment that’s in for a decoupling mechanism.
Do you view that as a relevant read over to the commission’s appetite for decoupling for electric? No.
I think this commission has clearly demonstrated the difference between electric and gas companies in the rate setting process and have further delineated growth utilities from non-growth utilities on the electric side as well.
I think the track record clearly points at that.
Got it.
And on O&amp;M expense growth what have you guys guided to for next year? We haven’t.
Okay.
Thanks guys.
