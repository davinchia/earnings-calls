Thank you.
We'll take our first question from Tobey Sommer with SunTrust.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you.
I'm curious if within the quarter or maybe even in the month of October you saw gradual month-over-month improvement and impact in the bookings from the onboarding and flushing out of the lower ranks of the salesforce? Thanks.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hey Tobey.
As Rich said Q3 bookings were back-weighted.
And I don't think at this point we're entirely confident that that was entirely as a result of new staffing adds.
But obviously as these folks come in we're seeing sales pipelines build.
Though as I said we're not all the way to where I'd like to see them be.
Inc.</span></strong> And what has the historic lag been as you've had to ramp up sales folks to eventually see the financial impact in terms of newly generated sales? Because you did talk about how the macro climate is a little bit more challenging.
So I just want to get a sense for what it has been historically and then maybe handicap that for the environment today.
Thanks.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> The financial impact in one sense is immediate in that they immediately cost money.
But in terms of driving sales pipelines remember we're talking about more the kind of key deputies to our senior sales people.
So their ramp to productivity is not the ramp that you'd see with putting a new lead account manager or new lead sales executive into the field.
That can be months and months and months as they build pipelines et cetera and it takes almost more than a year for someone to reach full productivity at the senior level.
More junior folks who are coming in and being supportive have an immediate if modest impact.
And then over time we find their ability to contribute to sales pipeline development is more on the order of months than years.
So we'd expect that – obviously we did a lot of the staffing in Q3 so modest impact in Q3.
We're seeing people ramp into their activity levels in Q4.
We hope they contribute to a good Q4 outcome.
We'd expect to see that value continue to drive into Q1 and Q2 next year.
Inc.</span></strong> Thanks.
Just two other questions for me for Rich.
Is the tax rate that may be lower next year is that going to be an enduring lower tax rate? And then for SHL the conversion to more of a subscription model should we see the top-line impact of that lessen over quarters or is that a multi-year thing? Thank you.
On the first part on the looking ahead to next year certainly we're working on additional initiatives to incrementally improve our tax rate from here.
I would not expect the magnitude of improvement we've seen this year in next year but I think we could see some incremental improvement in the tax rate next year.
And we'll give you more specificity when we get to the call in February.
In terms of the impact of the conversion of subscriptions at SHL I think that's going to be an ongoing impact.
Obviously the pace of conversion of subscriptions will influence that as well.
I would say it's one of the factors that's influencing overall growth in that business at this point but we're focused on continuing to drive the right level of bookings growth in that business which will be the more dominant factor overall as we move forward in SHL.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you very much.
Thanks.
I just want to maybe revisit one of the earlier questions the question about bookings as being back-half weighted.
I recognize you're hesitant to say if it was exactly the new salespeople or not.
But I would imagine you have a feel whether it was the last day of the quarter and people scrambling to get bookings in or if the general business environment whether it was new salespeople or just some other factors that the pace of activity was better as you exited the quarter than what you started the quarter with.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hey Tim.
I think it's too early to say.
And I think we tend to watch what we can control which in order this year has first get great new people in place so that we're fully staffed then ramp them to productivity so we can see their impact on the front end of the sales pipeline.
I think we've done a good job on the first.
On the second we're still in the thick of things there and we're working hard to ramp people to productivity.
And sales pipelines have gotten better but they're not where we would like to see them be.
So we're still working hard to get people productive and see that immediate contribution on the pipeline activity.
I think it's too early to say.
The bookings were back-weighted in Q3.
I think it's too early to kind of tease apart the impact of new hires coming in and supporting us and the way the quarter played out.
Okay.
I guess in general when you say they're back-half weighted do you say that as a good thing or is that a bad thing that they were back-half weighted and you had to scramble at the end of the quarter to get the bookings? I'm not sure which way to take that statement.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think in big simple terms it just is a fact.
I don't know that it has a lot of content they were back-half weighted which you kind of expect always in Q3 due to the summer activities and due to the fact we were staffing.
I don't think they were more back-weighted that we would have guessed.
I don't know Rich do you have any comments beyond? No I mean I think clearly there was lot of noise in the quarter itself both in terms of the fact that we were hiring people onboarding them that we'd had kind of slower bookings growth coming out of the second quarter.
And so certainly we were happy to see some modest acceleration in overall growth as we came out of the third quarter.
And as Tom said we still are working hard to get the pipelines where they need to be not only for the fourth quarter but for 2016.
Okay.
And then the comment about margins in 2016 I guess being closer to the – the lower end of the long-term range.
You had talked before about getting SHL's margins into the low-20%s which is still a fair amount of distance from kind of the year-to-date of kind of 19% so I guess do you no longer expect that or are we expecting that the CEB segment margins could come down next year? I guess just trying to reconcile those.
No I think we still expect and think we're on track to get SHL margins into the low-20%s for the full-year of 2016.
I think it's a combination of just looking ahead and looking as we put our – finalize our plans for next year there may be some investments that we want to make in servicing initiatives in the kinds of things we do to reignite revenue growth.
And so that in combination with given where we are and what the profile of overall revenue growth is likely to look like next year just makes it harder to push towards the higher end of our long-term margin target.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> It safe to say Tim that while we're excited about both the caliber and number of new people we hired you're not seeing their full impact show up in the P&amp;L in Q3 it will start to show up in Q4 and into Q1.
So that probably will limit the rate of margin expansion in the CEB segment.
Okay.
And then just – Rich on the tax rate the 32% to 34% is that kind of the – apologies if I missed it is that a number that can be there for 2016 and when you talk about improving your tax rate was it – or trying to improve it further? Is it relative to that 32% to 34% range? Yeah it's relative to the 32% to 34%.
I think we do see some opportunity to improve further from there.
I think we're still – there's a number of initiatives that are still very much in-flight as we speak and so I'd prefer to wait until we get to the February call before I give you more specificity on that.
Okay.
Thanks.
Inc.</span></strong> Hey thanks.
Sorry I missed some of the – the beginning of the call Rich.
But could you just talk about – it looks like from the guidance that the 3Q growth rate is sort of the trough and growth accelerates into the fourth quarter.
Is that the right read and is that what the guidance communicates? And then I've just got a quick follow-up on the EPS guidance.
Well I think assuming that FX rate stay where they are; I think certainly the FX impact in the fourth quarter year-over-year is less.
So that helps.
That eases the comparison as you look at the fourth quarter on a reported basis.
I think...
Inc.</span></strong> On a organic basis? On an organic reported – on a reported basis.
And so I think certainly we've got the range in place that reflects our current assumptions about where we expect bookings to come out for the full-year.
What the year-to-date bookings impact will be on fourth quarter revenue and the impact of FX as well.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
But I guess I'm focused more on the organic growth rate.
It does seem like you would imply going from roughly 4% toward 6%.
Does that sound right to you and just based on the updated revenue guidance? I think certainly in that range is – if that's what's implied by the range.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
And then just on the EPS guidance change ex-the change you would have raised EPS guidance by roughly $0.34.
Just correct me I think that's correct.
And then just kind of take us through why you would make the change is that – I'm just trying to think are you keeping EPS lower this year for some reason as you look out to next year? Or what was the impetus behind the change? Thanks.
Yeah I think the impetus is just really as we look at the magnitude of these discrete tax items which really non-recurring in the future and the idea philosophically behind non-GAAP EPS is to give you kind of a view as to what the recurring ongoing operating performance of the business looks like.
And so we just felt that – whereas in prior years you saw that that impact was maybe $0.05 or so one way or the other.
When you start moving up into $0.34 then it starts to be really significant and distorts the picture.
So we just felt it's more appropriate to pull that out going forward.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think the headline is the tax story is good news.
In some sense as you make long-term – make progress in the long-term permanent rate the efforts that you put in there yield some short-term benefits that shake out and actually obscure the longer-term progress we're making.
So we just want to separate those two things.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi good morning.
Thank you for taking my questions.
Hey Rich what was the incremental currency impact on 3Q versus expectations at the last call and also for the full-year versus expectations from the last call? So in the third quarter if rates had stayed as we had guided – as we're incorporating in our guidance at the end of the second quarter that was probably a little bit less than $1 million headwind that came about as a result of FX in the third quarter itself.
And then if you take that plus the incremental impact on the fourth quarter you're looking at about call it $4 million on the full-year guidance.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Thanks.
So the difference between on the top end of the lowering – top end of the guidance went down $10 million so should we think $4 million for currency $6 million for bookings? You're just not coming in exactly the way that you would have liked? Yeah.
I mean a combination I mean you think – look part of it is as you get to the fourth quarter kind of the range of possibilities narrows and so there's a little bit of just kind of tightening up the range overall.
And then we have the FX impact we did have a little bit of the kind of back-end weighted of bookings does have some impact on – in particular on third quarter revenue.
And then just as we're looking ahead based on our updated forecast for bookings and revenue activation in the fourth quarter explains the rest of it.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then hey Tom are clients relating concerns that they have that you feel should be concerning to you in terms of trying to sell to them? In other words some of the volatility and the risks that they see are people at all kind of slowing down their own purchasing of CEB product? III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah obviously we have a pretty unique view here just because we sample so broadly across geography function and industry.
We did see the tone of executive conversations change a bit as they digested.
There was some disappointing economic news for markets that are very real for some of our customers and there's some continued difficulty in some sectors.
You've seen this theme show up in Q3 earnings reports.
Obviously from our vantage point we're able to do a solid job connecting our resources to decisions on executive desks.
But where we see it is the types of decisions we're supporting people looking for fast payback ideas little more help in budgeting than they normally get.
We're going to – our job is to make sure that the resources we're highlighting and showcasing and building are pretty tightly linked to the types of concerns they're facing.
We also have to make sure that where front and center is they make key decisions.
You can imagine – we need to make sure we're making the right investments in servicing support so that people can be there to have those conversations and link them to resources.
We think on balance it's a big great opportunity to be of service and impact but we have to be executing our highest standard.
It's not all industry is not all sectors not all geographies but there's definite people looking at some more challenging markets than they had.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then Rich will the lower tax rate change the cash conversion metrics in other words you have pretty good cash conversion as we look at an accelerating booking scenario with lower tax rate.
Should we expect an improvement of the conversion? I wouldn't – the impact would be more just on kind of what you're looking at for overall kind of profitability and how that flows through to cash flow.
I wouldn't think it would have an impact on cash conversion in a material sense.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> If you go down say 500 basis points or so in your taxes why doesn't that just flow into cash from operations? Well again we're looking at – what we typically use as a rule of thumb is looking at operating cash flow as a multiple of adjusted net income being in the 1.4 times to 1.5 times range.
So to the extent you have better adjusted net income as a result of a lower tax rate then – and you apply that multiple through it then that helps.
But it doesn't necessarily change the multiple.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
I see so you're seeing an impact to their earnings but it does not impact the conversion of earnings to free cash flow because it's reflected in the earnings? Right.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And then what's the comp on EPS for 1Q and 2Q as we're looking out to next year? Because you gave us a full – year-to-date and you give us the third quarter but you didn't give us the breakdown of 1Q and 2Q the new EPS.
Yeah.
I mean effectively they were pretty flat in 1Q and 2Q.
I think the – there should be – in our presentation we should have added those into the appendix updated those schedules that can show that to you.
But essentially you had $0.06 in the third quarter $0.06 for the full-year and so there wasn't much impact in the first and second quarters.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Understand.
Wasn't there a $0.34 hit to the first part of the year with $0.11 in the third quarter? So you've got $0.23 should I spread that equally between 1Q and 2Q? That was in the second quarter sorry I misunderstood your question.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> I'm just trying to understand how I should – how should I understand the $0.23 of...
That was effectively all in the second quarter.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thank you.
Hey guys.
Good morning.
I jumped on a few minutes late Tom I missed most of your initial comments.
So apologies if you went into this.
But I've heard a lot of discussion about the sales head count shortfall and getting back on track there.
I didn't hear any mention of the other thing that you blamed a quarter ago for the weak bookings which was delayed closing of complex bundled deals.
It would have seemed that that was more likely to actually get done and get some of those over the goal line.
So can you give us an update on that? And if it hasn't happened why not? III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> As we discussed some of those deals legitimately slipped days and so closed early in Q3.
Others remained active when we moved into the quarter and others moved out to future horizons.
I don't think we saw a net material impact in Q3.
It's a small portion of our overall book of business.
I'd expect to see larger complex deals grow just as we bring together more and more of our selling activities and clients ask us to link products in new ways.
And as we've said there are some broader changes in the selling environment that mean that we and lots of other companies have to get better at managing complex processes.
But I don't think the effect in Q3 was net material one way or the other.
Okay.
So some of that business just doesn't get done? I guess the way I had understood you framing it a quarter ago was your CEB salesforce was unleashed to start getting some compensation or credit for selling SHL too or making introductions and so they did so.
But their CEB sales didn't close because SHL is a lot more complex process.
So did you lose some sales in the core business or did I not quite understand how you discussed it a quarter ago? III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think it's case by case.
There were certain situations where it slipped and we recaptured; there were certain situations where it slipped and we had to go back and rebuild support inside a customer and there are certain situations where we're still working to get it closed.
The scenario you outlined is correct that we have more people engaged in more types of broader cross-selling activities and that will have two effects.
One is open up some more opportunity across time and two create some situations where deals get stuck unless we get out ahead of them faster.
And we see that from our vantage point if you're sitting here with Rich now we see that it's our job to help people be successful there and not any wholesale change in how things operate.
And we're putting in place some management structures and making some tweaks to help people organize to help them be more successful and partner more effectively.
But I don't think it had a material impact one way or the other good or bad in Q3.
Okay.
And not surprisingly based on the bookings the CV per large member customer the year-over-year change there has flattened out.
But what if you looked more broadly and included some of the non-subscription offerings you've been layering in in the last few years whether it's add-on products or some of the leadership academies or other things? Are you growing more robustly? And I ask the question from the perspective of the four folks you had on your customer panel at your Investor Day all sounded like they were using a lot more stuff than they did several years ago.
And I'm trying to understand that dynamic and where that would show up and how that's impacting the growth you're driving.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I'll note that obviously the people at our Investor Day were not selected at random but they are broadly emblematic of a trend you've seen in the business over the last five years which is our larger customers growing a little faster than the overall corporate growth rate which has been a real focus of ours how do we put in place teams and products and people to take advantage of the huge opportunity at the high-end of our customer base.
I think they were emblematic of that broader trend.
This year where we've obviously had some challenges on staffing I think it's safe to say as we talked about when we're gapped on staffing it disproportionately affects our ability to generate new bookings either in the form of new institutions or cross-sells.
I think on balance more of that hits the new institutions new logos front.
But without question the gaps in staffing hurt the team's ability to cover our client well enough to kick open some new doors and create cross-sell opportunity.
So in the near-term the issues we've talked about have affected most of our key metrics on the bookings front.
More broadly that trend of our larger customers doing more business with us is one that we both have seen pretty consistently over time and would expect to see pretty consistently in the future.
Okay.
And then I understand why you're not including this potential acquisition in Canada in the numbers.
But I don't want to have a situation like the winter of 2014 where you did two deals didn't give us a lot of color and missed badly because you were front-loading some expenses et cetera.
So how should we think about if this does go through and gets shareholder approval and government approval et cetera what it would mean to the numbers? It looks like it's profitable but not dramatically so.
It looks like it's had good growth in a small but recurring subscription base of revenue.
Are you going to ramp costs to put this together with TalentNeuron? Or would you expect that we could layer in what they've been putting publicly and that would be a reasonable way to think about it again if you get the deal closed? Thanks.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I mean I think certainly over time it's going to be very complementary to the TalentNeuron business and will help both the growth profile and ultimately the profitability of that combined part of our business.
I think initially certainly there's obviously integration costs that we'll call out separately.
But I do think that we're likely to go in and put some additional resource in place to help make sure it's getting off to a good start and moving in the right direction.
So I think it's reasonable to assume that the profitability of that business would probably move sideways to a little bit down initially before ultimately contributing to better overall growth in the workplace planning part of our business.
So can you quantify what you might spend in the fourth quarter? I just don't want to be surprised.
Would a few million dollars be a likely investment before you start to generate the benefit later? III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think it'd probably be hard to spend that much money in the roughly six weeks or seven weeks that we will have had them on the books in 2015.
I would think 2015 impact would be less than that but we'll provide more color in terms of what to expect for 2016 as we put out our overall guidance for the year.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi this is Ryan filling in for Manav.
Just in terms of the – I guess the market you talk generally about maybe people getting a little bit more cautious and you talk about some of the hiring issues.
So I guess looking out a year from now what gives you confidence that things like the hiring issues won't be repeated and that the market won't disintegrate further? III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think I'd separate them pretty to say – I certainly don't know what the economy will look like a year from now.
I'd say that so far it's a tone issue.
You saw at Q3 earnings reports and there were definite signs of caution.
But it's more about people needing to make more specific choices about where to deploy limited amounts of resourcing.
And so actually we like that sort of environment if we can execute well when people are trying to decide between door number one and door number two where great and cheap resources and making good choices in their budgets et cetera.
The staffing issue is one we are incredibly focused on.
We – job one was getting great new people on the front door.
Job two was making them highly productive and engaged and opening up great paths for them within CEB.
And job three is making sure the strong team we've already got in place stays focused on the market in creating great outcomes.
So we see in many respects we see the economy want as a challenge of making sure that our product set and our servicing are really tuned to the needs of the market.
And on the staffing front it's about being very very focused on making sure that we continue to build on the momentum we've generated.
Inc.</span></strong> And just on that staffing is part of that going to be increased wages? We're obviously seeing a very competitive job market.
Is there any kind of margin impact to hiring and retaining the top talent? III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Assume it's accounted for in the guidance we've put out there.
Absolutely there are definite pockets of – our strong workforce planning products are being leaned on very heavily by our members who are looking for ways to manage pockets of wage pressure in their business.
We have some tools that help us do that.
But there are definite places where we had to be smart about making sure we match market on comp.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay thanks.
And on the buybacks just in terms of pacing did some of that accelerated momentum in the quarter also take place into 4Q? And – or do you think it will kind of go back to more than $6 million a quarter trend you had in the first half of the year? Yeah I mean – I think we're we don't really comment specifically on kind in-quarter buyback activity.
I'd remind you that we put $100 million buyback authorization for a two-year period and I think that represented what our two-year intentions would be overall on the buyback.
Inc.</span></strong> Thank you.
Inc.</span></strong> Thanks.
Just had a follow-up the commentary Rich that you made about a preliminary sketch of 2016 trends is it fair to assume that that also does not include the closing and the pending acquisition? Yeah.
Although the pending acquisition is not going to be a huge needle mover on growth in 2016 just given the size and scale of it.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yes.
Our outlook Tobey is that it's pretty unique to CEB history.
We're tying that right up with a great asset we already have in the space that's doing great.
And so pretty quickly they will become one product line that we plan for and manage as an integrated part of what we do.
So it's not – it won't be – we've already – as we structure 2016 that will be seen really as part of our integrated workforce planning platform.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thank you.
III - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thanks everyone for joining for today's call.
We're obviously pleased with some of the early progress we've made on key priorities.
But as I said we've got a lot of work to do.
We have not restored sales pipelines to where they need to be and that's a real focus of ours right now as we work our way through one of our busiest selling seasons.
The core priorities we laid out are going to remain our core priorities of focus and we look forward to keeping you up-to-date on the CEB story in the final months of the year.
We'll be at the JPMorgan and SunTrust events in November and the Barclays event in December and Rich and I look forward to seeing many of you out on the road in our travels in the next few months.
Thanks very much.
