With that let's start with an opening remark from Sumner.
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the CBS Corp.
event.
Thank you Sumner and good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us.
I'm pleased to tell you today we reported another solid quarter.
Revenue of $3.4 billion was up 2%.
Adjusted EPS of $0.74 was up 6% and reported EPS was up much more to $3.03 thanks to the gain we posted by splitting off our Outdoor Advertising business.
We achieved these results because of the continued growth in our diversified set of revenue sources including healthy gains in content license fees strong underlying growth in affiliate fees and yes higher advertising which will increase even further here in the fourth quarter.
And while advertising revenue grew during the quarter our non-advertising revenue grew even faster and is becoming a bigger part of our results all the time.
In fact the third quarter was the first time that advertising made up less than 50% of our overall revenue.
And year-to-date we have now recorded an even 50-50 split between advertising and non-advertising revenue which is a far cry from the 70-plus percent of advertising that we had a few years ago.
What we are seeing is that the world of content monetization continues to expand across new devices and new distribution platforms.
And as it does we continue to invest in and to produce the best content which in turn strengthens our financial position.
This includes a number of recent developments that give us great confidence in the future.
First advertising is growing again here in the fourth quarter.
Our local businesses have benefited from some tough political campaigns which you saw yesterday culminating in spending that accelerated right up through yesterday's election.
And nationally CBS is once again the #1 network in America and we're up versus a year ago.
In fact we are the only network that is up year-over-year in all 3 key demos: viewers adults 25 to 54 and adults 18 to 49.
We're even the only network that is up 18 to 34.
All that this means we continue to get the first look at scatter budgets and capture the largest share of dollars of all broadcast networks.
And while broadcast as a whole is having a solid season basic cable is not doing as well.
So any share shift towards digital is coming primarily at the expense of cable and print.
Here at CBS as is virtually always the case scatter pricing is being written right now at a premium to upfront pricing.
Another development that gives us great optimism is the series of reverse comp deals that we did during the quarter.
Just like the Time Warner Cable deal a year ago we once again proved the value of CBS this summer during negotiations with the incumbent CBS affiliate in Indianapolis.
They did not want to pay market rates for our programming and so Tribune came in with a significantly better and fairer offer and we did a deal with them instead.
Soon after not surprisingly we quickly followed that up with a series of new reverse compensation agreements first with Gray Television then with LIN and then with Media General.
All of these deals were done at extremely attractive and growing rates.
So once again the free market worked and we're now on track to easily hit our goal of $1 billion in retrans and reverse comp as we exit 2016.
And we are more confident than ever that we'll achieve our goal of an impressive $2 billion in 2020.
By the way our next major deal in this area is with DISH Network.
The end of our current deal is approaching soon and we're determined to get paid fair value for our programming.
As you know by now we know how to get this done and rest assured we will.
The third recent development for us is the successful launch of our very own over-the-top service called CBS All Access.
All Access is additive to the overall ecosystem in that it primarily addresses consumers who are not currently MVPD subscribers.
It offers more top 25 current shows than any other SVOD service.
Plus it enables viewers to watch CBS live and to be counted outside the home.
So we're expanding our reach to new audiences especially younger viewers and proactively taking advantage of the growing mobile marketplace.
I'm also pleased to announce that we just reached a historic over-the-top agreement with Sony for rights inside the home.
Sony along with others who are getting into this space represents yet another iteration of content distribution.
And as new entrants they will pay us higher subscription fees than what we've ever been paid before.
So just like when telcos came along to compete with cable and satellite broadband services will help expand the universe of opportunities for companies like CBS that make the best programming.
All of these developments along with the many other opportunities we have in front of us are why we remain so confident about our future and it's why in addition to reinvesting on our content we are returning more value to shareholders than ever before.
Through the first 9 months of the year we retired nearly $5.5 billion of our stock and raised our dividend by 25% our second increase in 2 years.
And with the expansion of our share repurchase program that we told you about during our last call we have more than $5.5 billion to go.
So there's a lot more to come and returning value to shareholders will remain a top priority.
Now let's take a look at each of our businesses starting with entertainment and then I'll turn it over to Joe for more color followed by your questions.
As I mentioned the CBS Television Network had a terrific start to the new season.
Our new programs batted 1.000 going 4 for 4 with all 4 of our new dramas being picked up for the full year.
The good news is we own 100% of 3 of these new shows: NCIS: New Orleans; Scorpion; and Madam Secretary.
Meaning we have once again reloaded the content pipeline with new franchises that we will monetize around the world for many years to come.
And we continue to beat the competition.
In addition to being the only network that's up in all key measures we also have the #1 drama and the #1 show overall in NCIS; the #1 and #2 new dramas in NCIS: New Orleans and Scorpion; the #1 comedy Big Bang Theory; and the #1 news program 60 Minutes.
Plus 4 of the top 5 prime time shows are on CBS as well as 6 of the top 10 more than all of the other networks combined.
Thursday Night Football has clearly been a great addition to our lineup as well.
Even with the number of blowout games we grew CBS' strong Thursday ratings from a year ago and we nearly doubled the ratings for the comparable games last year on the NFL Network.
In our final prime time game on CBS we beat Sunday Night Football with the highest-ranked NFL game of the week.
This was the first time that a Thursday night NFL game has ever come in ahead of Sunday Night Football.
The NFL continues to be extremely valuable for us on Sunday as well.
This past weekend we have the third highest regular season game in 16 years when the Patriots beat the Broncos.
The addition of Thursday Night Football also allowed us to strengthen our lineup with some key scheduling moves for example by moving Big Bang from Thursdays to Mondays for the first 6 weeks of the season.
We were able to create the perfect lead in for Scorpion clearly contributing to that show's success.
Scorpion by the way provides a good illustration of the growing trend across our industry towards huge increases in delayed viewing.
As you've heard me say and as the facts prove overnight ratings are becoming more and more irrelevant all the time.
Day of air Scorpion averaged 13 million viewers this season.
But after 7 days its average increases by 5 million additional viewers to 18 million all of which are being counted by Nielsen.
And the bigger the show the bigger the opportunity.
Big Bang NCIS NCIS: New Orleans are all drawing more than 20 million viewers when you add in 7 days a week.
20 million viewers week in and week out.
How many cable shows can say that? How many online shows or hits does it take to get that kind of reach in one place? Yes those are rhetorical questions.
I should also point out that the CW which we co-own with Warner Bros.
is also off to a great start.
The debut view of The Flash was the CW's most-watched telecast ever and Jane the Virgin which we own also had a strong debut in one of the most critically acclaimed shows of the new fall season.
Our content continues to be in high demand overseas as well.
We've already begun licensing all of our new owned hits in the international marketplace including Scorpion NCIS: New Orleans Madam Secretary Jane the Virgin and Showtime's The Affair.
We also got a jump-start overseas with our new CSI CSI: Cyber which doesn't debut on CBS until mid-season but has already been licensed in more than 200 international markets.
That is 6 brand-new owned programs that are entering the never-ending cycle of syndication revenue.
Plus in addition to more traditional domestic and international outlets CBS Studios has begun creating original content for SVOD distribution partners too.
So along with all of the content we create and own for CBS Showtime the CW and outside broadcast and cable networks we can now add digital streaming companies to that list as well.
More deals along these lines are coming soon.
At the same time CBS Studios is also expanding into late nights.
Currently our late night shows are owned by Worldwide Pants but beginning next year the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and the Late Late Show with James Corden will be produced and owned by CBS meaning we'll have the right to license these programs in a number of ways we couldn't before.
And as you know late night shows are very popular and highly monetizable on digital platforms.
And in another important development tomorrow CBS News is launching a new streaming service called CBS N that will allow us to take all of the content we create across our news division and distribute it across the leading digital platforms without the costs associated with the Cable News Network.
This service will provide programming 24/7 to a whole new audience and along with All Access demonstrates the way we are following our viewers with CBS content wherever they are.
As digital media expands CBS Interactive is growing at a fast clip too.
Advertising was up strong double digits in Q3 and we continue to post growth in profit quarter after quarter.
Turning to cable.
Showtime continues to be a truly remarkable story for us as well and it is excelling both creatively and financially.
On the creative side our programming has never been better including strong performances by Homeland The Affair Masters of Sex and Ray Donovan which just concluded one of the best seasons of television we've seen in a long time.
And we just announced the revival of Twin Peaks which by the way has been one of the biggest television stories in social media.
On the financial side in addition to growth in affiliate fees we continue to increase our ownership in original programming.
We now have ownership in more than 10 series on Showtime with several more to come.
So in addition to rates and subscribers syndication has become a major driver of Showtime's growth.
Also in cable we announced plans during the quarter to rebrand TVGN our co-venture with Lionsgate.
Beginning in the first quarter the network will be called Pop with more than 400 hours of original programming including 6 new original series as well as a number of shows from our extensive CBS library.
Since we made our investment in this network in 2013 ratings and key measurements have grown every single quarter and we're confident that will continue into 2015 as well.
In publishing we are very pleased with the leadership Simon &amp; Schuster showed in its groundbreaking deal with Amazon.
This was a terrific deal financially for both Simon &amp; Schuster and its authors and it established the strength of our publishing business for the future.
As we look ahead to Q4 we have a number of strong titles still to come including releases from Stephen King Tony Robbins and Mary Higgins Clark.
In local both our television and radio stations had very strong quarters.
On the television side political spending retrans and NFL sales all contributed to double-digit third quarter growth and Thursday Night Football has given a significant lift to our late local news here in the third and fourth quarter.
All but one of our games featured teams from our O&amp;O markets resulting in late news ratings that were 20% higher in our key news demos -- demo of adults 25 to 54.
Looking ahead we're confident that going mobile with CBS All Access will help our television stations continue to grow in the digital future.
Radio also had a strong quarter as we continue to focus on our big market strategy.
Last month we made an agreement with the Beasley Broadcast Group to swap 14 stations for 5 stations exiting some of our midsized markets while building our presence in Philadelphia and Miami.
We own television duopolies in both of these major markets meaning our new radio stations are a terrific complement to our existing local portfolios.
So across CBS the creation and monetization of our premium content continues to drive our results and nobody knows how to do it better than us.
Each call we have with you we tell you about all the new opportunities in front of us thanks to the way we continue to reload our world-class content and this quarter was no different.
We launched 5 new owned hit series across our networks including Scorpion NCIS: New Orleans and Madam Secretary at CBS; Jane the Virgin on the CW; and The Affair on Showtime with the sixth CBS Cyber (sic) [CSI: Cyber] still to come.
All of these shows will be monetized for years to come through multi-platform syndication deals around the world.
In addition CBS Studios is steadily increasing its output of shows that we own by distributing across a growing variety of broadcast cable and now streaming outlets.
We also launched CBS All Access and we're about to launch a new streaming service in CBS News and we're about to begin working with a whole new entrant in distribution thanks to our Sony agreement.
Plus during the quarter we continue to renegotiate retrans and reverse comp deals at much better rates putting us at a clear path to $2 billion in revenue in 2020.
And we've gone mobile with our TV stations have traded up to beachfront property in radio and cut a terrific new deal at Simon &amp; Schuster with Amazon.
And remember once again CBS remains America's #1 network up in every key demo something none of our competitors can say.
Through all this we're returning value to our shareholders like never before with lots more to come.
So we continue to build on our position of strength and we feel more confident all the time about our future.
And with that I will turn it over to Joe.
Thanks Les and good afternoon everyone.
In a little bit I'll give you some more details about our third quarter results and now I'll talk about what we see ahead in the fourth quarter and into 2015.
But first I'd like to give you a final update on our Outdoor initiatives and discuss how we have set ourselves up for continued future growth.
During the third quarter we completed the split off of CBS Outdoor culminating in a gain of $1.6 billion.
The better news is the actual financial impact of our Outdoor initiative has been far greater than the $1.6 billion.
All in we delivered nearly $6 billion of total value.
So we accomplished just what we said we would which is unlock tremendous value for our shareholders and reshape CBS into a company that is solely focused on premium content.
Let me give you some more details about these shareholder returns.
In the first 9 months of this year we have retired more than 90 million shares of our stock.
This represents about 15% of total shares outstanding.
Keep in mind that we were locked out of making any share repurchases for a good part of the third quarter because of the completion of the Outdoor split off.
So the $400 million of cash that we used on buybacks in Q3 is just a starting point and you can expect to see an accelerated pace of quarterly share repurchases going forward.
As Les said we had $5.6 billion remaining on the program as of September 30 and we remain fully committed to returning that $5.6 billion over the next 12 to 24 months.
The other key strategic reason for the separation of our Outdoor businesses was to further transform CBS into a company that is driven by the creation and monetization of the best content in the world.
In many ways the third quarter epitomizes the strength of this strategy.
Our results benefited from the content licensing of our current hit shows both in the U.S.
and internationally as well as higher revenue from reverse compensation.
In fact the 4 new reverse comp deals we made during the third quarter covered 53 stations representing 22% of our affiliate footprint and we have another 45 stations to renew in 2015.
Even more than that as Les mentioned our investment in programming has led to 6 new content franchises that we own including NCIS: New Orleans and CSI: Cyber.
Both NCIS and CSI already represent multibillion-dollar franchises for us and these new spinoffs along with the other shows we launched during the quarter will significantly add to that potentially leading to billions of dollars in profits in the years to come.
Already the diversification of our revenue streams is having a big impact on our results.
The third quarter -- during the third quarter advertising made up just 46% of total revenue and on a year-to-date basis advertising was barely 50% of total revenue.
Now let me give you some more details about our third quarter results.
Revenue of $3.4 billion was up 2% during the third quarter which spread across our 3 key revenue categories.
Advertising grew 2% helped by Thursday Night Football and strong political spending.
Content licensing and distribution was up 4% led by increases in TV license fees and streaming revenues both here in the U.S.
and internationally as well.
And underlying affiliate and subscription fees increased 6%.
Strong growth in retrans and reverse comp offset the difficult comparison to last year when we had the Floyd Mayweather/Canelo Alvarez fight on Showtime which was the largest pay-per-view boxing event of all time.
OIBDA came in at $814 million down 2% reflecting our increased investment in programming including Thursday Night Football.
However SG&amp;A costs were down 7% for the quarter yielding an overall OIBDA margin of 24%.
We also posted EPS growth once again just as we have for the last 19 consecutive quarters.
Let me say that again.
We have posted EPS growth for the last 19 quarters in a row.
And for this quarter EPS was up 6% to $0.74.
It's also worth noting that foreign exchange rates cost us $0.04 per share due to the strengthening U.S.
dollar.
There were also 2 actions we took during the quarter that will result in future benefits.
First we cut costs throughout our businesses resulting in restructuring charges of $26 million and the payback on these cost-cutting measures is less than 1 year.
Next we refinanced high interest rate notes at much lower rates resulting in a $219 million after-tax charge on the early extinguishment of debt.
This refinancing along with the debt we paid off in the second quarter will reduce the run rate of our annualized interest expense by $35 million.
Now let's turn to our operating segments.
In Entertainment revenue for the third quarter came in at $1.9 billion up 1% from last year.
The increase was driven by higher affiliate and subscription fees; growth in television licensing which includes the domestic syndication sale of Hawaii Five-0 and Blue Bloods; and healthy gains in international revenue.
Entertainment OIBDA was $335 million compared with $431 million last year because of the investment we made in programming.
In our Cable Networks segment Q3 revenue of $624 million was up 5% driven by strong growth in Showtime licensing fees from the sale of Dexter as well as Californication.
Plus we posted higher affiliate revenue from increases in rates and telco subs.
All of these gains helped offset the comp of last year's third quarter when we had that big pay-per-view fight which by the way affected our cable revenue growth by 7 points.
Cable OIBDA of $272 million was up 4% for the quarter and our Cable OIBDA margin was a healthy 44%.
Turning to Publishing.
Third quarter revenue was $199 million compared with $224 million last year due to the timing of title releases which we expect to improve in the fourth quarter.
Digital book sales represented 28% of total revenue up 1 point from Q3 of 2013.
Publishing OIBDA of $43 million was even with last year and as a result of lower selling costs the publishing OIBDA margin expanded 3 percentage points to 22%.
In Local Broadcasting third quarter revenue of $680 million was up 6% driven by strong political spending as well as higher affiliate and subscription fees.
TV stations were up 10% while radio was up 2%.
In addition our local digital businesses continue to post double-digit revenue growth.
Local Broadcasting OIBDA of $214 million grew 18% driven by higher revenue as well as lower programming costs.
In Local Broadcasting OIBDA our margin expanded 3 percentage points to 31%.
Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet.
Our free cash flow during the quarter included payments of $360 million made in connection with the debt refinancing I mentioned as well as additional NFL payments.
We expect fourth quarter free cash flow to be much stronger than a year ago.
Our gross debt to OIBDA ratio at 9/30 was 2.1x.
And as we have said before we are comfortable raising our target ratio to 2.5x as part of our capital return plan.
So we still have plenty of debt capacity to utilize.
We also exited the third quarter with $178 million of cash on hand.
Now let me give you a few observations about what we see ahead in Q4 and into 2015.
As we shared on our last call we see revenue building through the end of the year with the fourth quarter shaping up to be our strongest of 2014.
Our TV stations are pacing to be up teens and radio is pacing to be up mid-single digits.
Looking out into 2015 we have some significant deals coming up in retrans and reverse comp.
In addition to the reverse comp deals that I previously mentioned we have about 25% of our retrans footprint coming up for renewal over the next 12 months.
And as you know each deal we do resets the bar for the next.
So we are as confident as ever in reaching our stated goal of $2 billion in retrans and reverse comp in 2020.
In addition many of our distribution partners would like to offer more of our programming to their customers on-demand and outside the home.
So with so many successful franchises at CBS Showtime we have lots of opportunities to further monetize our vast programming assets.
Also in 2015 our hit show Elementary will become available in first cycle domestic syndication because of the multi-platform deals we already have in place.
We are on track once again to have another record year of EPS in 2014.
And as we move into 2015 we will certainly be expecting to do it again.
So in summary we are posting healthy gains year-after-year while setting up CBS for an even brighter future.
As we continue to diversify our revenue base our business model is only growing stronger.
To that end the best thing we can do is invest in and produce premium content.
This is already paying off for us in a big way with the launch of new owned hits at CBS The CW and Showtime.
Given our track record we are confident we will continue to reap the benefits for many years to come as we monetize our programming across traditional and emerging platforms.
And all along you can be certain we will continue to focus on driving shareholder value.
So we are very pleased with where we are and where we're going.
And with that Tom we can open the line for questions.
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> Les can you talk about the decision to pay for the NFL this year and how it's impacted your schedule and your results versus your expectations? And I think the NFL has the potential to extend the contract with yourself next year.
How are you feeling about that? Are you expecting and hoping to have that extended? And I just had a quick question for Joe on currency.
You mentioned the $0.04.
Any sense for where -- can you help us see where that's coming from I'm guessing it's licensing? And what the Q4 impact might be? Yes regarding NFL we're extremely pleased.
Unfortunately there were 4 blowout games among those that were aired but the ratings were still very strong.
And obviously it helps our entire schedule.
We're able to as I mentioned move Big Bang to Monday with -- and our Monday numbers were up a lot because of that and that certainly helped it.
We're very pleased obviously with the 1-year deal.
And the NFL does have an option.
We hope they pick it up.
The good news and we said this last quarter because of Thursday Night Football we're going to have more original programming throughout the year.
And as time goes on that becomes more and more important especially as we own that program.
So you're going to see a lot less repeat programming and we expect our continued success.
So all in all Thursday Night Football has been a big plus to us and we hope to continue.
And Ben on your second question regarding foreign currency what that represents really is the translation adjustments as of 9/30.
So the rate as of September 30 is basically converting our receivables mainly in Europe -- in euros and pounds to U.S.
dollars so we don't know where the rate will be as of December 31.
Again so we just wanted to point it out.
We did not adjust it out of our result but we just wanted to highlight it for you guys.
Our next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> I have a bunch of quick -- I hope quick ones.
On CBS All Access how big is that addressable market? I mean did you think this is just going to be for like avid viewers or broadband only? How do you guys think about that? As we said we think it is additive and it shouldn't take away from -- and there's a -- there's many millions of people out there on college campuses the cord-nevers the cord-cutters who want the ability to have and there are 10 million broadband-only consumers out there and we expect to be able to get those people and reach those people and we're very excited about our foray into it.
As we said this is not to hurt our partnerships with the MVPDs that is not our intention but it should be expansive.
Research Division</strong> And along those lines what you announced today the CBS News service is that an advertising-supported service launching tomorrow? Yes it is.
It launches tomorrow.
Research Division</strong> I have 2 other really quick ones.
But Showtime in light of HBO's announcement at their Analyst Day a month ago do you have any plans to go over the top broadband along the CBS All Access lines? Jessica it's Joe.
Look obviously we see the same opportunity HBO does.
We'll look to work with our partners on doing that but as Les said the 10 million broadband-only homes to not make our programming available is certainly doing a disservice to those consumers.
So we have to find creative and innovative ways to continue to have our content where the consumers are.
So we're going to work with our partners to do that.
Research Division</strong> And then one last one.
Just on DISH can you just remind us have you done your retrans deal with them given all the noise around Time Warner? No.
We're -- our deal is up at the end of November and we are in discussions with them as we speak.
And I know Charlie had some disparaging things to say about CNN.
I don't think he could say the same about CBS.
Next question is from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay 2 questions.
The first one I guess going back to the ad market on scatter.
Could you guys talk about if you kind of carve out the impact of the NFL which I know is really difficult what does the sequential delta been like in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? Did you see real softness in the third quarter? And did you see an improvement in that market like some others have even on the broadcast side? And the second question is can you kind of update us on the international licensing market? You sold Madam Secretary into Sky.
You referenced the CSI: Cyber deal.
What kind of numbers do those shows do? Are they like domestic first run SVOD type numbers? And where overall is your sort of run rate on international licensing right now? Joe you want to do the first one and I'll do the second? Yes sure.
Here's what I'd say David on the ad market.
Look Q3 ad trends are improving from Q2 like we said and Q4 is accelerating.
So I think we said even on our last call we see it picking up.
It's hard to just say excluding the NFL when it's 3 hours of prime time on Thursdays for us.
So what do I assume if we pull that out.
So again we're looking at it really holistically and just saying we have the ratings and the content that consumers want they're watching it live and they're watching it delayed.
So when we cume all of that we are well-positioned to take these dollars.
So as Les said pricing is up and demand is building.
So we're very confident that we're going to continue to see that and we like the hand we have.
And David regarding international marketplace everybody knows that it's booming and American dramas specifically are selling -- they're the best sold product there.
We did $1.3 billion in revenues last year.
We expect to increase on that this year.
Once again if you go selling a CBS drama just about every single one of them is north of $2 million per episode.
And that number at the CW comes down a little bit but because of what's happening with SVOD as well as new cable channels the marketplace is very vibrant obviously the U.K.
Germany Canada et cetera.
So having more content is a real plus for us.
We have many output deals and many deals where they're in the open market.
So we're very happy having these own shows being in profit before they even hit the air and then when they become successes on any of our networks that only increases its profitability.
Next question is from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.
Research Division</strong> You guys have great perspective in terms of what's going on in the industry with one of the strongest content stories but yet still healthy exposure to advertising.
I guess can you provide us with some perspective on how quickly you think the ecosystem is changing in terms of consumption of media and where advertising dollars are going? And what that means in terms of your priorities in terms of investments? I mean does for example investing potentially in traditional cable become less attractive now? Yes Alexia it's Joe.
Look here's what we said.
Our buzzwords around here are broadband and mobile and I think everyday we see more and more consumption in those 2 kind of platforms and so how we're addressing that is making sure the best content in the world which we own is there.
And so we're mindful of the existing infrastructure but this is additive and we want to evolve with that.
So our thinking is the content is borderless.
It goes domestically and internationally and it goes to where the consumers want to consume it.
So we need to figure that out.
The good news for us is we have those rights.
Because we own most of our content we're going to figure that out and evolve with the consumers.
This is being driven by the consumer and so again we'll obviously do this with partners and help distribute that content but it puts us in a very good position vis-à-vis the future business model of what it looks like.
So advertising is a key component of our mix.
It will continue to be a key component and we're going to get paid for this viewership and that's key.
It's being measured countered and we expect to be paid for it.
So I think our expectations are very fair.
We're the best at what we do and we expect to be paid that way.
Research Division</strong> And just one quick follow-up if I may on reverse compensation.
It seems like you're getting right into the thick of things in terms of your affiliate renewals coming ahead.
I guess you mentioned your success in getting fair market value in some of these recent renewals.
Given the growing value of the NFL and your content has your view of what fair market value kind of inched up a bit recently? Of course it has.
Obviously we've said this and we feel this way.
We're the #1 network.
We have football on Sunday and on Thursday.
We have the best content throughout.
And as we said in our remarks every new deal exceeds the one before both in terms of reverse compensation as well as retrans.
And the marketplace is treating us that way.
It's -- we've always said if you have the most eyeballs you should get the most dollars.
That has not happened yet.
There's still a number of cable channels that get paid more than we do but we're trying to change it and with every new deal we are changing it.
Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Partners.
LLC Research Division</strong> A couple more questions on the content side.
First you had -- you said the higher TV licensing and subscription fees this quarter in the entertainment segment which was a positive given that I think you had a somewhat tough comparison.
Can you talk a little bit about the entire back half of the year? I guess the concern would be that we don't always see the timing of when things come through.
So was there anything that was a fourth quarter phenomenon last year that was maybe kind of pulled into the third quarter? Or are you still well-positioned for the fourth quarter as well? And then the second question a little bigger picture.
The new -- the successful new shows on CBS this fall.
I don't mean to get ahead of ourselves.
I know you're already licensing them internationally.
How long do you want to see the high level of performance for those shows? Or do your partners want to see it before you start having the discussions about some more ways to monetize them domestically? Joe why don't you do the first? I'll do the second.
Mike I'll start with the first one on the content.
Look content licensing is definitely lumpy.
There's no question about it.
So this quarter we sold Hawaii Five-0 and Blue Bloods.
So it definitely had that.
Again I think that the point is we keep reloading.
We have Elementary going.
So we have nothing hitting first cycles domestic syndication next quarter.
We did sell Dexter last year.
So there'll always be different comps in and out.
But just keep in mind Mike that we have a vast library.
So we can sell other content.
And so I think I know that's hard for you guys to model and project out so I appreciate the difficulty there but I think again if you step back and just think about the library and the content we have it's just timing.
You might just be off 1 quarter or 2 but the fact of the matter is we're going to monetize it at higher and higher rates.
So we want to make sure we do a good deal.
So we don't really look at whether it's going to be in the fourth quarter of 2014 or the first quarter of 2015.
We're trying to maximize the value of the franchise.
And when the marketplace gives us that opportunity we'll do it.
And Mike regarding the new shows of course we're having discussions.
As you recall I think we sold Hawaii Five-0 like 3 days after it premiered.
And having 2 already established franchises having sequels to them with NCIS and CSI we're already having conversations out in the marketplace domestically about what is possible and how you structure these deals.
Fox did a very interesting deal with Gotham right after it went on the air and they sold it to Netflix among other places and did a very clever deal.
Obviously we're out there.
We're talking to them about all our shows right away.
So deals can be happening very shortly.
It's a different world than you just have to wait a couple of years to see results and I think people anticipate where we are now in a few weeks.
Next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
Research Division</strong> You guys have talked about the chance for bringing Showtime over the top like HBO's announcement.
So you also announced in the quarter the sale of Dexter and Californication.
So can you just talk about how you decide to license some of those Showtime shows as opposed to like Californication as opposed to keeping them in-house at Showtime so as not to potentially dilute the future value of potential Showtime over the top offering? And I have a follow-up.
Yes Anthony it's Joe.
Look we've been very conservative with monetizing the Showtime content.
I think HBO now sells their shows after 3 years.
That's on the air.
We wait till the show is effectively off the air to sell it.
So that's really been the rule of thumb that if no current content is available on any other service in Showtime.
So that's where we've drawn the line to date.
Obviously we're getting more and more data but Showtime as a service is a unique offering that has high-quality premium content.
It has sports.
It has movies.
It's very -- it's unique in its offering and we will always maintain that.
I think the one-off shows after they come into the library we're going to just look to optimize it like we do any of our other pieces of our library.
Yes Dexter went off the air a little over a year ago and Californication went off the air this year.
In the HBO offering remember they said sometime in '15 they're going to offer an HBO service.
We could say fairly definitively sometime in '15 there will be some service from Showtime.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just turning to Netflix.
I know you guys announced a deal in the quarter with Netflix in Europe.
Joe can you just help us with the model on Netflix licensing revenues.
Does that deal all get booked entirely in the fourth quarter? Does it spread into 2015? And then also just in the U.S.
in terms of your renewal with Netflix can you please update us on where the negotiation for that the U.S.
renewal with Netflix stands? Yes look -- yes sure.
Look we have ongoing conversations with Netflix all the time.
So we're always talking to them about something.
So you should assume that that happens every single quarter.
The international deal we recognize the revenue once -- when the shows are made available.
So if it's a library deal the shows are recognized again upon execution as long as we deliver the shows.
If it's for new shows internationally where they're getting an earlier window it's when the shows are made available.
So that's the accounting recognition process.
So that's what we follow.
Again it does cause lumpiness but again I think Anthony the takeaway is Netflix continues to do business with us because we have content their subscribers want to see and as long as we have that dynamic we're going to be fine.
Next is John Janedis with Jefferies.
Research Division</strong> Les you talked a little bit about the ad market and I'd say it's been a very long time since anybody's talked about broadcast actually taking share from cable.
And I wanted to ask you what are your advertisers telling you about the allocation of their broader TV budgets in terms of the shift? Maybe to what extent is it sustainable? Or it's just because of the weak ad market? We had a weaker market over the summer obviously and there was a slowness in the marketplace.
But overall broadcasting this year of the 4 major networks 3 of them in viewers are flat or up.
So there isn't a decline yet.
You do see in basic cable more of a decline across the board.
So our advertisers are telling us obviously that once again to reach the broad marketplace that we're still the best game in town and we're seeing scatter grow.
Definitively I can't give -- I can't quantify how much is moving to us.
Obviously there's a lot of conversation about what is going digital.
We don't think the advertising that's going digital affects the $20 million -- the 20 million viewer programs like we are.
We think it affects more of the niche businesses that we're not in.
We'll go next to David Miller with Topeka Capital Markets.
Research Division</strong> Joe I just want to understand the $52 million impairment charge.
Was that just a pure programming impairment? Or I just want make sure you're not impairing any licensing or any other stuff in there.
And then I have a follow-up.
Yes sure David.
The $52 million is related to the Beasley swap for radio.
So basically again the accounting rules when you enter into a transaction based on the FCC licenses and goodwill values and where things are is we record that charge there.
So it has nothing to do with any programming assets at CBS.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Great.
And then just a follow-up on retrans for next year.
As we gear up to just kind of watch how this all plays out with reverse retrans in these negotiations you guys have coming up sort of in late Q1 early Q2 is the right way to think about how you'll negotiate this that you're just going to try to extract the highest number from the non-owned affiliates? Or will you actually help them? Will you help them in their negotiations with the MSOs and then try to take half? I'm just kind of wondering the style of negotiation you're planning to take.
Yes David look our style is we don't plan on negotiating deals for other third-parties.
We're going to negotiate deals for ourselves and we know what fair market value is for our content.
Again we have third-party deals that demonstrate just that.
So we're going in negotiating new deals for call it license fees for content we're providing very valuable content I might add to these stations that allows them to go out and get retrans as well as advertising because remember they're probably the #1 station in their local markets and I suspect they're getting a whole lot of advertising dollars and last I checked when I see TV stations' OIBDA margins they're pretty healthy.
So we're going in with a number in mind and we are determined as Les said to achieve it.
Next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham.
LLC Research Division</strong> So my question comes -- I was speaking at the NAV yesterday and a lot of those guys are saying that when you bring them the competition for All Access they're going to cash for $1 or $2 from you.
And so I'm wondering I know you started with your ONOs at 30% or 40% coverage but as you think about trying to make that a national signal which is what your customer is used to when he pays $6.
How much are you going to actually end up with in the sort of 60% of country you don't own? And following on that building on that also I'm very interested Joe in your thinking about kind of people follow your lead because you guys are the smart guy in the business and if somebody like a Food Network which has always been $0.50 in the bundle spins off follows your lead goes over the top then someone cuts the cord you CBS lose sort of $1.50.
So it feels like sort of a math is your upside is $4 since you've got to pay your affiliate $2 and you're going to lose $1.50 if Food Network follows your lead and somebody cuts the cord with you in it because they're just going to take Food Network instead.
So walk me through how you think about the math there? Whoa Laura that was a lot with a bad connection but I'll take a shot at it.
Look for All Access I think we definitely see the affiliates joining in.
I think we've had lots of conversations with them already.
I think they're excited about it.
They will participate in the offering.
It is a national service.
It's the live piece that we're talking to the affiliates about.
We think again it's a compelling offering.
As Les said in this one service already it has more shows than any other subscription service that's out there.
So yes obviously it is priced at a significant premium to where we are in the retrans reverse comp methodology just for that for again protection.
We don't see it cannibalizing.
We see it as additive but again it's priced as such that it is a premium product because the offering is deep.
And Laura just to clarify it is now a national offering without the live feed.
Now we're getting -- as Joe mentioned we're cutting in the affiliates and they're trying to -- we're making these deals with them to include the live feed but the rest is available nationally right now.
Next question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI.
Research Division</strong> Just wanted to get your opinion from a strategic perspective.
Obviously Starz allegedly is trying to shop itself.
I mean you talked about over-the-top aspirations off Showtime in the future.
Is that strategic? Is there huge cost savings you can see even considered an asset like that? And a follow-up.
I just want to get some color on political.
I think we had you guys doing about $180 million in the last midterm.
Is that sort of the numbers that you got this year too? Look Starz there are 3 premium cable networks HBO Showtime and Starz.
Showtime is doing extremely well and we've done the basis of that on our original programming.
The Starz programming is based more on movies.
It's a very interesting asset but we feel content with what we have right now.
And on political Vijay look I'm not sure where we ended yesterday.
I would say political definitely there was a frenzy towards the end and there was a lot of spending going on so we haven't quite tallied it.
Whether or not we set a new record to be determined but I would say it certainly accelerated towards the end of the election.
Yes we actually called the White House and asked them to extend the date for another week so we could take in more revenue but they wouldn't do that.
Next question comes from Jim Goss with Barrington Research.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Time Warner this morning was arguing for a broadcast model similar to that HBO and Showtime are implying with a lot of the program library available for SVOD.
And I think you do that to some extent but I'm wondering how extensive it is right now? Who calls the shots in that area? And what is the monetization opportunity? Is it loyalty and then payback in retrans? Or is there some other monetization opportunity upfront? Jim I'm not sure what -- I didn't hear what Time Warner said about a broadcast model.
We're very careful about making sure that we don't cannibalize what's on the air and make sure our viewers got an opportunity to see our programming in as many ways possible.
We have a very deep library but I don't quite understand the question.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> Well it seemed like they thought if to the extent you can catch up with all of the series which we can I think at least in some of your shows is that something that's desirable to you? And how that would -- how you would get paid for that if you were to do that more? Jim if what you're saying is there's delayed viewing and consumers' habits are changing for binge or catch up that's absolutely occurring.
And I think that's why Les has said the live rating means a lot less today than it is even just a year ago.
So we are making sure that A it's being measured the ad loads are the same and we can monetize it.
So I just think that again the consumption is still ahead of monetization so that's a good thing but it creates an opportunity for us.
So once again that's why we have All Access and these other kind of platforms to be able to reach those consumers because they have changed their habits technology has changed and allowed them to view the content on their terms and we're going to embrace that.
Inc.
Research Division</strong> And as sort of as a corollary as your own programming library becomes more and more robust as you've described do you either desire or even need another cable channel? Or could you repurpose one of the other ones you have to take more full advantage of that library? I don't think right now we need a cable channel.
We're able to monetize our content in a tremendous way without having to acquire a cable channel.
And that question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.
LLC Research Division</strong> I have 2.
The first you mentioned that CBS All Access will be nationwide.
How long it's going to take you to ramp that up? Marci it is nationwide.
Let's be clear it's nationwide for all video-on-demand library all of that content and in certain ONO markets in addition to that you get a live linear feed of what you're watching on the air.
So just the live linear it's in 1/3 of the country but the rest of it video-on-demand you can watch the next day of the shows for the subscription fee or our vast library you can get for that $5.99 a month today not tomorrow today.
So that is available.
LLC Research Division</strong> I'm assuming you're going to add the live feed.
And the 1/3 will expand as we sign up more and more affiliates to join us.
So hopefully by next year we have most of the country with the live feed but as Joe said if you want to watch any episode of NCIS or The Good Wife or Madam Secretary you can get that today in any part of the country.
Clearly you're not a subscriber yet Marci but we'll give you a free week to turn you on to the service so you can test it.
Would you like us give credit card right now? We'll take it.
LLC Research Division</strong> Yes I'd love to.
I can't wait.
And then just a bigger-picture question.
There seems to be less of an appetite for off-network syndication.
All the networks cable networks that were buying this programming are focused on originals and there seems to be a fear in the marketplace that international syndication and SVOD is not going to offset declines in traditional syndication.
Can you speak to that? Well judging from the numbers that we're seeing that we get between SVOD and all the various deals that we are getting from a variety of sources we're not worried.
The numbers we're selling our new product for are higher than what the old numbers are.
And by the way some of the cable networks that complain they say they're not buying it we're not quite seeing it.
The Big Bang Theory is still the highest-rated show on Turner and that's an off-network.
But with all the variety of places that you can now sell your programming the cable nets just become one small piece of it.
And the numbers now for every single of our shows are more than they were when maybe cable syndication was a bigger part of it.
So there's no fear on our part that we're going to be able to make more money on these shows.
Great.
Thank you Marci and this concludes today's call.
Thank you everyone for joining us.
Have a great evening.
Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference.
We appreciate your participation.
