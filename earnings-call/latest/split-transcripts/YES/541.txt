Good day and welcome to the Bemis Company Hosted Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
Today’s conference is being recorded.
At this time I’d like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters.
Please go ahead ma’am.
Thanks.
Good morning everyone.
Welcome to our second quarter 2015 conference call.
Today is July 23 2015.
After today’s call a replay will be available on our website bemis.com under the Investor Relations section.
Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer Bill Austen; our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Clauer; and our Vice President and Controller Jerry Krempa.
Following Bill and Mike’s comments on our business and outlook we’ll answer any questions you have.
However in order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate we do ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time with a related follow-up and then fall back into the queue for any additional questions.
On today’s call we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance.
Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in our press release and supplemental schedules on our website.
And finally a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties.
Actual results may differ materially from historical expected or projected results due to a variety of factors.
Please refer to Bemis Company’s regular SEC filings including the most recently filed Form 10-K to review these risk factors.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Bill Austen.
Thank you Erin and good morning everyone.
I am very pleased with how our business teams are performing and executing the three tenants of our long-term strategy that we laid out at Investor Day earlier this year.
We are executing with focus alignment and accountability and rigor as reflected in our strong operating results this quarter.
We delivered our highest gross margins in years driven by our strategy to sell the right value-added products and by strong operational performance across our entire business.
We increased operating profit margins in our U.S.
Packaging business to 14.8% a 90 basis point increase over prior second quarter reflecting good progress toward our goal of 15% to 18% in this segment.
We increased adjusted operating profit margins in our Global Packaging segment to 8.1% another 90 basis point increase over the prior second quarter and great improvement toward our goal of double-digit returns in this segment.
We generated $133 million of operating cash flow another quarter of vast improvement over prior year and on our way to meeting full-year expectations.
We continue to demonstrate cost discipline as reflected by our flat SG&amp;A spend and finally we executed our capital expansions and improvements as planned.
We are excelling at most items within our business plan and I’m pleased with this progress.
Next I’ll turn the call over to Mike to walk through the financials and share his comments on the business and then I’ll come back in a bit with my forward-looking thoughts.
Mike? Thanks Bill and good morning.
I will start my discussion today with the consolidated Bemis results then move to comments on each reportable segment and finish with full-year outlook.
This morning we reported earnings of $0.67 per share for the second quarter an increase of 11.7% over the prior-year.
This includes overcoming currency translation headwind of approximately $0.03 in the quarter.
We delivered strong improvement in gross margins at 21.5% versus 20% the prior second quarter.
This improvement was driven by continued efforts in driving our strategy specifically price mix operational efficiencies and diligent cost controls contributed to our improvement partially offset by the impact of currency and volume.
Total Bemis Company SG&amp;A expense was $103.9 million relatively flat with $104.4 million the prior second quarter.
In light of increases from inflation and pension expense we are controlling costs and I expect this to continue out throughout the remainder of the year.
Research and development expense for the quarter was $11.5 million.
We expect to continue around this level as it supports our strategy to accelerate the pace of innovation through the commercialization of new products.
The income tax rate for the second quarter was 33.5% flat as compared to the prior second quarter.
I expect the full-year 2015 income tax rate to be slightly less than 34%.
Cash flow from operations for the first half of 2015 totaled $219 million compared to $70 million last year.
Specifically the second quarter this year delivered a $133 million of operating cash flow as compared to $58 million in the prior second quarter.
I am pleased with our continued progress on cash flow.
We are managing working capital well.
Specifically this year we have lowered inventories and increased payables by expanding terms with our vendors.
We continue to target 2015 cash from ops in the range of $400 million plus.
For the full-year I continue to expect that working capital will not be a use of cash.
I am pleased with the urgency and attention our business teams have placed on cash flow.
We will continue with the keen focus on cash flow to reach and maintain our goal of primary working capital at 14% to 16% of revenue.
Quickly touching on our leverage metric.
Net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter was 2.2 times.
I expect us to continue to generate strong cash flow invest capital wisely and not accumulate cash.
Our priorities continue to be to support our dividend program invest in capital projects fund strategic acquisitions or repurchase shares.
During the second quarter we repurchased 1 million shares for a total of $45.9 million.
At June 30 the remaining Board authorization for share repurchase was 4.9 million shares.
Capital expenditures for the first half of the year were approximately $96 million as compared to $69 million the prior year and in line with our expectations.
Looking next at return on invested capital at June 30 ROIC was 10% a nice increase from the 9.5% one year ago.
We continue to target year-over-year improvement in ROIC and our goal is to reach the top quartile of our peer group over the next three to five years.
We will do so by continuing on our current path of making sound capital investments and improving overall earnings performance.
Next the results of the segments.
First U.S.
Packaging which represents about two-thirds of our total business.
In the second quarter our U.S.
segment saw organic sales decline of 4.3% driven by overall unit volumes which were down 5% and partially offset by favorable price mix.
With regard to unit volumes two items contribute to the decline when comparing to the prior second quarter.
First the impact of our strategic pricing’s discipline second the loss of volume due to some of our customers losing share.
With regard to the impact of our strategic pricing discipline we continue to hold strong on our strategy.
While we target to grow sales of our high technology value-added products we aim to hold volumes flat in the lower technology products we sell.
However in these lower technology product lines we have minimum margin requirements and when those minimums are not met by certain customers we choose not to retain the business.
Comparing this quarter last year these strategic pricing decisions accounted for about two-thirds of the unit volume decline in the U.S.
We will continue to be strong pricers in all end markets.
Also as we have previously discussed we are making select capital investments to improve the margin profile in specific areas of our business where technology and differentiation are not important to customers.
These capital investments will improve productivity and efficiency and will benefit our margin profile.
With regard to the loss volume due to certain customers losing share these specific customer of ours has seen light demand in the marketplace for their products after they took a strong stance on pricing at the retail and called down their package demand throughout the end of the year.
This particular case accounted for approximately 1% of the overall unit decline in U.S.
Packaging.
While unit volumes were a challenge in most end markets of our U.S.
business this quarter the favorable margin impact of price mix strongly prevailed during the quarter.
In our target growth end markets meat and cheese dairy and liquid our overall units were down low-single digits mix within each of these categories was quite favorable to the bottom line.
The new products we are commercializing such as protein snack packs and flat shrink film are substantially accretive to margins consistent with our strategy.
Another item to keep in mind contractual price decreases to pass-through raw material changes were enacted during the quarter did not impact operating profit.
That leaves remaining a sizeable mix benefit that is reflected in the bottom line.
In summary our strategy to improve the mix of products we sell was quite successful during the quarter and we will continue with that mindset over the long-term.
In a few minutes Bill will discuss some actions to address the changing environment in the U.S.
over the next few years.
While organic volume is important to us our main focus is increasing margins in our business.
U.S.
Packaging operating profit return on sales for the second quarter was 14.8% compared to 13.9% the prior year.
Second quarter returns benefited from the favorable sales mix I discussed earlier operational efficiencies and diligent cost controls.
With regard to our cost controls I am pleased with our recent initiatives to uncover every opportunity.
For example we drove reductions in freight utilities and MRO spend during the quarter.
We will continue with an urgent mindset in all areas of our business.
Now I’ll move to the results in our Global Packaging Segment which represents about a third of our business.
In the second quarter Global Packaging sales increased 9.7%.
Currency decreased sales by 15.9% as currencies in Latin America and Europe have devalued against the dollar.
Excluding currency Global Packaging delivered organic growth of 6.1% driven by unit volume growth of 5% in addition to favorable price mix.
Some regional details on volumes.
Units in our small yet growing business in Asia-Pacific were quite strong providing double-digit increases over the prior year.
The growth was in a variety of areas including meat which is one of our targeted growth end markets in Asia.
Units in our Europe business were up low-single digits again in line with our strategy to increase sales of meat and cheese packaging.
Overall units decreased low-single digits in our Latin America business as a result of the continued tough economic conditions in the region.
Despite overall unit volume growth in meat and cheese and dairy and liquid from a variety of new products in line with our strategy to increase the mix of sophisticated valued-added packaging.
Units in our healthcare business decreased low single digits this quarter which we see simply as a function of timing.
Our healthcare business is strong.
We have strong order backlog as we head into the second half of the year.
Turning to the topic of returns in our Global Packaging segment another very profitable quarter.
Adjusted Global Packaging operating profit return on sales for the second quarter of 8.1% compares with 7.2% for the prior second quarter.
Higher returns in Global Packaging were a result of strong operational performance throughout all our regions and improved price mix from sales of meat cheese dairy and liquid packaging.
Currency negatively impacted operating profits by $4.9 million in this quarter or about $0.03 related primarily to the translation of profits in Brazil to the U.S.
dollars compared to prior year.
Turning to full-year outlook.
As we share with you at the beginning of the year our original guidance assume that foreign currency would remain at January levels throughout the entire year.
Our primary translation risk is that Brazil and the reals has moved significantly since the beginning of the year.
You’ll recall last quarter that we were targeting to offset currency during the remainder of 2015 with cost controls.
While we have implemented actions to control costs during the remainder of 2015 I do not anticipate that we will be able to fully overcome the additional currency headwinds that exist if exchange rates stay where they are today.
We will continue to look for additional ways to benefit our bottom line but this is my current view.
Assuming currency stays where it is the total impact on profits versus our original full-year plan is about 11 million U.S.
dollars or $0.08 of EPS.
Due to these currency headwinds we are narrowing our range for 2015 adjusted EPS to the range of $2.52 to $2.62 as compared to the prior range of $2.52 to $2.67.
Where we are within the range will be depended on unit volumes in our business.
We expect to be at the low-end of the EPS range if U.S.
Packaging unit volumes do not recover to prior-year levels.
We are raising our full-year capital expenditure guidance between $200 million and 215 million as compared to the prior year full guidance of $185 million to $200 million.
This increase reflects the aggressive work of our business teams to improve the timeline of projects in our existing pipeline that will support growth and productivity improvements.
In summary I am satisfied with our progress on operating margins cash from ops and ROIC.
I continue to remain confident in our business in our ability to further improve financial performance and create shareholder value.
We still have a lot of work to do but our strategy is right we have resources in line and we have the drive and talent to execute.
I will now turn the call over to Bill for his additional comments on the business.
Thanks but before I start it my voice may sound a little scratchy as I’m fighting a little bit of a cold.
So as Mike mentioned in line with our strategy many things are moving in the right direction.
Return on sales return on invested capital and cash flow all continue to be positive.
However currency and unit volumes have challenged us during the first half of the year.
While these headwinds are likely to continue in the short-term I am very pleased with our progress and the new product commercializations that are being executed to deliver margin improvement.
Our product vitality remains very strong.
As you may recall last year for the first time we started measuring vitality.
In 2014 15% of our total revenue came from products that were launched in the prior three years.
We recently calculated our vitality index through the first half of 2015 and it reflects a vitality of just above 15%.
As targeted we are holding an even slightly improving sales of new products.
I am pleased with this level and the benefit it is having on profits across our entire business.
Our pipeline of new products continues to be strong and we will continue to provide favorable mix and strong margins.
Our strategy to grow sales of high technology products and maintain volumes in our low technology products is right.
We are commercializing new business according to plan across the company from protein snacks to shrink flat film in the U.S.
to dairy and liquid applications in Latin America serving everything from tomato sauces to ice-cream.
As we move forward overall volume growth is a topic we are addressing in new ways.
We have proactively engaged a firm that will help us better understand changing consumer preferences purchasing channels and retailer demand in the U.S.
In addition we will be adding talent and making changes in our sales and marketing organization in U.S.
Packaging to increase urgency.
Although we are in the early stages of these changes I am confident that these actions will help ensure growth in our business during the years to come.
Our strategy is right.
We have a great customer base industry-leading technology a global footprint and talented people with the drive and ambition to make things happen.
In addition to the organic opportunities in our business I am very pleased with our recent progress on acquisitions.
As announced earlier this week we have signed an agreement to acquire the rigid plastic packaging operations of Emplal in Brazil.
This acquisition supports our strategy and will complement our strengths and capabilities in the region.
Emplal’s rigid packaging operations include two state-of-the-art facilities that recorded annual net sales of approximately $75 million last year.
The product portfolio includes rigid plastic containers for a variety of food and household goods.
The transaction is planned to close by the end of this year and with our strong management team in the region I anticipate a smooth integration of the two businesses such that the transaction will be accretive to earnings per share in 2016.
Turning to the full-year As Mike noted we are narrowing our EPS range to $2.52 to $2.62.
Where we are within the range will continue to depend on the impact of the currencies in Latin America volume growth in our target end markets and successful commercialization of new business.
We will continue to aggressively look for ways to deliver profits.
I remain very confident that we will continue to deliver improve -- performance improvement toward our long-term goals.
As we are keenly focused on margin return on invested capital and cash flow we’re accelerating growth with our capacity expansions to support the growing demand for our high-end packaging used in protein liquid medical device and pharmaceutical applications.
We continue to deliver innovation with new product introductions that are on pace and are providing margin improvement across all regions.
We remain focused on our customers as when they win we win and we are striving to continuously improve all we do.
In summary I am pleased with our performance this quarter and look forward to further improvements as we continue executing our strategy.
With that we’ll turn the call over to questions.
Thank you.
[Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.
Please go ahead your line is open.
Hey guys good morning.
Good morning.
Hey good morning.
The pricing discipline led market share loss you called out does it signal Bill that a greater portion of your business is commoditized than you initially thought or maybe the competitive environment is not as aligned on pricing or something else? Yeah Ghansham it’s an indication in some of the lower and non-differentiated product lines that we serve customers with.
Some competitors are willing to go in with pricing that we’re just not going to chase and I’m very happy with the way our teams are really rallying around and getting backbone around price on these lower-end commoditized types of business and what’s more important in all this is that our capital allocation process that we now have in place is focusing on areas where we can put capital towards expanding margins in these low-end non-differentiated product lines and that’s one of the reasons we’re starting to expand margins at the rate we are so feel pretty good about where we are and I’m really feeling good about how our teams are addressing our strategic pricing analytics.
Okay.
And then just as my second question on Brazil was there any deceleration during the quarter that you noticed during you know on a monthly basis just adjusting for normal seasonality? Most of your peers have called it a very tough environment in the region.
Your business seems to have held up relatively well.
I'm curious as to why.
Thanks.
Ghansham in Brazil one of the things that when you get these big swings in currency and the reals weakens the way that it has it creates the opportunity for export.
So some of our customers that we serve in that area are now starting to feel the benefit of that and they’re starting to export specifically in the area of meat and protein.
We had some nice lift in our protein business in Brazil this past quarter and I attribute that to the fact that our customer base is now exporting out of Brazil.
Thank you.
Our next question will come from Scott Gaffner with Barclays please go ahead your line is open.
Thanks.
Good morning.
Good morning Scott.
Good morning.
Just following up on those questions when you look at the U.S.
business today you know what percentage of sales would you consider to be in the high barrier high-margin versus you know the low value products that we are talking about here? Just trying to get a sense of how much of the businesses may be at risk? Yeah you know our charts that we use in our investor books you know if you look to the left-hand side of that bar chart we’re in the 50% ranges in the high barrier high degree of differentiation and as it goes out to the right that differentiation starts to wane.
So 50% is at least in the high-end side of the portfolio.
Okay.
And you mentioned a couple of things.
You said sounded like some competitors were willing to change on price a little bit more than you were.
Have you changed the margin threshold for those businesses at all and the capital you are spending does that potentially you know let you lower the pricing at which you are able to go after that business? Can you maybe just wrap those two things together? Hey Scott this is Mike.
I think the way to think about it is when we talk about recapitalizing our assets what we’re doing is you know putting in new technology etcetera that actually lowers our costs and then makes those kind of external price points that are market driven much better for us from a margin perspective.
Thank you.
Next we’ll move to Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.
Please go ahead your line is open.
Yeah I wondered if you can give us some sense down in Brazil in particular about how much of the growth that you are seeing is coming from existing businesses and how much is coming from some of those new product rollouts that you had? Hi Mark this is Bill.
Yeah.
Difficult to say.
We put in some nine layer ice technology about a year ago commercialized it now it’s really starting to ramp up in the meat and cheese area specifically against local competitors that are selling just a cast nylon film.
It doesn’t have the same characteristics.
So we’re really starting to get that ramped up and our vitality if you look at our vitality for our global business it’s greater than where we thought it would be at this time.
So we’re getting great acceleration in product vitality coming through on the global side of the business.
So we had put some assets into Brazil and we’re starting to fill those up now and take share from local competitors that don’t have the same technologies.
Okay.
And then Bill if I could if I could just for a follow on you know you said you were really excelling in most of the items that were within the business plan.
What are the items where you would say you’re coming up short at this point? You know it’s really volume Mark as we look at it it’s volume and specifically volume in U.S.
Packaging.
That’s it everywhere else; I mean I am very pleased with how this business is operating.
The execution that the teams are on right now the operating guys out in the plants are running at low waste low scrap high throughputs and the commercial teams are doing a great job as well because they have got a backbone around pricing analytics and pricing strategies.
So we get a little bit of volume we drive a little bit of volume but I’ll tell you I’m not losing sleep over it.
I’m not losing sleep over the fact that where our volume is today in the short-term we’re 10% into our five-year journey right? We’ve completed six months of a 60-month journey that we’re on and I’m not losing sleep about where we are right now.
I’m very comfortable with our vitality rate I’m very comfortable with the fact that we’ve got good commercialized pipeline coming on stream all around the world so I feel pretty good about where we’re at.
Thank you.
Next we’ll move to Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Please go ahead your line is open.
Thanks good morning everyone.
A couple for Mike Mike you said you don't expect working capital to be a drag this year.
How much of a benefit do you expect it to be just given that it was about a $150 million drag last year? As I said in the past you know when we get to our goal of that 15% primary working capital it’s an incremental $140 million pickup that is going to cap in between now and the end of 2016.
End of 2016.
And just on the CapEx guidance can you just talk about precisely what precipitated the increase in the guidance? Yeah I’ll comment on that.
You know we are – our business units are executing much quicker than we had anticipated and it’s really more on the recapitalization projects.
It’s not the growth type projects and it’s just a function of stuff that was originally estimated to be spent in the first half of ’17 is now coming – ’16 ’16 I’m sorry is now pulling into the latter part of ’15.
Thank you.
Next we’ll move to Anthony Pettinari with Citibank.
Please go ahead your line is open.
Good morning.
You talked about taking additional steps to locate organic volume growth and understand changes in consumer preferences and you know you referenced that in talent and retaining an outside firm.
I was wondering if it was possible to give any color on how big those changes might be.
I mean is this just a matter of one or two key hires? The firm that you are retaining is it kind of a short-term consulting engagement or is this something more involved? Just wondering to the extent that you can can you give us any kind of color on those efforts? Sure sure Anthony this is Bill.
You know if you just step back for a minute and you look at where we are okay as Bemis Company we are three steps removed from the ultimate buy and that’s the consumer and for years and years we’ve been led if you will by the CPG companies who have been led by their retailer who has been led by consumer preferences.
What we’re trying to do is get more insight and get more knowledge around the consumer okay? Not that we’re going to try to do you know the CPG’s or the retailer’s job but we want to get closer to understanding what is changing in the mind of the consumer base and what new shops are they looking at.
What is online going to look like? What kind of packaging can we bring proactively to either the CPG or the retailer to meet the consumers’ preference and that’s what we’re trying to get at.
It’s something we haven’t done before.
It’s new for us and that’s the direction we’re going there with a boutique consulting firm that is highly recognized in this area and as far as the changes are taking place those changes are taking place in U.S.
Packaging so just we’re bringing in some more talent to help with this whole concept of where the consumer is headed some more analytics some more marketing talent and knowledge and we are in the early stages of it but we want to be proactive because there is a change taking place in the U.S.
and we want to be on the frontend of it.
Okay that is helpful.
And then just in U.S.
Packaging you know the strategic pricing discipline was a drag on vols.
Do you anticipate that drag continuing in the third quarter or the second half of the year? Is it something that is accelerated or maybe was more of a 2Q event or how should we think about that? I don’t think what I’m assuming right now is year-to-date we are down about 3.5% year-over-year in U.S.
Packaging.
My bottom end is we stay at that level but I do also feel optimistic with some of the stuff in the pipeline that we should see that decline narrowing as we go through the rest of the year.
Thank you.
Next we will move to Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
Hi guys.
This is actually Bryan Lynch filling in for Chip.
Just a quick question on CapEx for 2016.
I think I heard you guys saying that you pulled through some of your 2016 CapEx into 2015.
I was wondering if you had any read through on what 2016 CapEx would be.
I still we’ve got some nice recapitalization projects to finish up.
I would consider in that same range that we just led you up to for 2016 200 million-ish 215 some like that.
Next question.
Thank you.
Next we will move to Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
Hi good morning guys.
The share loss clouded some of the numbers but can you help quantify the contribution and the progress of the commercialization of some of your new products.
Is it generally coming in pretty much in line with what you expected a little slower? Just color on that front would be helpful.
Hi Phil.
We are right on track with where we wanted new product commercialization’s to be.
And that’s not just in the U.S.
but it is also in the rest of the world that’s why we got a higher vitality number in the global piece than we would have in the U.S.
but we are still ahead of the 15% that we read at the end of 2014.
So we feel really good we got some new products that have been commercialized and they are ramping up.
We’ve got a self venting retort pouch that is commercial and is on the shelf in grocers right now for pasta sauces and other kinds of sauces and gravies.
And the cool thing about that is that that customer developed that project in our new innovation center and used our equipment and our prototyping equipment to bring that product to market very quickly.
So that’s a real win for us.
We’ve got all these stick packs that are out there.
We got a product coming out now that is a little semi-rigid with a flexible on it and it is a one-handed opening type of a pouch package I should say for these kinds of stick packs where you take two hands and you got to find the tear notch and tear them open.
So a lot of good things going on.
We won a DuPont award for new commercialization of a cheese package.
Now that company is taking that same package and extending it across their product line.
Some customers going back to cold seal away from heat seal films which is a nice thing for us as we were at one time when cold seal was big a leader in cold seal and we will be a leader in that again.
So feel really good about where we are with the pipeline and the stage-gate process of bringing those projects to market quickly.
That is helpful.
How much did resin contribute to the quarter if any and are you done passing pricing through via your price escalators? I am just trying to gauge if the current price mix is a good placeholder for the back half.
With resin we had very minimal benefit from resin in the quarter.
If it would have been of any significance I would have called it out.
And I would say that looking forward the margin profiles are good spot right now but I will caution you as you go into Q4 it’s just our lighter demand quarter sort of it will dip a little there.
Thank you.
Next we will move to Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.
Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
Good morning gentlemen.
I kind of wanted to go back to the first part of Phil's question and I know this is a difficult thing to answer.
But when we see volumes in the U.S.
piece organic or base real volumes down mid-single digits 5% but yet vitality index is working higher.
How should we think about kind of a couple of parts to this – how should we think about if it is possible at all Bill to quantify this or to think about this? Should we be – we think about the business kind of the churn from the perspective of if you have had 5% down base volume but yet you are commercializing lots of new things are we really seeing 10% base business volume down 5% new stuff getting introduced how would we think about that? Yeah.
When business goes away okay when we strategically price something it’s a big piece of volume or that goes away now okay.
And if we lose it because of strategic pricing it’s obviously business that doesn’t have a lot of margin in it okay.
So it’s got a lot of MSI but not a lot of calories alright.
And as we bring on new products they ramp up at a slower pace than a big piece of volume going away.
But the mix that we get from that new ramp up that new product gets introduced has got a lot more calories in it than what just went away.
So our business isn’t modally run the way we are driving things – we are not a big we are driving it because volume has a big impact.
Mix has a greater impact for us and calories in that mix has even a greater impact.
So if you go back to my days at MACtac the old pressure sensitive business that was a volume.
We needed billions of square inches to make that business work okay.
We got out of it because we just couldn’t drive anymore square inches.
We needed more investment to drive more square inches.
Where we are today in the U.S.
is that when a big piece of low calorie low margin business goes away we are refilling that with the ramp up of high value high margin great mix to the business and we get leverage on our return metrics.
It’s how we are running the business.
That makes sense and I get that.
But when we see a net volume number that continues to erode I mean that has kind of led to some of the actions in 2014 with capacity restructuring and some cuts and things of that nature and at some point – I guess maybe to come at one little different way as my follow-up how long would we anticipate to see before you went through a couple year process where it was optimization impact or different things of that nature? You referred to it as where we would continue to see net volumes in a decreasing fashion.
Is this a kind of one piece of business you see as a limited thing and it runs for 12 months kind of at these rates? Is it something that you see persisting? Is the new normal volume environment maybe something that this is an ongoing thing that is a 1% to 2% negative for the next three four five years? How would you kind of think about the pace as we go forward? Right.
Chris I agree with what you said.
We obviously have to grow okay.
We can’t continue to contract alright.
And that’s as Mike talked about the recapitalization capital that is going into the business to recapitalize so that those pieces of business that are at the lower end of the differentiation scale we can expand margins at the current market pricing.
It’s slowing down and we are putting capital into stop it and expand those margins but I agree with you.
We can’t continue to contract we have to grow and we will and we have a good plan to do that.
Thank you.
Next we will move to Mark Henneman with Mairs and Power.
Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
Good morning.
I guess I'm going to try to ask the same question a little bit differently.
But I am curious with this investment that you are doing to maintain the low technology business how long does it take to get that in place? And let's just say it was in place this quarter how much of that business that you lost because of strategic pricing would you have been able to retain? Mark this is Bill.
It’s a difficult question to answer.
The piece of the business we lost was a beverage overwrap bottle of water overwrap.
We retained a piece of it and we lost some okay.
We had a large position we kept some and we lost some because somebody went in with a lower price and we didn't want to chase it down and we felt good with the piece that we retained.
Our recapitalization efforts slow that down and stopped that as we have done with our bread bag business.
We have recapitalized in the bread bag business in such a way that we brought low single-digit business up to low teens margins by recapitalization of some printing assets.
That we’re going to see across the rest of the business as these recapitalization projects get completed.
And then these recapitalization projects they have the same ROIC bogey do you expect them to have the same or to meet that bogey? Yes they sure do Mark.
15% five year average return on invested capital and the recapitalization projects actually have better than the 15% because there is volume to put across those projects right away.
The ones that we’ve installed thus far and we’ve done audits on we are achieving our return metrics faster than the actual request would have outlined.
Thank you.
And next we will move to Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
Just a couple of follow-ons.
One can you give us some sense of kind of pharma and medical packaging as a percent of your sales here in the second quarter and where you would like to see that over the next three or four years? In the second quarter Mark I don’t know if have it.
Even just average for this year that would be a good starting point and then sort of where you want to see that over time? Yeah currently it’s in the 10% range of total revenue.
And we would see that growing with the investments we put in.
And if you go back to the Investor Day we have the business plan around medical healthcare pharma is 10% CAGR over the next five years and there is a plan in place to achieve that.
Okay and then just as a follow-on Mike can you give us some sense of what your M&amp;A pipeline looks like right now? I’m not.
What I’ll say is as we’ve talked before we’re not chasing things that are processes and we are kind of focused on developing relationships with businesses that could come up for sale.
And I would tell you right at the moment it would be a little bit more focused at global than at U.S.
Packaging for reasons of everything in the U.S.
right now tends to be in a process and we’re not going to chase something and pay 10 times EBITDA hope that helped.
Thank you.
Next we will move to George Staphos Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
Thanks.
Hello everyone.
Good morning.
Jumping on the call late so I apologize if you have answered any of these questions in advance.
From a market standpoint how would you grade or gauge your success in re-educating your customers for your need to improve returns to get fair pricing across your SKUs and to what degree are you seeing similar strategies being implemented in your markets from peer companies? Yeah.
George this is Bill.
Good morning Bill.
I would give ourselves a pretty good grade on how our commercial teams are educating our customers.
I give them a fairly good grade.
Can you discuss how you evaluate that the grade that you are giving them and why? I think it goes to the strategic pricing in this initiative and the analytics that we are putting in place.
Our teams are out there talking showing showing the customers analytically the value that we are bringing to them across their portfolio okay.
We bring you field service we bring innovation before we talked about it.
Now we actually have a method to analytically show the customer what that value adds to and that’s all part of the strategic pricing program that we put in place and the analytics that we put in place and I give our team good credit for doing that and it’s helping us expand margins it’s helping us retain customers and it’s also bringing the customers into our new innovation center here in Neenah.
And they are innovating with this self-venting retort pouch I talked about.
The customer came and spent several weeks in our innovation center using our retort chambers using our quick prototyping equipment using our machinery to develop that pouch quickly so now it’s commercial.
I think we’re doing a pretty good job there.
Okay I guess my follow on then would be and I appreciate the thoughts – to the extent that maybe you have already commented on the volume drop in U.S.
Packaging how should we reconcile the volume drop there with the analytics that you are bringing to your customers to demonstrate what value you are bringing to them and your movement up or current absolute level of innovation and value that you bring within your packaging? In other words if I am bringing a lot of value and I'm being very innovative then I should be able to price accordingly and not see as much volume drop off.
So help us reconcile that and again apologies if you have already answered that on the call.
Right.
we see that coming through in mix okay.
If you look at the mix within each segment the mix is getting better within meat it is getting better within cheese we are driving the mix up within segments to be more profitable.
And I think that’s solely attributable to working with the customers more closely bringing them value-add on the frontend.
Protein snacking we are driving that segment right now and every protein customer is coming to us looking for their version of the P3 or the REV package from Hormel.
We've got them now for Sargento.
We've got them now for companies that I've never even heard of before they are all coming out with a protein snack and we are the guys that are developing that for them.
So I think that that’s a reference point for us that we are doing the right things with innovation and we are getting paid for it.
And I truly believe we are getting paid for our innovation.
If you look at the share loss not the share loss but the volume loss in U.S.
Packaging a piece of it was share loss by our customer a very large customer.
They lost share in the market they raised price on a drink pouch lost volume and they called down our volumes for the rest of the year.
So that’s just volume loss because our customer lost share not because we did something wrong.
Thank you.
Next we will move to Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
Hi good morning guys.
Hi good morning.
Just in Brazil can you talk about how that business is performing in the context of the weakness we continue to read about in Brazil and just the outlook for the business for the balance of the year? Yeah.
Alex this is Bill.
In local currency our Brazilian team and our whole Latin American team is doing quite well.
It’s the translation where we see the loss.
Consumption is down however we are staying ahead of the inflation curve.
So in local currency we are doing a great job and continuing to make profit in that part of the world.
And we saw nice improvements in our protein category and our protein segment out of Brazil because of export.
So we feel good with our position in Brazil and the fact now that some of these larger companies down they’re going to start to export their product out of Brazil because of the level of the Real.
So we feel good about it.
That is helpful.
And then just with this drop in resin prices it sounds like it may be at this level for some time are you seeing that accelerate the potential conversion from non-plastic substrates into plastics given where res currently is? Alex I have no data to support a faster conversion at all.
I don’t see anything there.
I don’t have the data.
Thank you.
Next we will move to Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.
Thanks for taking my follow-up questions I appreciate it.
Just one more on resin.
Bill what is your expectation for polyethylene prices later this year? My view of it is going to be stable with where it is today.
I don't see change – I don’t have anything to tell me there is going to be any change from where it is today.
Okay and just one on back to U.S.
volume – sorry to beat a dead horse here but obviously you had your Investor Day a few months ago.
You gave the five-year U.S.
volume growth target of 2%.
We are sitting here midyear 2015 it is down 3.5% and you talked about your customer losing share the strategic pricing you've got the market that is weak.
Is it all of those factors that are driving this decline and do you still expect to grow 2% long-term or just based on what you have seen in the last few months does that target no longer apply? We are 10% into our journey.
This is just a momentary we still expect to grow 2% over that long term in U.S.
Packaging.
We are confident we are going to be able to do that with our innovation pipeline with what we are brining at the table we feel good about that we are not backing off that.
Thank you next we will move to George Staphos Bank of America Merrill Lynch please ahead.
Hi Bill again in the category you may have already answered this and I apologize in advance.
Can you update us if you haven't already in terms of what kind of share move you are seeing in standup pouches? Do you have any data to support whether you are seeing an accelerated move or maybe some deceleration there? And then I have a follow one on a different topic? George I don’t have any data that suggest this moving faster than the 2% that we have seen historically.
However the new self-venting retort pouch it’s a nice win for us.
Okay I will go back to the transcript and dig into that.
I guess the last thing I have for you if you were in our seat and trying to evaluate how you are progressing relative to your guidance both for the quarter and the year what factors would you be looking at that would suggest you are either trending toward the high-end or the low-end of your guidance? What are the key risk factors or swing factors that we would have visibility into? What would you have us key on? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.
Thanks George.
Currency and volume in the U.S.
those are the two things.
We don’t control currency obviously and we are doing everything we can do offset it with cost reductions but that is some we don’t control but if you look at you want to grade us and we talked about where we are focused right we are focused on operating profit as a percent of sale ROS and we want to be 15 to 18 over the overall planning horizon of five years in U.S.
Packaging.
We want to be greater than 10 in global packaging.
We are moving the needle in that direction.
We are on our slope we are on the trend we want to be on.
ROIC we want to be in the top quartile.
We’ve moved the needle and we have moved and we continue to move the needle in ROIC and we are going to continue to move we are on our slope there.
And cash we know that we risked on cash last year we are not going to do it again this year.
Mike has got his whole team wrapped around it the organization is wrapped around it we are doing a good job there.
So in those areas I think we get good grace where we have got to put a little bit more urgency a little bit more rigor is around how we are going to get some volumes in US and that’s where the teams are focused we are only six months in to a 60 month journey.
We feel good about where we are.
We’ve got a great innovation pipeline coming.
We are innovating brining products out every quarter around the world so we are going to move the needle there.
We feel good about where we are and what we’ve done and how we have performed.
Thank you and at this time we have no further questions.
I’ll turn the call back over for closing comments or remarks.
Thank you operator.
Thank you all for joining us today.
This concludes our conference call.
Thank you.
This does conclude today’s conference you may disconnect at any time and have a great day.
