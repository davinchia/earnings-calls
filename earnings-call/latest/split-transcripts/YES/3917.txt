Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Q1 2015 Tesoro Corporation Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Carolyn and I will be your operator for today.
At this time all participants are on listen-only mode.
We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference.
As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would like to now turn the call over to Sam Ramraj.
Good morning and welcome to today's conference call to discuss our first quarter 2015 earnings.
Joining me are Greg Goff Chairman and CEO; and Steven Sterin Executive Vice President and CFO.
While we will not be referencing slides during the call we do have a set of slides which was filed with the SEC today.
These slides along with other financial disclosure and reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures should help you in analyzing our results and can be found on our website at tsocorp.com.
Please refer to the forward-looking statement of the earnings slides which says statements made during this call that refer to management's expectations and/or future predictions are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Act as there are many factors which could cause results to differ from our expectations.
Now I'll turn the call over to Steven.
Director &amp; Vice President</strong> Thanks Sam.
Good morning.
Thank you for joining us today.
I'll start by reviewing the highlights of our first quarter results discuss our outlook for the second quarter and then we'll turn the call over to Greg.
Yesterday we reported first quarter 2015 net income from continuing operations of $145 million or $1.15 per diluted share.
This is compared to $79 million or $0.59 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter excluding special items was $489 million compared to $362 million last year.
The refining segment's adjusted EBITDA was $266 million for the quarter compared to $285 million for the first quarter of 2014.
Our total refinery throughput for the quarter was 696 000 barrels a day or 82% utilization.
The Tesoro Index was $16.71 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 with a realized gross refining margin of $11.77 a barrel or 70% of the Tesoro Index.
This compares to a realized gross refining margin of $10.80 per barrel or 122% of the index the last year.
This quarter's gross margin and the lower capture rates year-over-year are attributable to the combination of higher system throughput during January when margins were lower during the quarter the impact of the labor disruption and the impacts of our turnarounds.
Capture rates in the first quarter were also lower as a result of running more VGO in our California refineries due to the work stoppage and unplanned industry outages.
Direct manufacturing costs in the first quarter of 2015 increased $0.68 per barrel over last year to $6.33 a barrel.
The increase was a result of lower throughput and other another impacts caused by the labor disruptions.
This was partially offset by lower energy prices.
The Logistics segment's adjusted EBITDA was $168 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $71 million for the same period last year.
The strong operating income improvement was driven by the High Plains Pipeline expansion and reversal project the first full quarter contribution from our acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas business and contributions from the West Coast Logistics Assets drop-down.
The declared first quarter general partner distributions are expected to be around $14 million or $56 million on a annualized basis.
But when you combine Q1 LP and GP declared distributions this is expected to be $33 million for the quarter which represents an 83% increase from last year.
The distribution growth along with solid execution and integration of the acquisition continued to demonstrate the enhanced value creation from our logistics strategy.
Moving to retail EBITDA was $138 million up from $29 million in the first quarter of last year.
Same-store fuel sales in the first quarter were higher by approximately 2.5%.
Strong demand and favorable market conditions resulted in significantly improved margins.
First quarter retail fuel margins were $0.19 a gallon.
This is an increase of $0.10 from the first quarter of 2014.
Moving now to capital and the balance sheet.
Capital spending for the quarter was $194 million for Tesoro and $66 million for Tesoro Logistics.
We still anticipate our full-year 2013 capital spending to be approximately $600 million for Tesoro and approximately $450 million for Tesoro Logistics.
Turnaround spending in the first quarter was $77 million.
The total first quarter turnarounds catalysts and other deferred expenditures were $83 million.
We expect full-year 2015 turnaround expenditures of $286 million and deferred retail branding costs $65 million.
We returned $73 million to shareholders in the first quarter including the purchase of 300 000 of the company's shares for $19 million.
At the end of the first quarter we still have $981 million remaining under our authorized $1 billion share repurchase program and plan to continue repurchasing shares in 2015.
Our corporate and unallocated costs on a pre-tax basis were $84 million in the first quarter.
This was substantially higher year-over-year by about $46 million and above our guidance due to $28 million of expenses from non-cash variable stock-based compensation.
This is driven by the appreciation in our stock price.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $0.5 billion.
The idling of operations at Martinez resulted in higher crude inventory along with the higher planned inventory ahead of the Anacortes and Salt Lake City refinery turnarounds.
This led to a large use of working capital during the first quarter of 2015.
But we do expect the majority of these working capital impacts to reverse in the second quarter as we come out of our turnarounds at the refineries.
Now turning to our outlook.
Based on the strong margin environment and the progress we are making with our business improvement plans we expect to deliver significant EBITDA growth in 2015.
In the set of slides supporting our first quarter results and outlook we provide the details of our planned throughput manufacturing costs per barrel and other elements that support the outlook.
With that I'll now turn the call over to Greg.
President and Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thanks Steven.
So we managed through a very challenging first quarter due to the labor disruption at three of our West Coast refineries and planned maintenance at three refineries in our system including the extended downtime at the Martinez refinery after the labor disruption.
We are very pleased with the extraordinary effort of our employees who safely operated the Los Angeles and Anacortes refineries for two months during the strike and our Martinez facility operating as a terminal.
Now turning our focus to the second quarter.
The labor disputes were resolved at the beginning of April and the Martinez refinery has been restarted and is running at full utilization.
The planned maintenance at the Anacortes refinery has been completed and it is running at full utilization.
We expect second quarter utilization of between 90% to 95%.
So far the Tesoro Index has averaged about $21 per barrel this quarter.
In California crack spreads have improved related to the unplanned and planned refinery maintenance activities.
In Alaska we have moved over 1.6 million barrels of Bakken crude oil into our system which historically has seen a yield uplift of about $5 to $7 per barrel versus A&amp;S.
As we announced on April 22 we are confident in our ability to deliver our current 2015 plan which is consistent with consensus EBITDA estimates of about $800 million for the second quarter and approximately $2.6 billion for the full year.
Now moving to our logistics business.
We are very pleased with the first quarter results.
We are making substantial progress on our strategy to create a full-service integrated logistics business.
Our newly acquired Rockies natural gas business contributed approximately $75 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter which includes about $8 million in synergies.
Integration is progressing extremely well and we are currently ahead of our target to generate $20 million of annual synergies.
This underscores our capability of integrating large businesses effectively and delivering the synergies.
We are pursuing new natural gas and crude oil opportunities with our customers in both the Rockies and the Bakken regions to improve our earnings and drive additional growth in our business.
We remain committed to expanding our fee-based business backed by strong minimum volume commitments in order to position our business to be successful in any environment.
We also remain focused on future strategic opportunities to grow TLLP's portfolio of logistics assets around our Western U.S.
footprint.
Tesoro expects to offer additional assets to TLLP in the form of a drop-down in the second half of this year.
We expect to continue to examine organic and third-party opportunities to grow TLLP that would fit our strategic footprint.
TLLP remains committed to delivering $625 million to $690 million of EBITDA in 2015.
And as we look to the full-year 2015 for Tesoro we remain committed to delivering the $550 million to $670 million of improvements and accelerating growth through the three areas that we outlined in December of 2014.
First we plan to deliver the West Coast improvements; second to capture margin improvements; third to further grow the logistics business as I just discussed through TLLP; and we will do all of this while maintaining our strong financial discipline.
Turning to strategic update on our projects.
The permitting process for the Vancouver Energy project to construct a 360 000 barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal is continuing to progress with Washington State's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Committee or FSEC.
FSEC has begun the adjudicative phase.
And based on that schedule that has been communicated they expect to release the Draft Environmental Impact Statement during the middle of this year.
FSEC will submit its recommendation to the governor of Washington once it completes the adjudicative phase.
Additionally during the quarter the company approved two complementary projects at the Anacortes refinery that are designed to enhance clean product production including the previously announced $300 million mixed xylenes project.
Now referred to as the Clean Product Upgrade Project this will upgrade and diversify the value of the product slate.
And a $90 million naphtha isomerization project that will allow us to improve our yields while lowering our cost per barrel.
In addition it enables us to comply with the upcoming Tier 3 regulations.
Subject to permitting we expect the startup of the mixed xylene project in 2017 and the isomerization project in 2018.
Also in the second quarter of 2015 the company completed the work on the second phase of the Salt Lake City expansion project.
However we are currently performing some unplanned maintenance on the FCC unit at the refinery.
This expansion project improves yields of gasoline and diesel improves the flexibility of processing crude feedstock and also increases refinery throughput capacity at the refinery by 4 000 barrels per day for a total of 62 000 barrels per day.
The project increases waxy crude oil processing capabilities up to 26 000 barrels per day.
We expect to run about 20 000 barrels per day of waxy crude which is in line with the original project assumptions.
In closing despite a challenging start to the year our first quarter net earnings grew significantly over last year.
Moving forward in 2015 we are clearly focused on executing our business plan and delivering the improvements we have laid out.
And now we will take your questions.
Operator? Thank you.
And stand by for your first question which comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Please go ahead.
Thanks.
Good morning everybody.
Good morning Greg.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning Doug.
Greg two questions if I may.
First of all on the MLP.
When you made the acquisition I guess you're getting on with full integration now as you highlighted but you obviously had have some plans based on the drilling activity outlook at that time.
I'm just wondering how things have changed; if you are seeing any slow-down or if your original expectations are still holding up? And I've got a follow-up on the West Coast margins please.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
The marketplace out in the Uinta according to our original plan are holding pretty firm at this point in time Doug.
So we don't see any material impact yet.
And more importantly like I mentioned on the call we're actually seeing some interesting opportunities to capture additional volumes on the systems with some projects that we have been developing there.
So we're actually pretty encouraged not only in the Uinta Basin but also in the Bakken as a result of the acquisition.
Okay.
So no change in outlook? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> No.
Thanks.
My follow-up is really on capture rates on the West Coast.
Obviously for a number of very obvious reasons you had a challenging first quarter.
But I guess what we're all kind of wrestling with is that when you look at the sector and Tesoro's stock solid performance in particular it's really paralleled the very strong margin recovery in the first quarter; obviously had a lot of one-offs associated with it.
So my question is margins have recovered in the second quarter.
Can you give us some indication as to how your capture rates are trending and whether or not you see any reason to change your long-term margin outlook so that we can capitalize into your stock price? And if not then how long do you think the tightness in the market persists I guess as long as there is a lot of unplanned outages? And I'll leave it there? Thanks.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I think if you look back at what we said about the overall balances on the West Coast market when you look at what's happening to demand and the demand growth that we've experienced actually over the last few years the production capacity of the refining system and stock levels and that the market in our view is very supportive and relative to what the crack spreads are.
There's no question that during the first quarter with what happened to Tesoro as a result of the disruption at the Martinez refinery because of the labor disruption and then with other operating and planned maintenance things across the whole system it was very supportive to the margin environment there.
So when you look out it appears to us to be still very favorable going forward.
We're not going to project what's going to happen to crack spreads or that.
But when you just look at the drivers of our business it appears to be very very favorable going forward.
I think regarding capture the first quarter your question Doug on capture for us on the West Coast in the first quarter was – Steven alluded to it during his comments.
I mean it was significantly impacted because of we built a tremendous amount of inventory across our system trying to hold crude oil that we had made commitments to buy that we needed to run which we've been running down since that time.
The product that we build in anticipation of turnarounds at Anacortes and Salt Lake City but – and that even though we knew we had labor disruptions we went according to our plans to execute those.
So there was just a lot of noise regarding capture in the first quarter that we think will settle down and works its way out of the system as we go through the second quarter.
All right.
I appreciate the answers Greg.
Thank you.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thank you Doug.
Thank you.
The next question we have comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Good morning everybody.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning Brad.
Just sticking with the first quarter I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the business improvement goals and how much if at all first quarter set you back? Obviously you've maintained the same EBITDA targets but I would think that some of that has to be because crack spreads have been much better than what you originally anticipated.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I think if you focus on your question about the business improvement goals I think yes we were slightly impacted by our delivery in the first quarter primarily because we redeployed hundreds of people to run our refineries.
If you could see what we actually did and how we did it as a company to continue to operate the facilities by redeploying people from all over that definitely took people away from it.
We'll talk more about our improvements the progress we're making after 2Q but we're slightly behind our pace.
We would estimate that we're probably delivering at about 80% or so of our expected rate for 2015 and we're very confident that we have the ability to make that up.
So as you're very much aware Brad in our plans that we presented for 2015 relative to the different areas that I just mentioned there we see delivery in all of those areas for this year.
And we'll be able to deliver the targets that we set out.
Okay.
That's great color.
Thanks.
And then just looking specifically at Mandan.
I was wondering if you've seen an impact on diesel demand there as a result of less drilling in the Bakken and if you can talk about maybe what impact you're expecting to see from Dakota prior in coming online.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Our demand for diesel hasn't been impacted up there.
The area has been historically with the growth and the production in the Bakken has been a very very strong demand area for diesel.
As you just mentioned there we haven't seen any impact on that.
And we know that when whatever the project is you're talking about comes online here it puts additional diesel fuel into the market.
But there's been a lot of diesel fuel that's been brought in from other areas by rail and that that will just back that diesel out.
So we don't see an impact a material impact on the market here.
Okay.
Thank you.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thank you.
Thank you.
The next question we have comes from the line of Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.
Please go ahead.
Hey.
Good morning.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hi Phil.
The first question is just a follow-up to Doug's question.
And I guess it's a slightly different angle.
With margins being as high as they are right now maybe you could just talk about what challenges there are in terms of if you look back the past year or two you've been able to capture well in excess of 100% of the margin in California.
So when margins are this high are there challenges in hitting that number when you're running full? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> The only – probably the biggest impact that we see on the capture rate is that when margins are like this and we're running additional vacuum gas oil through the units that would show up as crude and that it would probably back down our capture rates a little bit.
But the overall ability to capture the crack spread is still very very strong.
That's the only real change that we're doing as running more VGO.
Sure.
Okay.
And with respect to California utilization rates you've run kind of low 90%s for the past 12 to 18 months if I strip out what happened in the first quarter.
So given that the margins are so strong how do you think about your ability to run higher than that moving forward if margins do indeed remain strong? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I actually think we've run around in the high 90%s so I'm not sure Phil what you were referring to in around 90% for California.
California's actually been very very much kind of knocking on the door of 100% for the last several quarters.
And then we were definitely because we've said on Martinez in Q1 impact it's because it was down cold for two months.
But maybe I misunderstood your question.
No okay.
That's all right.
I'll take that one offline.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Okay.
That'd be fine.
Yeah.
And then just my last question is just on return of cash.
Is there a certain percent of earnings or free cash flow you're thinking about in terms of what you'd like to return to shareholders each year? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think we've been pretty clear.
Our approach to returning cash to shareholders one it's based upon we said we believe that we want to keep about $600 million to $800 million of cash on the balance sheet.
We want to fund our high-return capital programs and then return cash both through dividends and share repurchases to shareholders.
And we made the call in the first quarter when we saw the disruptions because of the labor to back off on our share repurchases because we knew we had a lot of turnaround activity in that.
But we fully expect as I think Steven just said to get back on track here now that we're done with the first quarter share purchases.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you for that question.
The next question comes from the line of Jeff Dietert from Simmons.
Please go ahead.
Good morning.
It's Jeff Dietert with Simmons.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hi Jeff.
Hi.
Impressive retail performance during the quarter with the 2.5% same sales increases.
Could you talk about some of your efforts there to grow? And perhaps address were you buying product to meet those delivery requirements given the outages in the first quarter? And if so is any of that lingering into the second quarter? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
So the 2.5% growth is on a same-store basis as you said Jeff.
So that has not a lot of impact on our growth.
But our growth in the retail is primarily growing the use of the Exxon and the Mobil and the Shell brands in certain geographic areas.
So that's where our real growth is in marketing.
We're seeing so far in the second quarter a good continuation in that growth that we experienced in the first quarter.
I think growth from April was at about 1.6% 1.7% growth in April.
And you're exactly right.
With the disruptions that we had in the first quarter we purchased significant quantities of product to meet our demand and we were able to successfully meet all of the requirements to all our customers during that period of disruption.
And because some of the turnarounds started at the end of the first quarter; for example Salt Lake City and Anacortes went down one at the beginning of March the other in the middle of March and continued on through April.
There is a little bit of follow-through into April for those purchases.
But that's incorporated into your $800 million of EBITDA commentary.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
And secondly on your Clean Product Upgrade the West Coast Xylene project I think initially that was a $400 million capital project.
Now it looks like it's $300 million.
Was that a change in scope or just a lower capital option than initially expected? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> No.
We broke out the project with the isomerization unit and broke it into two different projects and did some changes to the scope of the project.
But the overall plan is basically the same now just two different projects.
Got you.
Thanks for your comments.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks Jeff.
Thank you.
The next question we have comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead.
Good morning.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hi Neil.
So Greg you talked about at the TLLP level the potential for organic opportunities in the Western U.S.
and then also third-party acquisitions.
Wondered if you can flesh that out.
What is in the scope of those growth projects you would look at? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
It's a good question Neil.
The organic growth projects in almost all cases complement our existing assets and they either add to from a pipeline gathering standpoint or they drive better optimization of the asset.
So for example in the Uinta Basin a number of projects that we're looking at drive higher throughput through the systems allow us to get better utilization of the processing plants and that with a number of top-tier customers really.
So it's really complementing our existing asset base.
And same thing in North Dakota.
The opportunities that we're looking at in North Dakota fit into our overall gathering and pipeline and storage system up in the Bakken.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's very clear.
And then Greg I think you and I have talked about this in the past but the idea of doing a retail spin-off or monetizing some of the retail assets and the wholesale assets.
Curious on your updated thoughts there and whether you think that could potentially create value.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yes.
Neil like I had mentioned to you in the past our first focus is continuing to grow our marketing business to drive higher levels of integration across our system and all of the geographic areas.
And so we're actively looking to do that.
At the same time we are looking at our overall marketing business and we are doing that and plan to have it completed in the second half of this year on how we would want to position that marketing business going forward.
We haven't reached any conclusions on that at all yet.
Okay.
And the last question – this might be a tough to answer – but as think about Port of Vancouver are there any milestones we should be looking for in the next couple months? And then we've seen a bunch of crude by rail incidents here over the last couple of weeks and couple of months.
And any thoughts on the political ramifications there?.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I mean I think on the Port of Vancouver there is no question that the process that we are under with this FSEC council that I mentioned is moving incredibly slow.
And it's slower than we anticipated as a company.
Between ourselves and Savage we do everything possible to keep it moving forward.
But at the end of the day we're somewhat at the mercy of how that council progresses and that.
So if you look they do publish things.
They have stated for example the adjudicative process has begun.
The administrative law judge who oversees that process has been very clear about the timing in that.
And you can see that actually.
It is public information.
It's a fairly aggressive schedule that has been set on that.
The Environmental Impact Study needs to get out into the public domain to allow that to progress.
That is a really key thing; that we're kind of in the window where that should come out here early this summer.
And that's probably the most important milestone is to get that EIS out into the public domain to allow the adjudicative process to go forward.
But it's painfully slow.
Fair enough.
Thank you Greg.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks Neil.
Thank you.
The next question we have comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Cowen &amp; Company.
Please go ahead.
Good morning.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hi Sam.
You touched on this a second ago sort of about the way the QEP assets and the rest of your TLLP assets integrate with the refining system.
But I wanted to ask drought conditions out in the west have been very bad this year.
There's a view that gas demand in California could see some elevated levels.
What kind of flexibility does the gas transportation or marketing system have as far as placement of those volumes or is it really all sort of circulating within the Mid-Con footprint? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> So I'm not completely sure I understood the question.
But as far as the West Coast on for gas supply to the market are you saying going into the California system and you're saying...
Well your system specifically.
Is TLLP able to market gathered gas in other regions besides sort of your home Mid-Continent base including ...
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Oh you're talking – are you talking natural gas? Yeah.
Natural gas.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I apologize.
I thought you were about talking about gasoline.
We can supply gas through the system to put it on the mainlines to go up.
There're a number of pipelines that supply the West Coast from our area.
We're not involved in those mainline that run up to the West Coast but we easily can get gas into those systems if that's where the economics are to move the gas to the West Coast.
Okay.
That's helpful.
Yeah because there's a view that hydropower's going to be constrained and there could be incremental I guess gas...
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Natural gas demand.
And then secondly it looks like at the Tesoro level net debt is more or less equal to the value of your TLLP limited partner holdings.
Now that the general partner value is starting to accrete sort of very rapidly as you grow volumes and add assets what's sort of the view on that LP stake and levels that you want to maintain? It seems like it is still kind of a source of cash to the parent company level.
But just sort of a philosophical view about your LP versus GP holding and how the LP stake now might function as a source of funds for future projects.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I'll let Steven comment on that.
Director &amp; Vice President</span></strong> So as you look at the near term we're still committed to dropping down assets that makes sense into that business that allow us to generate cash for Tesoro to your point and help us continue to return cash to shareholders and invest in high-growth projects.
But also allows our Logistics business to leverage those assets to grow both organically make improvements to the assets.
And so as we look at that that's a key part of the growth plan and liquidity plans.
A lot of the value to us comes to the GP units but we do like to own the LP.
We think it's a good investment even at especially today's levels for Tesoro to own LP units and get distributions through that as well.
And so we'll look to balance – the focus is growing the business both organically and through drops.
And then behind that realizing the value on the GP unit ownership but also continuing to play a very active role and have a large ownership of the LP.
We haven't put a specific percentage on there.
I think we'll look at that.
As we look at the drop portfolio we look at the yields and we look at where we can create the most value with the cash whether we do something like we did last year which was make an investment in LP units to fund a very attractive acquisition or to make drops that are more balanced towards equity.
We'll evaluate those based upon where the best returns are to our shareholders.
All right.
Thank you.
Very helpful.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks Sam.
Thank you.
The next question we have comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.
Please go ahead.
Inc.</span></strong> Hey guys.
Good morning.
Greg I had a follow-up...
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning Blake.
Inc.</span></strong> A follow-up on Vancouver.
I guess back at to your Analyst Day I think you had provided an initial startup date hopefully in the second-half of 2015.
Given your comments this morning of being painfully slow I have to assume that that's been delayed.
Do you have a best guess just roughly speaking? I mean do you think that could be potentially pushed back to first half of 2016 or second half 2016? Just any guess on timing? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Like I said Sam we're kind of at the mercy of FSEC and how they go through that process.
And definitely our expectations of how we thought it would work and what's actually happening has been different.
It would be a guess.
If they stay on the course of releasing the draft Environmental Impact Study and if the administrative law judge adheres to the schedule that's been published in that something could happen in the first part of 2016.
But we're absolutely committed to the project.
We believe that it will be successful and we just have to keep focused on being able to work through and do everything we can to convince everyone of how valuable this project is.
Inc.</span></strong> No I understand.
Thanks.
And just following up on that you probably have provided this in the past.
But could you remind me is there a just general rule of thumb we should be thinking about that as far as an A&amp;S to Bakken differential that has kind of a breakeven? I know there's a yield uplift and et cetera.
But is there just any kind of rule of thumb we should be thinking about as far as what kind of differential you need to make that project kind of fly? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think if you look at it without the upgrade because as you recall Blake one of the things we've been very clear about is the quality of Bakken crude oil versus the alternatives that are run on the West Coast provides that upgrade which we've said has been consistently $3 to $5 a barrel.
If you exclude that and then just look at it on a transportation basis I think it's around – is it around $6.50 Brian? Refining Tesoro Corp.</span></strong> Yeah.
That's right.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think that if you look at a differential of about $6.50 between Bakken and A&amp;S like you said that at today's transportation rates allows for you to have a highly attractive project.
I would just make two additional points.
One is that that's where transportation rates have been in the past.
I think there's a possibility that those rates could change favorably which would change that breakeven point that you're talking about.
And so I think that's – I forgot my second point now – I forgot what I was going to say.
I think that's one thing to be aware of.
Oh and then the second thing is how you collect the crude and get it into the system is important.
And as you know that's a pretty commercially sensitive area..
But what's important is and the value for us of our High Plains Pipeline system is that we have the commercial relationships to be able to gather that crude at a different cost than just going out and buying it at Clearbrook that's the second part.
Inc.</span></strong> Got it.
Thank you.
The last one for you.
You mentioned being at about 80% of plan on your improvement initiatives.
I just wanted to confirm.
For the full-year outlook on EBITDA of $2.6 billion does that still contemplate a Tesoro Index – I believe it was a $10 to $12 a barrel range at your Analyst Day? Are you still using that or have you adjusted that for a more favorable West Coast environment? Thanks.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
The $2.6 billion it reflects a higher index.
Probably index of around $16.
Director &amp; Vice President</span></strong> I'd say $16.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> About $16 to get to the $2.6 billion relative to what we said at the Analyst meeting Blake.
Inc.</span></strong> And presumably that's all West Coast driven I'm assuming right? Director &amp; Vice President</span></strong> Principally.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah it primarily is.
The rest of them I think are pretty comparable.
Director &amp; Vice President</span></strong> Yeah.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thanks a lot guys.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thank you.
Thank you.
The next question comes from line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo.
Please go ahead.
Thanks.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hi Roger.
Guess maybe we could talk a little bit about demand.
Question earlier hitting on the natural gas but this time maybe on diesel.
With the drought and the impacts of water rationing potentially impacting the farming industry I was wondering do you see any broader impacts on demand on the diesel side or the distillate side of the barrel here? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> At this stage we haven't seen that Roger.
I mean it doesn't mean it may not materialize as we go through the year.
But we have no experience that that's happened so not yet.
Okay.
Great.
And then on Port of Vancouver years ago when this process started and unfortunately it is now with a plural there were always alternatives if Port of Vancouver didn't go through or an agreement couldn't be reached.
Are there still alternatives out there if something doesn't work? And I mean in the same area.
I mean we could obviously always try to rail to California but that seems to be an even more permit-challenged world.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yes.
I think there are some alternatives.
They are nowhere near the magnitude naturally of what Port of Vancouver can do both from a volumetric standpoint and probably more importantly from a cost standpoint.
It just drives incredible efficiencies.
So the other opportunities that we're also looking at and we've always looked at are much smaller in scale.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thank you.
The next question we have comes from the line of Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead.
Yeah.
Good morning Greg.
Just a quick follow-up.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hi Ed.
Thank you.
The $16 per barrel Tesoro Index I mean I'm just looking at the main numbers on the website.
You got California at $25 Pacific Northwest $20 and Midcontinent $24.66.
Is that $16 the weighted average of three or is that just California – sorry – just to clarify? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> The $16 is for the system for the entire year.
Right.
Okay.
Director &amp; Vice President</span></strong> On average second quarter through the fourth quarter.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Yeah.
And I know you've done this.
Have you got a dollar per barrel sensitivity for every dollar for EBITDA? I could probably do it quickly but...
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I mean we typically run about 300 million barrels a year.
So if it's $1 dollar that kind of gives you an – over the course a year it tells you every dollar's worth about 300 million.
And if it's $5 it's a different number.
Okay.
Secondly moving over to QEPFS.
You say you're encouraged and you're ahead of the target on synergies.
Have you been able to come up with sort of an incremental estimate of the CapEx that you might be able to deploy into those two basins now that you've operated the assets for a while? I'm thinking about two aspects of it.
One is improving the internal logistics of the Bakken which obviously is still an opportunity even if the Bakken volumes overall are flattish.
And then the commercial response for the Uinta Basin which was obviously one of the constraints under the old ownership but which you thought might change if you were opening.
So just some color on those two opportunities.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I think we are working some opportunities to do some of the things that you've talked about.
It's premature to talk about those because they're under discussion.
But everything that we see so far in the Uinta and in the Bakken it's really allows you to take the existing assets and build those out.
I think it goes back to Neil's question a little bit earlier that if you take the kind of the backbone of the systems that we have there and working with the producers to go out and bring in either additional volumes or optimize that we do see that.
So from a capital standpoint Ed it's just a little bit too soon to talk about that.
But I suspect we'll be in a lot better place in the next few months to talk about specific projects.
Yeah.
I mean CapEx obviously helps us to model EBITDA down on the road so that's why I was asking.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just a little bit too early.
Okay.
And then just a final question.
The drop in the second half of this year any color on what that is at this point? President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> No.
I mean we still target the drop that we've said all along around a $50 million EBITDA type drop is still in our plans.
So we have a number of different assets that we're considering.
Great.
Thank you very much.
President and Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thank you Ed.
Thank you for that question.
That's the end of the question-and-answers.
So thank you for participation in today's conference ladies and gentlemen.
That concludes the presentation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a good day and a good weekend.
