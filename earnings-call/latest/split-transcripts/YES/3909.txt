Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Q1 2013 Tesoro Corporation Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Sonia and I will be your operator for today.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would like to turn the call over to Mr.
Louie Rubiola Director of Investor Relations.
Please proceed sir.
Thank you Sonia.
Good morning everyone and welcome to today's conference call to discuss our first quarter 2013 earnings.
Joining me today are Greg Goff President and CEO; Dan Romasko Executive Vice President of Operations; and Scott Spendlove Senior Vice President and CFO.
While we will not be referencing slides during the call we do have a set of slides which was filed with the SEC today.
These slides along with other financial disclosure and reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures should help you in analyzing our results and can be found on our website at tsocorp.com.
Please refer to the forward-looking statement in the earnings slides which says statements made during this call that refer to management's expectations and/or future predictions are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Act as there are many factors which could cause results to differ from our expectations.
With that I'll turn the call over to Greg.
Thanks Louie.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on this call today.
You have our earnings release and Scott will go over some of the details of the results in a moment.
But I'm going to start with an overview of some recent highlights.
Despite significant turnaround activity during the quarter and $47 million of non-cash stock-based compensation accruals we delivered a solid operating performance and strong first quarter earnings excluding special items of $0.73 per diluted share.
In addition to this solid operating performance we have made significant progress on several strategic fronts.
We recently announced a joint venture with Savage to own and operate a 120 000-barrel per day unit train unloading and marine loading terminal at the Port of Vancouver in Washington allowing us to drive additional feedstock cost advantage throughout our West Coast refining system.
In April we ceased refining crude oil at our Hawaii refinery and began to make adjustments to accommodate product imports terminalling and distribution at the facility.
We are nearing the completion of the project to expand the distillate desulfurization unit at our Mandan refinery allowing us to yield more high-valued diesel fuel.
And similarly we expect to execute the first phase of the Salt Lake City Conversion Project this quarter expanding our capability to run cost-advantaged waxy crude oil and driving product yield improvements.
Finally during the first quarter we continue to execute our share buyback program with $100 million in purchases.
So far in the second quarter we purchased an additional $45 million taking total purchases to nearly 50% of the $500 million outstanding program.
Now turning to results for the quarter.
Improved light product crack spreads and continued feedstock cost advantage provided an attractive margin environment in the quarter.
As a result the Tesoro Index in the first quarter averaged over $12 per barrel up more than $2 per barrel from a year ago while the company's realized gross margin was $13.68 per barrel or 110% of the Tesoro Index.
Despite significant turnaround activity especially with our upgrading units refinery throughput rates during the quarter averaged 579 000 barrels per day or 86% utilization up 50 000 barrels per day relative to the first quarter last year.
The year-over-year increase in throughput is attributable to the expanded capacity at our Mandan refinery and a high degree of crude oil distillation unit turnaround activity in our West Coast operations last year.
Beyond reporting strong operational reliability this was the first full quarter recognizing the benefits of 3 large capital refinery projects we put in service last year including the 10 000-barrel per day expansion at our Mandan refinery the unit train unloading facility at our Anacortes refinery and the new vacuum tower at our Wilmington refinery.
The additional earnings from these high return capital projects which broaden our exposure to advantaged crude oil and drive improvements in product yields are in line with our expectations and are reflected in our first quarter results.
Manufacturing costs in the first quarter averaged $4.86 per barrel up slightly quarter-over-quarter impacted by higher energy prices and planned turnaround activity.
Retail fuel sales volumes were up 18% year-over-year reflecting the Albertson's Express and Thrifty retail stations we brought into the system last year.
Same-store fuel sales during the quarter were up about 1% and retail marketing margins were about $0.08 per gallon -- up about $0.08 per gallon relative to the same period last year.
Capital spending for the first quarter was $119 million.
Turnaround spending was $132 million.
We expect consolidated 2013 capital spending of $560 million including regulatory maintenance and income projects.
This is up from our prior guidance driven primarily by the Port of Vancouver project and some additional logistics projects at Tesoro Logistics.
We continue to expect about $310 million in turnaround spending for 2013.
As we shared with you in December of last year this is a peak turnaround spending year for the company and we look forward to lower planned spending and improve product yields for the next few years.
As we look forward we remain optimistic about U.S.
refining market conditions.
Independent of favorable market conditions we are driving significant value from our existing asset base and optimizing our portfolio of assets.
We are very pleased with the benefits to date resulting from the successful execution of our strategic plan.
Before I pass the call to Scott I'd like to take a minute and discuss our latest strategic announcement the equally owned joint venture with Savage to develop and operate a new unit train unloading and marine loading facility at the Port of Vancouver Washington.
This project builds on the recent success at our Anacortes refinery where we were the first refiner to bring Bakken crude oil to the region via unit train.
This project is equally as exciting because the Port of Vancouver is the most direct and cost-effective coastal outlet for Bakken crude oil from North Dakota with a rail tariff lower than to Anacortes.
This facility with initial capacity of 120 000 barrels a day will be designed with near-term expansion capability up to 280 000 barrels per day.
The joint venture agreement grants Tesoro the right to the first 60 000 barrels per day of throughput capacity which we expect will come online in 2014 subject to permitting import approval.
We've ordered additional rail cars as part of this strategy and expect to take delivery beginning mid next year.
In an effort to allow us to optimize around crude oil quality these additional cars will be coiled and insulated.
We expect to utilize our current U.S -- flag marine capabilities as well as supplemental shipping capacity.
The combination of the unit train origination and ultimate delivery via marine provides an unmatched degree of cost-advantaged crude oil sourcing flexibility and makes this a powerful and exciting opportunity for Tesoro.
Finally our ownership in this facility will be an attractive potential asset for Tesoro Logistics once completed.
We look forward to realizing the significant value from our remaining capital projects in addition to the value created from the transformational Carson acquisition.
Regarding Carson.
We've made significant progress on the integration plan have our financing plans in place and are nearing the end of the regulatory review process.
We remain very confident in our ability to close this transaction creating a high-quality worldscale refining complex that provides opportunities to achieve economies of scale reduce costs improve the environment and benefits consumers while improving Tesoro's competitive profile.
Our team is aligned on a clear and focused strategy to deliver additional value to our shareholders.
With that I'll turn the call over to Scott Spendlove our CFO for a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and to provide guidance for the second quarter.
Scott? Thanks Greg.
As we reported last night first quarter net income was $93 million or $0.67 per diluted share.
After special items we reported an adjusted net income of $102 million or $0.73 per diluted share.
Special items that we're excluding from the quarterly results include $9 million after-tax related to transaction costs of the Carson refinery and Chevron Northwest Products System acquisitions.
That compares to net income in the first quarter last year of $56 million or $0.39 per diluted share.
Our corporate and unallocated costs for the quarter were $42 million before $5 million in corporate depreciation $47 million in noncash stock-based compensation accruals and $14 million pre-tax in transaction costs.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $119 million.
Turnaround spending was $132 million.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2 billion a build of over $300 million for the quarter.
The gain reflects EBITDA of $297 million and net proceeds from the January TLLP equity offering of $392 million offset by capital and turnaround spending of $251 million shareholder distribution to share buybacks of $177 million and cash and interest taxes of $41 million.
Working capital and other items provided a source of cash of about $113 million.
We remained undrawn on the corporate and TLLP revolvers with additional revolving credit capacity of over $1 billion and $0.5 billion respectively.
During the quarter we put in place interim financing facilities for our upcoming acquisitions.
For the Carson acquisition we amended our corporate revolver expanding total capacity from $1.85 billion to $3 billion.
And we closed on a 3-year $500 million term loan credit facility.
Both of these facilities become effective just before the close of the Carson transaction and both offer extremely attractive borrowing rates and repayment flexibility.
We also upsized the Tesoro Logistics revolving credit facility from $300 million to $500 million as a ready funding alternative for the sale of the first tranche of Carson Logistics assets to Tesoro Logistics LP.
With cash on hand low leverage the expanded corporate and logistics revolvers and the term loan commitments we are well positioned to fund the closing of the Carson acquisition.
During the quarter we also raised net proceeds of $392 million through a very successful follow-on equity offering through Tesoro Logistics.
We expect to use the proceeds of that equity offering to fund the acquisition of the Chevron Northwest Products System.
Turning to the second quarter.
The second quarter typically sees seasonal increases in demand for gasoline and distillates in PADD V.
Quarter-over-quarter increases of greater than 4% are typical for gasoline and increases of over 8% are typical for diesel.
Reductions in supply from planned and unplanned refinery maintenance on the West Coast have supported crack spreads quarter to date.
In the Mid-Con gasoline and diesel crack spreads remain strong.
And so far in the second quarter the average discount of WTI to Brent remains about $10 per barrel down over $4 per barrel relative to the second quarter last year.
I'll close with guidance for second quarter modeling purposes.
We estimate throughput to be in thousands of barrels per day: 135 000 to 145 000 in the Pacific Northwest; 15 000 to 25 000 barrels a day in the Mid-Pacific; 100 000 to 110 000 barrels per day in the Mid-Con; and 265 000 to 275 000 barrels per day in the California region.
Manufacturing cost guidance for the quarter in dollars per barrel is as follows: $4.85 in the Pacific Northwest; $9 in the Mid-Pacific; $4.30 in the Mid-Con; and $6.05 in the California region.
We expect throughput and product yields in the Pacific Northwest and Mid-Continent to be negatively impacted by planned turnaround activity.
Our guidance for Hawaii reflects refining operations for the month of April only.
Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $93 million.
Additional second quarter guidance items include estimated corporate expense excluding depreciation of $50 million and interest expense before interest income of $31 million.
Our corporate expense guidance includes the impact of additional transaction costs.
And with that I'll turn the call back over to Greg for closing comments.
Greg? Thanks Scott.
We are pleased with our first quarter results.
With the bulk of the West Coast turnaround activity behind us we look forward to executing the remaining turnaround schedule for 2013 in the near term.
We also look forward to delivering the 2 large capital refining projects in the Mid-Continent during the second quarter.
We are encouraged with our continued success in driving improvements in the business and delivering on the plan we laid out for our investors.
And with that we'll now take your questions.
Operator? [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Chi Chow Macquarie capital.
So Greg on the Savage JV facility can you talk about your decision to go with the combined rail and marine system rather than direct rail into the California refineries? Yes Chi.
Two simple explanations.
One the cost to deliver by the way that we plan to is more than competitive with taking crude oil directly into California by rail.
And secondly the time to the market to be able to do that is considerably different.
Time to market quicker with marine? Considerably quicker.
By the way we're doing it through Vancouver versus going directly into California.
Okay great.
Can you remind us how many Jones Act vessels you operate in the capacity? We have adequate capacity Chi to handle the additional volume that we plan to move from Vancouver down there as part of our total operations as we change the way we ship product -- or crude excuse me.
Okay.
And then is the plan on the heated rail cars to target moving raw bitumen rather than dilbit into Vancouver and then ship from there? The way that we've designed our crude supply to the West Coast gives us considerable flexibility not only with the qualities of crude but also where we take that crude oil ultimately.
Now with Anacortes and Vancouver we have that flexibility to meet the needs of our refining system.
Okay.
And then final question I guess related to Carson.
Greg you mentioned in your remarks and you described it actually in your special items.
But can you talk about what sort of integration activities you're undertaking right now at Carson prior to transaction close? I'll ask Dan to speak about that because that's been -- Dan's been leading that effort now for 9 months.
Yes Chi the primary activities now are focused on change in control the days directly in front of it and the days directly following it ensuring that our systems and processes will be effective.
High level synergy work's already been completed as consistent with what we've previously announced.
We get to do a great deal more detailed look on data of change in control when the anticompetitive issues are no longer an issue.
Okay.
So is this really integrating with Wilmington with your existing operations down there? Integration with Wilmington but not just the refining assets.
This is marketing and logistics.
So it's a business much broader than just a grouping of assets.
And all of our back office Chi I mean we need to integrate with all of our accounting systems and everything.
It's a comprehensive integration.
The next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng Barclays.
Research Division</strong> Scott can you give me a number of balance sheet item first the working capital for Tesoro and TLLP? And also what is the TLLP debt and cash position? Working capital for corp is $1.9 billion including cash.
And we don't -- I don't have working capital for TLLP at this point.
Research Division</strong> The $1.9 billion is that excluding TLLP already? No this is on a consolidated basis.
Research Division</strong> That's on consolidated? Okay.
Do you have TLLP what is the debt and cash position? I don't have that with me Paul.
We'll release TLLP results on Monday.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And Greg on the Carson process can you tell us when did FTC wrap up the last interview [ph]? So Paul we are basically at the end of the regulatory review process.
We have provided all the information requested by the FTC and the California Attorney General.
The process as you know is a confidential process.
But everything now is in the hands of the FTC and the California Attorney General.
But like I said before we remain very very confident that we'll close the transaction by the end of this quarter without any material changes to what we proposed in the original transaction.
Research Division</strong> Okay that's great.
And for the -- you talked about the 3 major projects that they are performing in line with your expectation.
Can you give us an idea how much is the contribution in the first quarter from those 3 projects? And I guess that specifically is for the unit train operation? If you look back Paul and look at our prior guidance that we've given around all of the projects and we've tried to share based upon our market assumptions of the EBITDA associated with those projects all of those projects are in line with exactly what we provided with prior guidance.
Research Division</strong> And in the unit train are you now running at 50? Or you're still at 40? The unit train -- our Anacortes refinery was one of our refineries on turnaround which came up at the end of April here.
And so we will ramp up to 50 now 50 000 barrels a day now that we are completing the turnaround.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So that refinery is just finishing the turnaround right now? Just completed within the last couple of weeks there.
Yes.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Other than Anacortes in terms of the turnaround for the second quarter is there any other turnaround we should be aware? We mentioned earlier we have both the Salt Lake City refinery and some turnaround activity at Mandan both planned turnaround and also associated with the projects that are going on at both of those refineries.
Research Division</strong> Greg will you be able to share with us which unit is going to be in turnaround? Well the Salt Lake City refinery is a comprehensive turnaround Paul at the refinery.
Partly because as we've talked about before the project to be able to process more waxy crude oil to improve yields at the refinery and increase capacity that's -- we're in the first phase of that project as we said in the past.
And at Mandan the maintenance work will be associated with the changes that we're making to the desulfurization unit to process more diesel fuel.
Research Division</strong> And Anacortes the turnaround was just at the cracker right? No the Anacortes turnaround was a full plant turnaround this year.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And do you have Scott do you have a rough number what was the opportunity cost in the first quarter due to the downtime? The way we look at it Paul during the first quarter the turnaround activity met our plan during the first quarter.
It will be greater than that what we expect in the second quarter with the turnaround activity.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
A final one.
Any rough estimate how much do you pay for the RIN in the first quarter? Our position on RINs as we stated in the past we run a very integrated system.
We're approaching 80% integration between refining and marketing.
We also have some exports off the West Coast of the United States.
And we carried RINs over from 2012 into 2013.
So our position from a RIN standpoint for 2013 is not a material impact on the company.
The next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson ISI.
Research Division</strong> Greg one of the key messages from the analyst meeting was about the intention to strengthen the West Coast business through some targeted investment and cost productivity plans.
And on this point performance continues to be pretty strong in California both in terms of the capture rate you're receiving on the benchmark margin and also operating cost.
So I wanted to see if you could provide us an update on the key initiatives out in California? And how they're delivering thus far in relation to expectations because it seems like they are performing very well? And whether or not there are any other factors that were worthy of mention as it relates to recent performance in California for the company? Yes it's a good question.
Let me ask Dan to comment on that.
All right.
So California was a focused effort to find initially $1 per barrel of sustainable operating cost improvement.
We reported in December that we achieved close to 70% of that target on an energy price normalized basis.
The real focus areas we're driven towards the reliability of the processing units which allowed us to put in more throughput as well as decrease fixed costs associated with reliability issues.
The early focus was in the maintenance process area and that's -- it's still bearing strong fruit.
The improvement journey continues.
And I may just add one additional comment to what Dan just shared Doug.
And that is the real focus we have -- additional focus I should say right now is to be able to take crude oil to the West Coast and strengthen our cost advantage from the way we process crude oil there.
So we're very excited about what we'll be able to do through Vancouver with that access there particularly due to the size of the facility.
The next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just a bit more on the rail-ship terminal that you've talked about.
When you said it was quicker to -- it was quicker essentially the way that you've optimized it did you mean to build or actually to ship the oil? To build permit and ship.
Research Division</strong> All of the above? Everything.
There's a facility -- the facility basically exists in Vancouver with the rail facilities it's a very highly efficient easy-access facility that's well established.
And we'll invest to put tanks and some piping to get to the marine facilities but all of the infrastructure -- there's a substantial amount of infrastructure there.
So once we permit we'll get access to the market far quicker than we could ever permit to go a facility like this in California.
You couldn't build a facility to handle 280 000 barrels a day of crude oil in California.
Research Division</strong> Sure.
And what is the -- you said 60 a day initially.
When and if you expand where would you go to? Well let me clarify.
The facility the physical capability of the facility when it starts up will be 120 000 barrels a day.
Tesoro has committed for the first 60 000 barrels a day of that 120 000 to start with.
And then the second phase of the project could take it up to 280 000 barrels a day relatively quickly because of the way the infrastructure exists today.
Research Division</strong> My question was if it was expanded how much would you be taking? We haven't determined that yet.
I think we will work through and complete the Carson acquisition and look at our crude supply once that's done.
Research Division</strong> Right.
And if we had a guesstimated cost $9 of rail and $4 of shipping to your California refineries would that be reasonable in the initial phase? And then I guess that would potentially go down in an expansion phase? I think one of the things that we can share is that we've been very public about our cost to -- full cost to Anacortes is about $9.75 a barrel.
The cost to Vancouver is less than $9.75.
And there is $2 to $3 to $4 of shipping cost so that gets your total cost to California.
Research Division</strong> And the -- I was just wondering in general is there a working capital -- I'm not a big one for working questions but here you go is there a working capital implication of the way you're shifting your crude delivery? I mean is there more oil in the systems if you like as a function of the way you're moving? That's a good question Paul.
We actually looked at that in pretty good detail regarding Anacortes.
And there wasn't a significant change when we looked at the amount of oil we committed by rail versus as we said in the past the shipping ANS from -- into Anacortes the working capital impact was not -- there was no impact really.
Research Division</strong> Right Greg.
And then a high-level question.
Your CapEx kind of keeps going up and behind that you've expressed a potential desire to grow the company through acquisitions.
Is there some sort of settling in point or limit that you can give us for where your spending will max out if you like? Yes.
The increase in CapEx that we just talked about today is attributable to our Logistics business.
And we continue to focus on North Dakota because of the -- I mean we have the pipeline system that's kind of a backbone of the gathering and movement of crude up there that can supply the rail loading facilities.
And we're trying to strengthen our position there by building tanks and changing pipeline flows in that to meet the demands of the market there.
And that's been driving some of the increase in capital.
And we will continue to pursue that.
But other than that I think the guidance that we gave at the end of last year in our analyst meeting regarding future capital showed our capital based upon what we knew at the time dropping off particularly income capital.
However we'll continue to look for opportunities to deliver high-value capital projects and we'll look at that when we take over the operations of Carson here.
That's something we'll have to understand the capital opportunities then may be above and beyond what we have said so far.
Research Division</strong> Yes.
And then just finally very quickly on Carson.
You said approval by the end of this quarter? Right.
We expect to close by the end of this quarter.
The next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> I guess you're going to have to answer questions on Carson.
Just I don't know if you can comment.
I mean as you think about the competitive landscape against which the Carson acquisition should be compared it feels like if you look at it against the West Coast it shouldn't be that increased in terms of competition.
But maybe if you just look at California then there might be a different view.
I mean any view as to how you think the FTC should look at that? I mean we've provided Ed everything to respond to the request from the FTC everything that they've asked and they have that information.
So we believe that the -- as we have from the very beginning that the acquisition of the Carson assets by Tesoro actually allows the cost of supply to go down for consumers in the market as well as the other benefits that we've talked about from an environmental standpoint.
Research Division</strong> Right okay.
And then on -- just coming back to major projects I guess it sounds like you're going to have a pause if -- once Carson closes to then rethink about the overall scheduling and obviously doing some great stuff in logistics.
Coming back to maybe Salt Lake and thinking about more ways to get value out of black wax is that still on the agenda? Yes.
I mean we absolutely look at -- with the production profile with the waxy crude and the state of Utah with our capability to process the waxy crude at the refinery with what we're expanding to today.
And then other opportunities it is something that we are very aggressively looking at ways to capture opportunities.
Research Division</strong> Because obviously you could go to down the lubes in group 3 and that's -- the price of those products look quite attractive.
Is that under consideration? We look at it we look at everything.
And we pride ourselves on being able to look at all different possibilities.
Research Division</strong> Right okay.
And then as you've looked at some of the synergies and done the integration are you still pretty confident on the Carson City synergies that you've laid out? Yes.
I think to reiterate what Dan mentioned earlier he's -- Dan has been leading that effort and he stated that we are very confident that those synergies are -- they're all there.
The next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate Bank of America.
Research Division</strong> The types of cars -- sorry it's a question on the Savage deal.
The type of cars that you seem to have put in place is it a priority immediately as to whether you would go for heavy or light crude? I'm kind of thinking about what refinery you might be targeting initially as part of that deal? Yes.
I mean we designed it Doug to have a lot of flexibility.
But our first priority will be to move North Dakota crudes into our system.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So as far as Wilmington is concerned I mean obviously it doesn't sound like you've got any concerns that you won't be allowed to hang onto Wilmington is that fair? Just to restate what I've said before that we believe that as the transaction was proposed we will be able to move forward exactly as the transaction was proposed.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And can you help us -- I guess this is kind of building on Paul's question.
What I'm really trying to get to here is that Wilmington runs a lot of heavy crude right? Right.
Yes it does.
We've said that.
Research Division</strong> Right.
So I'm just trying to figure out is that really where the biggest opportunity could be here in terms of taking heavy Canadian down into Wilmington which may be a little dumb I'm thinking it could be a little bit more impressive by way of benefits than just moving light sweet that's kind of what I'm getting at.
Yes at this point in time we stated that at the Martinez refinery we could run about 50 000 barrels a day of light crude if it's priced competitively from other areas.
And as you correctly stated that Wilmington is a heavy crude processing refinery.
And the supply cost for Wilmington coming out of both California and South America continue to be attractive the differentials from South America net are attractive.
And then the big opportunity is really with what we can do around Carson once we assume operations of that refinery from a crude supply standpoint.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
I just got 2 very quick ones.
In the Bakken I guess differentials have narrowed a fair bit.
And I think that kind of hurt you towards the back end of the quarter.
Can you just walk us through what you're seeing out there now? Because obviously TI-Brent is $10 but as far as we can tell Bakken is a little better than that.
Can you help us with that? Yes.
I'll let Dan respond to your question Doug.
Yes so I think the question Doug is probably how are fuel prices doing relative to what you see on the Clearbrook Trade Center.
Research Division</strong> Basically yes.
Yes.
The fuel prices are actually coming down a little bit quarter-on-quarter relative to the Trade Center Clearbrook.
And we believe -- still remain in the belief that Bakken crude at the field is going to price relative to the coals or [ph] alternative less transportation.
So when TI-Brent starts to come in or TI-LLS Bakken is going to have to move away from TI at the field level and that's what we saw in the quarter.
Research Division</strong> What do you think that number is Dan? Well we've shown $14 under LLS $15 to $16 under Brent is where we expect it to settle at now.
We'll see lumpiness month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter but that's where we think it settles at.
Research Division</strong> Is a part of that short-term move winter-related in other words production coming back after disruptions? It's possible.
I think it's just a commitment on volume that takes periods of times to stabilize as the market moves.
As we've all watched the TI-Brent movement is pretty rapid.
It takes a little bit longer to unwrap the -- to get the same movement moving in the field.
Research Division</strong> And a final one Greg or Dan I'm not sure who wants to take this one.
But going back to that synergy question.
I mean it's quite a while now since you laid out those synergies.
I'm guessing you have a fair amount of time to really have a deeper think about what that could look like.
Your confidence Greg should we read that as risks to the upside on the synergies? And I'll leave it at that.
Yes.
Let me take a shot at that.
We remain very confident in the synergies that we've mentioned.
A level of detail that we can dig into to validate those is restricted but we remain competitors with BP.
So until the transaction closes we can't lift the hood and go deep into it but we were fairly conservative in what we reported.
And we expected to deliver on it.
The next question comes from the line of Evan Calio Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I have a few follow-ups on the JV as well.
I mean in addition to the cost to ship that you outlined I presume there'd also be some yield uplift at least versus ANS that would lower your threshold economics? Would $1 or $2 be reasonable? That would be on the low side depending upon the refinery win at [ph].
As Greg mentioned one of the beauties of the Vancouver terminal is it gives us a choice to go to any of our refineries because they all have great marine facilities.
In the quarter we did actually take advantage to do a brief test run of Bakken actually in Alaska while Anacortes was in turnaround in the month of March.
And it actually came out with a relative refinery value probably at that time closer to the $4 to $5 a barrel advantage up in Alaska.
Down in Carson it's a little bit too early to tell but it's probably going to be at least as good as what we see in Anacortes which is close to a 16% shift oil from fuel oil into clean products.
For the first quarter that math on those prices was in the $2 to $3 barrel range.
Research Division</strong> Great that's significant.
On the new railcars I think you mentioned you are receiving some prior to the facility start up.
Is there some discrepancy? And can we be able to utilize those in some way in the interim.
Meaning that you're getting the cars prior to the 2014 start up? The railcars that we have ordered the additional railcars we've ordered will come in in 2014.
And once that we've locked in on the permitting date and everything it's kind of designed to all coincide together.
But we already have a fleet of railcars that gives us some flexibility that's associated with the Anacortes project Evan.
Research Division</strong> Okay great.
And is there anything more specific on the timing of the expansion? You said reasonably after that but is phase 2 to potentially 2014? Or is that really more of a 2015 project? If you determine to go that far? Yes.
It wouldn't be 2014 because of tankage requirements and that.
It would just -- we'll look as it develops we'll make the determination when the facility is expanded.
The good thing is it has the rail capability and everything in place to be able to accommodate that movement of products.
Research Division</strong> And what the -- I mean assuming that -- will we assume a tariff of $0.75? Is that -- would that be reasonable if you ultimately determine to push these assets into TLLP? Yes.
It's too premature to really come up with those numbers in that yet.
We just -- we -- our total cost like I stated earlier at Anacortes is $9.75 it's less at Vancouver to take the crude oil into Vancouver so that kind of gives you an idea on a relative basis.
Research Division</strong> Yes.
And we kind of got into that.
And then would you expect any kind of knock-on effect? I mean I'm assuming it's ANS that you're pushing out that market? I mean do you see a knock-on effect of loosening up ANS pricing even though that particular crude is exportable? I think one of the things we'll have to look and see what happens is that the -- once we start moving additional crudes to the West Coast and then the impacts on all the different prices particularly as Dan just talked about the yields.
I mean the refiners are going to price the crudes based upon the refinery value.
So there is the potential to have an impact on other crudes going into the West Coast.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then maybe lastly for me if I could.
What was the strategy to partner here versus kind of going it alone at Anacortes? And I'll leave it at that.
Yes.
Savage is a company that's been a very good service provider to Tesoro.
They already provide service to us at our Wilmington refinery our Golden Eagle refinery.
And we use Savage to provide the service for our rail unloading facility at Anacortes.
So they actually operate the rail unloading for us at Anacortes.
And the part of Vancouver was a competitive process at where Tesoro and Savage were selected as a partner to do it.
So we teamed up with Savage because of our experience dealing with them and what they can bring to the table from an operating standpoint.
The next question comes from the line of Jeff Dietert Simmons.
Research Division</strong> Most of my questions have been answered.
But I was hoping to follow-up on your railcar order.
You mentioned in the press release additional coiled and insulated railcars.
Could you talk about how many railcars are associated with that order? And perhaps summarize your railcar orders and delivery schedule more broadly.
We prefer not to disclose exact numbers of railcars.
But a couple of things one is one of the advantages of taking particularly crude oil from North Dakota to the West Coast is a relatively short delivery time so that has an impact on the number of railcars.
You can get from North Dakota to the Pacific Northwest in 3 or 4 days and therein -- the others being is the efficiency of the facilities both at Anacortes and how Vancouver will be.
They are highly highly efficient facilities very environmentally found designed facilities.
And so that efficiency works out very very well and allows us to keep a minimal number of railcars which we design.
So our total railcar requirements for both Anacortes and the first 60 000 barrels a day of crude oil that we've committed to at Vancouver are just we designed it that way.
We don't -- we prefer not to quote exact numbers.
And we've made all the orders for the railcars.
They will be delivered from multiple suppliers during 2014.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And with regard to the U.S.-flag marine capabilities.
You said for the -- this first phase that you've got sufficient capabilities to move the crude.
But you talked about supplemental capacity in the press release.
Would that be associated with the potential for the expansion to 280 000? And would you consider building new railcars yourself or owning -- I'm sorry owning tankers yourself? Or would you look to use third parties in the event of the expansion? Everything we've done so far is that we see adequate capacity to handle the shipping requirements of what we're trying to do so far.
We would -- if we advance to the second stage and take on additional capacity then we'd have to look for additional shipping to meet our needs there.
The next question comes from the line of Roger Read Wells Fargo.
LLC Research Division</strong> I guess just maybe to follow up on the comments earlier about California same-store sales.
I believe you said your fuel sales were up 1%.
Just wondering is that an indication of an improvement in the overall California market? Do you think it's due solely to your locations? Maybe just a little more clarity on that.
Are we finally seeing a turnaround in California? I'll take that one Roger the California market has actually improved and significantly relative to the rest of U.S.A.
[ph] both based upon our stats as well DOE stats which are corrected through February for imports-exports.
So I think DOE stats are now showing PADD V up through February in the neighborhood of 3%.
We're up on a same-store sales basis 1% and going into the second quarter it's looking as good or better.
So I do think we are seeing a turnaround on the West Coast relative to the rest of U.S.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then what are the possibilities as you look at the rail facility to Port Vancouver for running things other than Bakken into that unit? In other words Canadian crudes or something along those lines.
Yes.
The facility in Vancouver will have the capability to handle any type of crude.
LLC Research Division</strong> And would there ever be a possibility of bringing WTI in there in terms of where the rail lines are laid out? Or is that going to be more of a Southern California thing? Yes.
I mean you just have to look at wherever the economics are.
So if there are economics to do that and you can get access to it you -- there are no limitations on that.
The beauty of coming from the northern part into Vancouver is that you have a straight shot on the rail lines with one railroad.
LLC Research Division</strong> Right.
I just didn't know what sort of flexibility you might have in the system in choosing that location.
The next question comes from the line of Ann Kohler Imperial Capital.
LLC Research Division</strong> A couple of questions on Hawaii.
Will there be any ongoing costs or charges related to that asset now that it's closed going forward? Well the actual refinery is being shutdown.
And as we mentioned it will be transitioned over into a distribution facility.
And there will be costs associated with running it as a distribution facility.
LLC Research Division</strong> And will that show up -- How should we be modeling that? Should that be in the refining division and what are those costs? Or will it be -- I guess at this point you're not looking at dropping that down you're looking to sell that facility.
So I guess how should I model that going forward? Yes I would expect to see that in the refining segment still.
I don't know that you should plan in modeling any great amount of profitability there.
LLC Research Division</strong> How about cost? Or cost.
And it's in the cost guidance we've given you.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay perfect.
And then just in regards to that facility.
Are you at this point actively marketing the assets or where do we stand on that? Yes we are actively marketing the assets in Hawaii still.
The next question comes from the line of Clay Rynd Tudor Pickering Holt.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.
Research Division</strong> Just back on rail in Anacortes.
You said post-turnaround you expect to ramp to 50 000 barrels a day.
Was the issue with ramping to the nameplate capacity more an issue at the facility? Or was it kind of a logistical issue along the railways? Well all along we were ramping up.
And I think we were in the 40s before we went to the turnaround.
But we're just managing the process to go into an extensive full plant turnaround as we said in the first part of the quarter here.
And so we'll ramp up to 50 000 barrels a day here post-turnaround.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.
Research Division</strong> Okay perfect.
And then one more thing.
On -- you repurchased $45 million of stock in April pretty much do you kind of expect that rate to continue? Or do you expect to slowdown as you kind of get to the BP acquisition and other things? We've guided before that we continue to expect to complete the $500 million repurchase by the end of 2013.
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan Citigroup.
Research Division</strong> I think you mentioned a number of different economics in railing crudes for the Bakken to the West Coast system.
I was wondering if you could just give us a threshold sort of spread between the Bakken and ANS including kind of the quality uplift? At what point you would sort of stop railing crude into the West Coast if the differentials sort of converged or narrowed? Well we would stop running it to the West Coast when we didn't make any money doing it I mean to be direct.
But I think maybe just to take a step back and put it into perspective the cost for Tesoro to go from Bakken to Anacortes is around $9.75 a barrel total cost.
When Vancouver is up and running it will be less than $9.75 so that's the total cost.
Secondly as Dan stated at Anacortes the value to the refinery of processing Bakken crude oil relative to ANS is $2 to $3 a barrel advantage to doing that.
And so that's additive to what we see there.
So the advantage to be able to move it there is pretty significant relative to the differentials.
We firmly believe that the level of production in the Bakken today and the growth -- projected growth in production puts a lot of supply in the market that needs to clear the market.
And the way that clears the market is to go to the refining centers -- coastal refining centers.
And that is at the end of the day over time is going to dictate what that differential is.
And so therefore as we look at it unless someone comes up with an alternative that's far more cost-effective to get it to a refiner versus rail that's going to be -- the ultimate differentials that were stated a little bit earlier are going to stay in place over time which gives us a continued advantage to move the crude oil to our West Coast system.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So it sounds like including the quality and transportation differentials the spread would have to collapse to something below $5 before it wouldn't make economic sense to move that crude? In that range in that range.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then you mentioned something about the obviously the quality of Bakken crude.
It's a huge yield uplift to the refiners your refiners in the West Coast.
But at what point do you think that people start pricing in the quality of the crude? Because so far it's been just a volumetric issue.
And then there was a bit of volumetric constraints.
But no one is pricing in the quality of this crude quite yet.
I mean do you think that that factor plays into the economics in the near term? Or is that just so far out it doesn't really matter right now? Maybe I'll take a shot at that.
The actual value for uplift is refinery-specific.
So I don't think it's fair to take what we see as an opportunity and extrapolate that across the West Coast.
Anacortes is a bit of a unique animal because of the fuel make.
Alaska is a completely different case and Carson has got some unique advantages.
So I guess our view is that the quality differential pricing will be a ways out.
Research Division</strong> Okay understood.
And just on the uplift in EBITDA that you guys stated in your prepared remarks for the Salt Lake Conversion Project.
I think you did talk a little bit about your underlying assumptions for the project.
If you can just repeat them one more time what are those underlying sort of expectations again in generating that EBITDA? Sure.
It was made up of about 3 components.
Cost advantage on the waxy crude I don't believe we gave the actual contractual pieces of that because it's confidential.
The second piece is the improved yields associated with the waxy crude.
And the third piece is an improvement in the actual throughput which is a particularly a great piece.
The total value proposition was a bit north of $100 million annually based upon historic average type differentials in the Salt Lake City area.
This first phase comes on we believe towards -- or we're planning on towards end of May.
And we'll be ramping up to about 50% of the value gain until towards the end of next year when we bring on phase 2.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And just to understand I understand that the deal is confidential in terms of how the crude is priced.
But it's priced off of WTI is that correct? That's correct.
Research Division</strong> And then is there an implied economic on the WTI a less differential in that $100 million? Yes.
There is an improvement relative to TI that acknowledges the capital investment.
Research Division</strong> Okay understood.
And then on the Vancouver rail project what permits do you have and what permits are remaining? Well in Vancouver it's a new operation for us.
So we need to fully permit the project.
And so we're in the process of doing that.
Research Division</strong> Is it state permits? Or is it also federal permits that you need as well? It will be primarily state to my knowledge.
But this is going to be very similar to what we did in Anacortes.
It took us I think if I recall correctly close to 5 months to get those permits pulled together.
As you may be aware you're not fully and totally in self-control of that permit process but the good news is we've got a lot of folks excited with us on this journey.
So we're looking forward to getting those permits in the fourth quarter that's our target.
Research Division</strong> Okay got it.
Just on the financial statements in the last couple of years your deferred tax benefit has been relatively small.
But with the big turnaround expenses in the CapEx this year what are your expectations for deferred tax benefit between '13? This is Scott.
You would expect them to go up a little bit but nothing material.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Got it.
And then just one last question.
On your -- on the Jones Act tankers that you guys talked about.
Do you own the tankers or do you lease your tankers? Lease.
The next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez Howard Weil.
Research Division</strong> I had to hop off earlier so I apologize if this was covered or asked.
But I was curious Greg when I saw there was an open season from Kinder Morgan on the pipeline from the Permian to the West Coast I guess I felt like you guys were a natural participant in that.
And then of course you subsequently announced the Savage deal.
I'm curious if you could just talk about maybe how that project would compare cost-wise? And if there's maybe a potential to also participate in that project? Yes.
One of the limitations of a pipeline project is that it takes away all your flexibility to supply your refinery because of the long-term and volumetric commitment to the pipeline which doesn't make it very attractive.
And from our standpoint I don't know if you caught this or not earlier Blake I don't know the -- how the open season will be on tariffs and that.
But we need the flexibility to have access to different crudes not just a particular crude that would come from the Permian basin up to Southern California.
Research Division</strong> Okay okay got it.
And then Greg I did catch earlier that I think you said you'd be probably exhausting the share buyback program by year-end '13.
I presume at some point here the board would contemplate extending that or coming up with a new program? We'll continue as you know it's our strategy to look to return cash to shareholders over time.
So as we go -- we're going through a pretty active period here now when we close on the Carson acquisition we close on the Chevron project pipeline acquisition and start doing all that.
And we'll relook -- take a forward look at that down the road here when it's appropriate.
There are no further questions.
Thank you for joining today's conference.
This concludes the presentation.
You may now disconnect.
Good day.
