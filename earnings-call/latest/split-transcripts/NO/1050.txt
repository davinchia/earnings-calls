Good morning.
Welcome to the Noble Energy's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.
I would now like to turn the call over to David Larson.
Please go ahead.
Thanks Camille.
Good morning everyone.
Welcome to Noble Energy's first quarter 2013 earnings call and webcast.
On the call today we have Chuck Davidson Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover President and COO; and Ken Fisher CFO.
This morning we issued our earnings release for the first quarter and it is available on our website.
Later today we expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC and it will also be available on our website.
The agenda for today will begin with Chuck discussing the quarter and followed by an update of our Eastern Mediterranean business and highlights of our ongoing Exploration program.
Dave will then give a detailed overview of our operational programs and near-term plans.
We'll leave time for Q&amp;A at the end and plan to wrap up the call in less than an hour.
[Operator Instructions] I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current views and most reasonable expectations.
We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in the future periods to differ materially from what we discuss here.
You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that influence our business.
We'll also be referencing certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow on the call today.
When we refer to these items it's because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance.
Be sure to see the reconciliation in our earnings release tables.
With that let me turn the call over to Chuck.
Thanks David.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.
I have to say right upfront that it looks like we're off to a great start for the year.
As we go over our results and outlook during this call I'm sure you'll reach the same conclusion.
My list of highlights for the quarter include strong earnings and strong cash flow as well as solid production all of which came in a bit higher than we expected.
But certainly surpassing all of these was a surprise of experiencing the Tamar startup late in the quarter.
Not only did Tamar start up a few weeks early it then almost immediately began setting records for gas sales to Israel.
A smooth and successful start up of Tamar really sets the stage for us for a great 2013.
The projects of the scale and complexity of Tamar are not easy to execute much less execute under a compressed schedule that resulted in going from discovery to production in just 4 years.
The project performance we've delivered at Aseng in West Africa and now Tamar in Israel are showcasing an emerging Noble competitive advantage and that is the ability to consistently deliver major projects on schedule and on budget.
So this morning I'll highlight what I believe has been an excellent quarter.
I'll review the financial results and then I'll touch upon the outlook for the upcoming quarters before turning the call over to Dave who will provide a more detailed operational outlook.
So let's look at our performance for the quarter.
Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $269 million or $1.48 per share diluted.
Excluded from adjusted net income were unrealized losses from commodity hedges and gains on some non-core asset divestments in the first quarter.
Revenues were $1.1 billion for the quarter supported by another quarter of strong crude realizations.
Our sales volumes for the quarter were 245 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 39% were crude and condensate volumes.
Volumes for the quarter were significantly above the high end of our guidance due to stronger-than-expected performance in Israel the Gulf of Mexico and the DJ Basin.
Adjusting for divestments our year-over-year volume growth was 9% and the growth was almost entirely due to increased crude oil volumes from the DJ Basin.
Domestic sales totaled 146 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day up 23% from the first quarter of 2012 excluding volumes from divested assets.
Domestic results for the quarter exceeded our expectations as a result of the horizontal program in the DJ Basin and the faster return to production of Swordfish in the Gulf of Mexico.
Internationally sales volumes were 99 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day down 6% from the first quarter of 2012 but above our expectations due to stronger-than-expected volumes from Noa and Pinnacles in Israel which delivered net production of 110 million cubic feet equivalent per day.
As expected West Africa sales volumes were down due to scheduled underliftings.
Our discretionary cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $761 million up 10% from the first quarter of 2012.
Our liquidity position remains extremely strong at more than $5.3 billion with $1.3 billion of cash on hand.
Also in the quarter we made progress on our non-core asset divestment program.
We closed 2 divestment packages one in the North Sea and one consisting of some Gulf Coast assets and received proceeds of approximately $90 million.
We also signed a sales agreement on a package of Mid-Continent gas assets that is expected to close in the second quarter.
We expect to divest of some additional non-core assets later this year as well.
As I look forward to the rest of the year I'm excited about the operational successes that we're experiencing.
Onshore we're on track to drill 300 wells this year in the DJ Basin and we're testing various horizontal lateral patterns across several target zones to increase our recovery per section.
We're drilling longer laterals than we have ever had done before and we're seeing some extended-reach lateral well production curves that now appear to be tracking an estimated ultimate recovery curve of 1 million barrels of oil equivalent.
In the Marcellus we plan to drill 120 wells this year in cooperation with our joint venture partner CONSOL.
Our emphasis remains in the wet gas area where we anticipate adding rigs this year to support the program.
In our offshore business units our appraisal program support scheduled sanctions for later this year.
I believe that one of the reasons we have been so successful in bringing our major projects to production on schedule is that our appraisal programs have allowed us to design a properly sized and effective development scenarios.
In the Gulf of Mexico we expect to complete our appraisal well at Gunflint during the second quarter.
We do expect that in the coming weeks we'll be penetrating a deeper exploration target previously untested on the Gunflint structure which if successful provides significant upside.
Following our drilling and analysis there we would expect the sanction a development at Gunflint later this year.
Following Gunflint we plan to spud exploration wells at Troubadour and another prospect before the end of the year.
We also plan to sanction a second development in the Gulf of Mexico in our Big Bend discovery by year-end.
In West Africa our land project continues to follow an accelerated plan targeting a third quarter startup and Dave will provide you an update on our progress there.
We're drilling a second appraisal well at Carla and working towards a sanction of a project there later this year.
Following Carla we plan to begin an appraisal at Diega.
Looking more closely at the Eastern Mediterranean programs I was in Israel recently and can really see the impact of our efforts there.
We're supplying natural gas to Israel at a higher rate than we ever have before.
In fact we tested the field that delivery is equivalent to over 950 million cubic feet per day.
We expect the facility to deliver at full capacity during the peak summer demand period in the third quarter and Dave will fill you in on some of the details on our operations at Tamar later in the call.
Israel Electric Corporation recently exercised its option to increase the amount of natural gas it will purchase from Tamar.
This further supports the need to initiate a second phase of Tamar soon.
The new coalition government was recently formed in Israel and the new leaders are becoming familiar with the items on their country's energy policy agenda which includes energy exports.
Our expectation is that the export policy is one of the early issues that the new government will be addressing.
Clarity on an export policy is essential as we finalize the farmout agreement with Woodside which in turn will bring us closer to sanctioning the first phase at Leviathan.
On the exploration front we finished an appraisal well during the quarter at Leviathan which increased our gross mean resource estimate there at the field to 18 trillion cubic feet.
Coupled with the announced increase and resource estimates at Tamar these 2 fields gross mean resources now total 28 trillion cubic feet.
With necessary government support we anticipate sanctioning Leviathan later this year.
We're currently drilling our Karish prospect offshore Israel which is a 3 Tcf prospect.
Our analysis and modeling has verified through our earlier successes and we believe this well has a very high chance of success.
Following Karish we plan to move over to Cyprus and spud an appraisal well at our 7 Tcf Cyprus discovery.
With respect to our new ventures exploration programs we completed 3D seismic surveys in 2 different sections of our tight oil play in Northeast Nevada late last year.
We're finishing our analysis and plan to initiate our vertical test program in the third quarter.
Bear in mind this is exploration drilling not factory drilling like we're accustomed to in the DJ Basin.
This will be slower drilling especially initially but we expect to have some preliminary results later this year.
We have a 100% working interest in our 350 000 net acre position.
We're on track to spud our first exploration well an appraisal prospect offshore Nicaragua in the third quarter.
We secured a drilling rig and are actively evaluating bid proposals on this world-class exploration opportunity and anticipate farming down our ownership before spudding the well.
We expect the farm-down to include our entire acreage position which has multiple prospects identified.
Appraisal alone may contain 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
We estimate the entire acreage position has a gross unrisked resource of nearly 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
We personally hold a 100% working interest and expect the farm-down to a level of 40% to 50% interest.
In the Falkland Islands we've acquired almost 1.5 million acres of 3D seismic.
In Sierra Leone we're completing an initial 2D seismic survey of our acreage which will direct the future 3D program.
And finally our new build drillship should arrive on location in the Eastern Mediterranean around year-end with a spud of our deep Mesozoic oil prospect below the Leviathan field.
In closing the first quarter served as an excellent start to the year and we really remain well-positioned to deliver on our expectations for the year and beyond as we continue with this period of very significant growth.
Earlier this week we announced that we have increased our quarterly dividend by 12% as well as announcing a 2-for-1 stock split.
These actions reflect our confidence in our ability to execute on the plans we've previously communicated to you.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave who will provide some more details on our ongoing operations.
Thank you Chuck.
As you mentioned we had an exciting quarter in the Eastern Mediterranean as we began production at Tamar.
Late last month we initiated flow from the Tamar field through the world's longest subsea tied back to the platform and then to the Ashdod Onshore Terminal.
It took less than a week to bring on all 5 subsea wells and stabilize flow which was a remarkable feat by our project team.
Each of the 5 wells has been cycled up to the design capacity of 250 million cubic feet per day.
With the startup we shifted over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved undeveloped reserves -- with proved developed reserves and we increased the gross mean resource estimate of Tamar by 1 trillion cubic feet to 10 trillion cubic feet total.
Looking forward we plan to continue producing from our fields at Mari-B Noa and Pinnacles until they are depleted.
As they continue to deplete we will ramp up Tamar volumes as necessary to support the Israel demand.
We've seen strong demand and expect it to increase as we enter the peak summer season.
At times in the third quarter it seems likely that we will deliver up to the maximum capacity of the development which is approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day.
We're working to sanction the second phase of Tamar which will increase the system capacity to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day by 2015.
The capacity increase will be through a combination of increased compression system optimization and the use of storage at the existing Mari-B reservoir.
As Chuck commented Israel Electric Corporation exercised its option to purchase additional natural gas beginning in 2015.
The second phase will support the additional sales.
With respect to exploration we're drilling the Karish prospect in Israel followed by our first appraisal well in Cyprus.
The drillship Atwood Advantage will be mobilizing to the Eastern Mediterranean late in the year and is targeted to spud the Mesozoic oil prospect beneath Leviathan.
As I've mentioned a number of times I can't wait to test this breakout play concept and look forward to having the capability of this new drillship.
In West Africa Aseng production was nearly 60 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross with decline expected to start this quarter.
At our non-operated asset Elba we expect some planned maintenance downtime this quarter.
Our next big operated project Alen is progressing very well.
I'm confident this will be our fourth major project in a row with outstanding execution.
Platform installation was completed by the same vessel that installed the Tamar platform the [indiscernible].
Subsea installation and commissioning is complete.
Major hookups are approximately 80% complete and facilities commissioning is approximately 40% complete.
The Alen development is now scheduled for first production in the third quarter with production ramping up to 18 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net.
The condensate volumes at Alen will be transported via a pipeline to the Aseng FPSO for offloading.
In Carla we completed appraisal of a well in Block O.
Following a planned sidetrack we flow-tested 2 separate zones.
The test confirmed that both zones are productive one with oil the other with condensate.
Earlier this month we spud another well to test similar objectives to the south in Block I.
Results are expected near the end of the quarter and we will be analyzing development options for a potential sanction later in the year.
One scenario is to flow Carla to the Aseng FPSO via subsea tiebacks.
Shifting over to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico we restored production of Swordfish following some unplanned downtime.
We will be replacing an umbilical there next month resulting in 2 weeks of downtime and we'll also be impacted by about a month of downtime at Galapagos for planned maintenance at the host platform.
We recently increased our working interest in Gunflint to 31% from 26% and are currently drilling our second appraisal well.
This well should complete our appraisal drilling and will help determine our development plan.
There is a deep exploration zone to this well which if successful can result in a standalone development.
We expect results late second quarter or early third quarter with a possible sanction to follow later in the year.
Following the Gunflint appraisal we plan to drill the offset to our Big Bend discovery at Troubadour.
If successful Troubadour would likely be another subsea tieback similar to Big Bend.
We expect to sanction Big Bend this year and is possible that Troubadour could be sanctioned at the same time and codeveloped with Big Bend.
Following Troubadour we plan to spud another exploration well.
We have a number of potential candidates.
We'll be maintaining a one-rig program in the Gulf of Mexico through the end of the year.
Moving onshore our domestic production continues to be led by our growing DJ Basin program as shown in Slide 5 of the packet.
For the quarter sales from the DJ Basin averaged 92 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day an increase of 7% over the fourth quarter and 25% over the first quarter last year.
This month we have been impacted by a series of spring snowstorms which has affected our ability to move volumes and bring on new production.
We've taken that into account in our second quarter guidance.
The horizontal program contributed 45 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 49% of the first quarter DJ production.
This progress is amazing when you consider first quarter last year we averaged 18 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the horizontal activity.
We continue to see the impact of the increased oil production from this program as crude oil accounted for 49% of the production for the quarter.
Total liquids volumes were 63% of production with natural gas accounting for the remaining 37%.
We continue to expand our drilling activity as we recently added our ninth horizontal rig in March and plan to add our tenth rig later this quarter.
We spud 56 horizontal wells in the first quarter of which 10 were extended-reach laterals.
Our extended-reach lateral wells continue to perform extremely well.
We'll drill approximately 60 wells this year with lateral lengths generally between 6 500 and 9 500 feet.
As shown on Slide 6 we now have substantial production history on 4 wells that averaged 9 100 feet and the average production is tracking well above the 750 000-barrel of oil equivalent type curve.
It's interesting to point out that 2 of the wells are tracking at a 1 million-barrel type curve.
This highlights how far the transformation this field has come when you think back just 3 years ago and the average new vertical well was started getting 40 000 barrels of oil equivalent per well.
Slide 7 shows production curves of 5 wells with an average lateral length approaching 7 000 feet.
These production curves are tracking above a 540 000-barrel of oil equivalent type curve.
We recently finished drilling 8 extended-reach lateral wells in one section with 7 of the 8 laterals extending beyond 7 000 feet.
The wells are currently being completed and we expect initial production from all 8 late in the second quarter.
We continue to push this program and a fact we believe we have drilled the longest lateral in the State of Colorado at 9 978 feet.
With respect to our ongoing pilot programs we're testing recoveries for multiple zones in various lateral patterns as shown on Slide 8.
What we have learned up to this point is that we need a minimum of 16 wells per section in the oil window to drain the B Bench of the Niobrara.
We've also learned that the entire 300-foot section from the Niobrara A through the Codell is productive and it is apparent that more than one well is required to vertically drain the 300-foot section.
It also appears that the B Bench performs as expected even with tightly spaced wells in the A Bench C Bench and the Codell.
We continue to focus on additional pilot testing in an effort to understand the optimum recovery plan with respect to density lateral length multiple zones and zone patterns.
We're testing a handful of different patterns across the oil window and we have several more on the drawing board.
We're doing this while drilling our crude oil production significantly and continuing to accelerate the pace of our horizontal development.
We see significant upside to our recoverable resource numbers which are currently based on an average of approximately 10 wells per section.
Further north we're actively developing our 45 000 net acre East Pony area as shown on Slide 9.
We now have 27 wells on production and we'll be drilling between 50 and 60 wells there this year.
These wells continue to generate 80% crude oil and are among the highest returning assets in our portfolio.
Outside of East Pony we're working to delineate our remaining 185 000 net acre position in Northern Colorado.
With respect to crude oil infrastructure infield oil gathering trunk line is scheduled to begin service with an initial capacity of 50 000 barrels per day in September.
This line will help us deliver crude oil efficiently to the White Cliffs Pipeline and the plain's rail facility.
The rail facility is scheduled to begin service in the third quarter of this year with a capacity of 68 000 barrels per day.
The rail facility diversifies our sales portfolio and gives us market options to the Gulf Coast the West Coast or the East Coast.
The White Cliffs pipeline capacity will essentially be doubled when the loop of the existing line is completed in the second quarter of next year.
On the gas side DCP is bringing on the LaSalle plant in September of this year which will initially add 110 million cubic feet per day and then will be expanded in the fourth quarter to 160 million cubic feet per day of total processing capacity of that facility.
The 230 million cubic feet per day Lucerne [ph] 2 plants that's scheduled for service in 2014 followed by another 230 million cubic feet per day plant in 2015.
Also our Kyoto gas plant is scheduled for startup in the third quarter of 2014 with a processing capacity of 30 million cubic feet per day.
This plant alongside the Lilli Plant will support our growth in Northern Colorado.
Next to our Kyoto plant we'll be building the state's first LNG facility and we'll be supplying our rigs and frac fleets with a clean fuel source from our own operated facility.
These efforts give us confidence on our ability to continue to bring our production to market and we expect another year of significant growth from the DJ Basin.
Moving over to the Marcellus we're operating 3 rigs in the wet gas area.
Currently we have 2 rigs operating in Majorsville and 1 rig operating in the Normantown area of West Virginia.
In Majorsville we have 20 wells on production from 3 pads.
Completion operations are finishing up at our fourth pad the 11-well WEB 4 pad which we'll bring into production in late June.
Our fifth and sixth pads the 10-well SHL 8 and the 7-well WFN 1 are finishing drilling operations soon and are scheduled to begin completion operations in June.
In Normantown we're breaking out a new development area.
We've taken a core and our analysis will guide our development going forward.
We'll be completing drilling operations at our first Normantown pad a 6-well pad around mid-May.
We'll begin completion operations there in late June.
We'll be adding a fourth rig to our wet gas operations in the second quarter.
This rig will be utilized to break out another development area in Pennsboro West Virginia.
We also intend to add 2 more rigs to the wet gas area later in the year to support drilling a total of 85 to 90 wet gas wells this year.
The current plan for 2013 has our partner CONSOL drilling 35 dry gas wells.
The second order -- in the second quarter CONSOL intends to bring 2 pads to production.
Let me talk about our volume guidance before we open the call for questions.
Our full-year volume guidance remains unchanged at 270 000 to 282 000 barrels per day and we expect second-quarter volumes to be 254 000 to 260 000 barrels per day.
Second-quarter volumes will be up over the first quarter primarily due to production from Tamar.
Offsetting some of the increase are about 2 000 barrels per day impact from divestments of non-core onshore assets and another 10 000 barrels per day from items I mentioned earlier including planned downtime in Equatorial Guinea and the Gulf of Mexico along with the early quarter weather in the DJ Basin.
The second half of the year is expected to average around 300 000 barrels per day sales with increased demand at Israel startup of Alen and accelerated ramp up in the DJ and the Marcellus wet gas programs.
This mix of catalysts will allow us to deliver on our full-year volume guidance while absorbing some ongoing non-core asset sales.
In summary both Chuck and I have discussed the activity that underpins our confidence in delivering the exceptional growth we've outlined late last year.
The execution of the Tamar project and the progress on Alen continues to highlight the organization's ability to execute major projects and deliver on our promises.
Our appraisal activity this year at Leviathan Gunflint Carla and Cyprus along with significant exploration wells in the Gulf of Mexico Nicaragua Eastern Mediterranean and Nevada provide additional catalyst.
All combined with expanding and growing programs in our onshore core areas provides an exciting year and a tremendous future.
Camille it is now time to go ahead and open the call for questions.
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> A question in the Niobrara I know you completed 44 wells versus a 300 annual target.
Should we expect the completions to be back-end loaded? And can you help me understand the pace on the completion side? And I have a follow-up.
Well the completions as somewhat has expected were a little less than average in the first quarter with some of the weather.
But with -- as we mentioned we're bringing in -- we've actually brought another rig in March and we've got another rig coming in this quarter.
So that activity will continue to ramp up through the year.
And it won't be so much back-end loaded they will be continual I'd say from this point forward.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And my follow-up or second question is I know you gave us a lot of data on Slide 9 on Northern Colorado.
Do you have any color on the wells drilled outside of East Pony? And kind of what were the number of wells drilled outside that area within the quarter? I'll leave with that.
No.
I'd say still too early for that.
We're just starting on some of that delineation up there.
So that'll be towards the end of the year before we really have a lot of new insight on some of these what I call appraisal areas.
And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Research Division</strong> Dave could I just ask you to elaborate a little bit on your plans for the Phase 2 at Tamar? And I guess what's behind my question is I think in Chuck's prepared remarks he talked about the sort of greater urgency to get that onstream quicker perhaps.
Could you maybe just give us an update as to how you see the timeline there? And if you could perhaps clarify some of the government noise around gas prices as it relates to future expansions for both that and Leviathan please? And I have a quick follow-up.
Sure Doug.
First on the second phase of Tamar Tamar is -- that phase is a combination of utilizing compression that we would install onshore as well as the utilization of Mari-B for storage.
And that's why it gives us that big uplift in capacity.
I think Dave noted that it would raise the capacity to about 1.5 billion although we again just like at Tamar right now we wouldn't expect to be able to average at that level but it raises the peak capacity.
Again the key is well storage as well as compression to get there.
And again that project is expected to be ready to come onstream in 2015 and is actually needed to support the Israel Electric exercise of their option to expand their gas take.
So all of that is tied together.
Our contract with Israel Electric provided for that option to expand and the pricing has already been set in that.
So when it gets to pricing in Israel really we've got multiple contracts that have already gone through the government review and approval.
So it's hard for me to really comment on any other things that are maybe just more speculative in the media.
We're very confident in terms of what our pricing is for our Tamar project.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
My follow-up hopefully quite quick.
Are you now back funding the carry in the Marcellus? And if not can you give us an idea when you might be starting to pay for that? And I'll leave it there.
Well just -- it's always hard to speculate on the forward curve but again the contract provides that once Henry Hub prices average above $4 for 3 months then our carry would come back on.
So if we look at the forward curve we would expect that perhaps sometime in the third quarter the carry would begin again.
So it's -- we're enjoying the benefits of the increased gas prices and I would just say once again is we really like that structure in the contract and really protected us and aligned our partnership when we went through this period of very low gas prices.
And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
L.L.C.
Research Division</strong> Two questions for me on the Wattenberg.
First I know on the graphs you guys have put out showing the -- your well results versus type curve.
I know in the past you have shown those as a rolling 3-day average but I guess I'm just -- it struck me little more this time that given the volatility in that line and recognizes that rolling 3-day average that there's a lot a volatility that's hidden in there.
And I'm wondering if you could kind of explain that.
Is that and I'm thinking maybe one possible explanation is that sales rather than production? Yes that's exactly what it is Charles.
That sale that has loads are being lifted from the tank.
L.L.C.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
That's very good and easy and comforting explanation.
And then the next point which follows that or the next question rather I think it's clear to most people who are following your story that you guys have a huge amount of inventory drilling inventory here.
16 wells in a section just in the Niobrara B.
But where do you think you are -- I imagine first you have to identify the resource then you have some idea of ranking the opportunities on a present value to cap and then at some point you're driving efficiencies to bring value forward.
Where is most of your focus falling now on those kind of 3 areas if you agree of looking at that way? Charles we're approaching it on let's call it at least 3 fronts.
I mean this is outside of the other appraisal effort going on in Northern Colorado.
But if you think about it you go back to what we're looking at the aerial recovery which is that number of wells per section in just the B interval alone if you start with that and optimizing that on different parts of the field from Northern Colorado to the Greater Wattenberg oil portion.
We're testing this vertical recovery.
In other words the impact of the A the C and the Codell relative to the B and then the other piece is this long lateral.
If you start and you look at it these long laterals seem to improve efficiency as we go with the 7 000 type or the 9 000.
So it kind of starts with where can we fit in the long laterals and how do we do that in a way that we can improve our vertical recovery on some of this? So those are the things we're continuing to test as we develop this field out and evaluate these different patterns if you will.
If you noticed on that one slide we showed some of the different pattern possibilities we're looking at.
That's not all of them.
That's an example of some that we're continuing to test and we'll be testing this year as we move through that answer to answer that specific question that you posed.
L.L.C.
Research Division</strong> And which of the -- I'm sorry to interrupt but which of those 3 between the C the B the vertical -- or vertically in the column and the long laterals do you think is most important to you Dave? Well I think the real next breakthrough out here if you will will be the improved vertical recovery.
In other words how do you tie in the A and the C and the Codell with what you knows there in the B.
I think the key is that clearly some patterns work better than others.
And that is I mean that's -- that could be the key to really unlocking the optimal development.
And we have to recognize there's geology at work here so that what works in one area we might change in another area.
So this is not just poking holes in the ground.
It's a really good problem to work and we're excited on it.
And like you'd say we've got a huge inventory there and we're going down a path of really trying to make it as efficient as possible while improving the recovery.
But all of those pieces are important.
And that's we're tying in the 3D seismic and everything is important here too as you do optimize different patterns across the field.
It won't be one-size-fits-all as Chuck says.
Our next -- take our question from Leo Mariani with RBC.
LLC Research Division</strong> Just a quick question for any super extended laterals that you've got here in the DJ.
Wanted to get a sense of where you have tested those what sort of coverage on your acreage have you seen with the SXL test.
And additionally just wanted to get a sense of the progression of the EURs.
Obviously you kind of look like you've stepped these numbers up a little bit with some of your recent wells.
Are these wells kind of continuing to get better as you drill more and more of these and you guys are hopefully kind of optimizing or refining your techniques sir? I think we have.
I mean to your point Leo I think we've definitely seen improvement over the last year or 2 in how we bring wells on how we maintain kind of a steady production if you will as we've seen on these -- especially the super long laterals as we've seen on these.
Most of these so far have been up in that wells ranch type area that Greater Wattenberg oil portion up there.
But it was about 50 or 60 of these to drill this year we're going to start to test some of this in some other areas.
And again a lot of it gets back to the geology on this and especially tying in some of this 3D and making sure that we stay in zone and not crossing fault and things.
And that's where that becomes really important in helping to direct and lay out your well pattern well plan.
So I'd say what we have been encouraged especially when you look at the decline or the slow rate of decline on some of these extended laterals as you get further out in time.
So the more information we've gotten I'd say as we started to see that we got beyond those 90 days and gotten into 180 days and beyond that was real encouraging on these extended reach.
LLC Research Division</strong> Okay.
And I guess obviously you mentioned some of your best wells could be approaching upwards of 1 million Boe per well you guys could achieve results in that neighborhood.
I mean what kind of improvement you think you'd see in economics versus 5 000-foot laterals out here? Well I think just given indicative numbers.
We already showed that our extended reach laterals at about the 750 were 100% rates of return.
And even the normal lateral wells were very good rates of return as well.
So looking at a 9 000-foot where maybe guessing well north of 100% 125% 130% rates of return.
That's just all numbers.
I back off from this whole development and think about it a different way and that is an area where we have an opportunity and a plan to invest 10 -- a billions of dollars.
As we announced last year over 5 years perhaps $10 billion in this area at rates of return of 70% 80% 90% 100%.
That is going to create huge value and growth for our company because it's rare that you can invest that amount of capital at these higher rates of return.
But it's all about improving it and that's really what your question was directed at I'm sure.
LLC Research Division</strong> That's exactly right.
And just one brief follow-up here.
I think Dave you mentioned impacting 2Q production by 2 000 barrels a day as a result of the asset sale.
I think you also said that some of the sales are going to close in the second quarter.
So I was just trying to get a sense of what the impact could be maybe in 3Q if you're going to lose a little bit of initial production as a result of those asset sales that you've already announced here.
Yes.
I think when we're looking at it on a full year basis and I said we're going to absorb some of these onshore non-core asset sales I mean you're looking at absorbing a couple of thousand barrels for full year type of piece.
And we'll take our next question from Joe Magner with Macquarie Capital.
Just I wanted to clarify the 10-well current spacing I guess assumptions that support your resource.
Is there a breakdown on which zones or which types of wells are included in that 10 wells or is that all assumed to be in the B Bench? I'm just trying to clarify where...
Yes that goes back to what we showed in December that presentation.
So that was for that full acreage position up there and we -- if you go back to that I think we broke it down where on average that came up to what 67 acres per well.
And that included what we had looked at at that time.
In the Greater Wattenberg oil we were on a little bit less than 50-acre spacing assumption for probably 6 400 locations over -- almost 2/3 of our locations and about 80-acre assumption down in the gas portion.
And then in Northern Colorado at that time we were using the assumption of a little over 80-acre spacing up there for the location.
So we had broke that down in December and that's where that comes from.
I think when you start looking at trying to differentiate between the A the B and the C and Codell at that point we were just looking at recoveries per section.
And I think what Dave pointed to is now that we're really working the patterns and looking at the different pattern developments that's what's causing us to focus in and in some areas will probably give us an idea of how many would be in the B and how many would be in the A and how many would be in the C.
I just keep focusing on is how many wells a section because if you can -- if you're looking at a minimum of 16 per section in some of these areas versus 10 to 4 that gives you an idea of directionally where this is going from a resource standpoint from a recovery standpoint.
Okay.
So truly the step up from it was 10 it's gone to at least 16 and you're testing things that might -- testing other ideas that might take it to 32 that sort of the progression.
Yes when you start to roll in potential for staggered or multiple laterals at different intervals through this thing.
But keep in mind that we've got areas in Northeastern Colorado they're still in appraisal and those would be outside of the scope of that.
This is more talking about the more concentrated developed area of Wattenberg extended Wattenberg that we really defined here.
Okay.
And not to overplay just to clarify one more thing.
On this Wells Ranch pad there were 3 different spacing concepts that were being targeted.
The support today for the 16 per section is that based on that center pad the B that was being tested on 40-acre spacing or was it the results of all that work that was being done there just trying to...
Yes I mean really if you go back to what was rolled into that scenario at that point in time when we built that resource space it was for all intents and purposes it was a B development for 16 wells per section.
So all the rest of this is testing upsides to that.
And I think that just is reflected also as we've looked at those closely spaced wells in the B Bench that's where we're really seeing the performance and that's what supports it.
So your point is correct.
But then there have also other patterns that have given us encouragement and support as well.
So.
I guess I think it's the big point there Joe is that anything we've seen on the production from the A the C or the Codell hasn't detracted from our original expectations of the B pattern we've looked at there.
Okay.
And just one last question.
Any progress made on determining LNG scope or development plans offshore -- Israel onshore versus floating LNG or still more to come on that? We're working in parallel both options both floating as well as onshore as of course we're also looking at Cyprus as well.
So that work from an engineering standpoint is moving forward.
The key will be in Israel hopefully obtaining a final policy decision by the government shortly.
We do believe that it is pending on the export policy and that will help us move some of those projects forward.
But we're keeping every option open right now.
There's a lot of possibilities there.
We'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons &amp; Company.
Research Division</strong> Real quickly maybe tying a bunch of these Niobrara questions together.
I believe in December you talked about a net resource of about 2.1 billion barrels.
Obviously we didn't have a lot of the results that you've come up with subsequently.
Where do we stand now in terms of thinking about net resource potential out of the Niobrara and that general area Eastern Colorado et cetera? Well I'd say David it's fair to say we believe it'll increase.
Just from all the things we've described.
But I'd say we're probably not ready to just focus on a particular number yet.
We've still got a lot of drilling a lot of wells to complete and a lot more production history on some of these different patterns we're testing.
And I would imagine we want to get that information in get some extended production history and then revisit that number toward the end of the year.
Yes.
We've -- and believe me we ask that question all the time.
But yes our history has been -- is to base our resource estimates on solid results and we don't speculate on where it's going.
So this is what we're doing right now is we're gathering all the data from these compressed patterns increased density drilling looking at it through the various areas and that's allowing the teams to start working on improved resource estimates.
There's no doubt directionally where it's going because you've heard what the basis was on our prior estimates and what we're thinking now.
But it's understanding how that applies in the various areas and making sure we got good solid estimates on recoveries.
That's all part of the process.
So sorry for the dodge on that but we're still getting the answer ourself.
Research Division</strong> No problem I completely understood.
Maybe switching over to the Marcellus just for a second.
As you highlighted perhaps as early as 3Q your partner could decide to push the drill bit a little harder in the dry gas window.
Just trying to think about it from a cash flow impact in terms of potential uptick in CapEx versus rising gas prices and the potential impact in cash flow to you guys.
Should we just look at that as a wash and not be worried that any kind of upward movement in CapEx that previously was unplanned will be self funded by the gas additional benefit of higher gas prices across your gas production in North America? Yes Dave.
When you look at it as Chuck mentioned that there's a potential lift.
If price stayed up for the next 3 months let's say April and then the next 2 months above that $4 then the carry would kick in what July August type time frame.
But -- and then the actual impact of that carry kicking in offset by the additional revenue from the gas price above $4 versus below $4 that's pretty close to a wash when you look at that.
As far as the drilling part additional drilling and the discussions we've had with our partner and actually when you think about the realistic time frame it would take to ramp up a program again I don't see a big increase this year in gas drilling.
I think that discussion will really be as we start to look at how we lay the plans out for next year and how consistent in the outlook for gas price is.
I think also our -- while the industry has experienced a little bit of an uptick in gas prices we still see in our program that there's -- our oil projects have much superior economics.
And so there's not a desire on our part to ramp up dry gas drilling.
Now we'll work with our partner on the 2014 budget and we'll work through that.
But this is not a time to get in my view to get overly optimistic.
It's a time to enjoy the fact that we've had a nice increase in gas prices and we need to stick with our plan and that's what we're doing this year is staying with our plans.
We'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Dave I was wondering if you could maybe comment a little bit more on some of the well results you saw in the A and C Bench as well as the Codell? And maybe I don't know if you could walk us through how these compare.
I think in the oil window you've talked about a 335 MMBoe type of EUR.
Are you seeing well results in any of the benches similar to what you've seen in the B? I think we are in cases and it varies and it varies with the geology out there in the different patterns.
I'd say each pattern and it's -- I'll couch this with but it's still very early.
As Chuck mentioned we like to get some extended production data.
But from what we've seen in the first 90 days or so each pattern looks economic.
And one of the things we've really kept a close eye on is just how does any one interval's performance affect the B interval and compare to the B.
So we've been very pleased with what we've seen there and so we're going to do a lot more of this type testing as part of the drilling program this year.
Research Division</strong> Fair enough.
It sounds like 16 wells per pad has got money in the bank with upside here.
The second question Chuck is you guys have talked about a 9 500 kind of well inventory for the horizontal program clearly upside to that number.
How do you accelerate -- how does that come into your plans to accelerate activity even more? I know you plan to drill 500 wells in 2016 but based on these initial positive well results from wells 24 do we even go even faster than that pace Chuck? No they don't want to answer my phone calls.
So all I could say is we looked at -- we have been on a pace of growing this program.
When we looked at our prior 5-year plan versus the 5-year plan that you just mentioned that we put out last December that had added 1 100 wells over that 5-year period and so that was a tremendous growth rate there.
So it's all about making sure that we understand what the optimum development because you don't want to race in in an area and prematurely develop it in a way that's not optimal.
That's what we're trying to do here.
But as soon as we see where there's -- we're getting -- continuing to get more and more clarity on how to move forward.
Yes the idea is to grow the production.
Kind of my constant speech is that 9 000 drilling opportunities is nice.
But if some of them are 20 and 30 years out it doesn't add value.
So we've got to move that forward but we have to do it in a very deliberate fashion.
So it's all about continuing to press forward making sure that we're working everything all the pieces of this not just the fact that we've got locations but this is a huge business.
This is a big manufacturing business.
So we've got to work all those supply chain logistics that go along with it.
But that's what we're doing because we know it's going to create value to accelerate it even more.
Well and part of the thinking there too as we're going forward is you're evolving more and more to more pad drilling.
And then the more wells that you can actually put on these pads as you go to a larger density of wells per section I think optimally it will continue to evolve into an increased activity rate at some point.
Research Division</strong> Final question Chuck can you just give us an update on where you stand in terms of trying to close the Woodside transaction? Well the -- I mean we -- all the parties are committed to close it.
But quite honestly with so much of that transaction focused on Leviathan and potential and export project down the road that we're really at this point waiting on the government to issue its export policy.
And again we've gotten certainly the recent trip that I was over there.
I got a lot of comfort that that was a high priority with the new government in Israel.
So that's a key piece.
That's a key part of it.
And certainly our structure that we announced as part of that is tied to an export policy.
So I think both the Woodside CEO and myself have made comments that it's important that the government make some decisions so that we can move on and because we really can't make good decisions on how to develop Leviathan without having fully defined what the rules will be for export.
I'm comfort -- I'm confident that they will issue those but that's what is really key to getting everything closed.
We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Back to DJ Basin.
Can you just talk to the cost trends that you're seeing on a per well basis and then relative to lateral length.
I think the costs are staying fairly constant right now Brian.
I'd say they've kind of leveled off as we've talked actually come down a little bit over the last year as we've started to get more in the development phase on a lot of these areas but they've somewhat leveled off.
You're still in that range plus or minus 4.5 million for that 4 000-foot type lateral.
And then you're up closer to 7 500 and 8 000 for the 9 000 footers.
But you see increased efficiency when you look at the increased lateral links on a kind of an F&amp;D per well if you will as you move from the 4 to the 7 to the 9.
So that's part of the economic improvement that you see us to continue to be able to step out lateral lengths.
Research Division</strong> Great.
Are you seeing any service cost pressures there? It seems there's more companies talking and trying potentially accelerating activity around based in part on your success.
Haven't really seen it yet.
I mean as we get into the third quarter and get in more discussions on next year pricing and so forth we'll see where the industry's at and where the activity is.
But I haven't picked up anything on increasing pressure on the cost side over there right now.
Research Division</strong> And lastly for the second quarter in Israel what should our gas price expectations or what do you expect in terms of gas price expectations for production -- or gas production expectations and do you see the constraints to your production demand ahead of summer or do you see the constraints being the ramp up of capacity at Tamar? Well I think on pricing when we laid out our guidance for that that's the best place to go on that because it is -- that's a blend of -- we'll have a blend of Mari-B that satisfies some old contracts on the Tamar.
So I wouldn't -- so it's just a little north of $5 and so I wouldn't deviate from that.
I think on the production side of it I mean second quarter is a -- I mean we rolled it into the guidance and it tends to be a shoulder month for Israel and we're kind of making a guess on what the demand will be.
Yes I mean when you think about it second quarter's going to bounce between that 600 to 700 gross type numbers Scott and what we're expecting right now.
And then third quarter as we've mentioned we ought to start to see some periods where you get up in that 900 range depending on whether seasonal demands kick in.
We've actually if you go back a couple of years when Egypt was supplying gas we actually saw combined with those imports plus our own deliveries we were seeing production in one third quarter of 800-plus million of total country demand and that was a couple of years ago.
So we know the demand is there.
Guessing weather is just like guessing weather here in the U.S.
So I think right now we've got delivery capacity and we'll see what the demand is.
Research Division</strong> That's great.
The demand is in a constraint in the second quarter you're fully ramped up in terms of Tamar and second quarter to meet whatever demand there may be? As we say we test the facility over 900 million.
So it's just a matter of what the demand is.
We are all set to deliver whatever they need right now.
We'll take our final question from Irene Hoff [ph] with Wunderlich Securities.
My question has to do with your extended lateral curve.
Can you explain to me why you have a little plateau there on the 1 million-barrel type curve? Are those later wells that you do something different? Are there Artificial Lift involved? Just kind of curious as to why it kind of normally go from hyperbolic to now you have low plateau which is fantastic for cash flow.
So little color please.
Okay.
You're talking about the initial period or the early stage period I think where yes it kind of ramps up.
And then what we saw is that actually leveled off a little bit for that 30- to 90-day or 30 almost up to 120-day period.
And that just seems to be the way these long laterals are performing where now as you get further away from the vertical part of the wellbore you get less drawdown.
And it's almost like you've got a gravity feed into there from this long period for some period of time but it just kind of replenishes itself is just what it appears to be doing on these longer laterals until you start to get a little bit of a decline in there.
But overall that's one of the things that really caught our eye when we're starting to see some of the performance of these that's how well these held up for an extended period of time especially early here.
And part of that is just bringing these things on pretty slow you see that initial ramp up first 0 to 30 to 45 days.
We're not pulling on these very hard.
We're trying to let them come on naturally and then just feed into the system And should that be the kind of curve that we would expect as you get more like 300-day data on these extended laterals? I don't know.
That's what we want to see is how this thing duplicates itself or repeats itself as we get a much wider database here to look at but we'd like to see that.
That's for sure.
That does conclude the today's question-and-answer session.
At this time I will turn the conference back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Thanks again for everybody participating in the call today as well as your interest in Noble Energy.
Just have a good day.
That does conclude today's presentation.
Thank you for your participation.
