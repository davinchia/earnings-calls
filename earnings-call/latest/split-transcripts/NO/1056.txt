Welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr.
David Larson.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you.
Good morning everyone.
Welcome to Noble Energy's third quarter 2014 earnings call and webcast.
This morning we issued our quarterly earnings release which hopefully you have had a chance to review.
A few supplemental slides for this call were also posted to our website and they will be good reference material for the discussion today.
Following remarks by Chuck Davidson and Dave Stover we will open the call for Q&amp;A and with the executive team.
We would ask that all participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up.
Finally I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements as well as references to non-GAAP financial measures.
You should read our disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those.
With that let me turn the call over to Chuck.
Thanks David.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us.
My opening comments are going to be brief today.
Our leadership transition that we announced last April remains on schedule with the announcement this past week of the election of Dave as our new CEO.
Dave will be an excellent CEO for Noble Energy and is perfect to lead the Company through its next phase of growth.
He's been an integral part of our success to this stage and has all the skills as well as an outstanding leadership team to support him as we move forward.
I'll continue as Chairman until next May when I will be retiring from Noble Energy.
My job between now and then is to work closely with Dave and the executive team to make sure that this transition continues to unfold smoothly and seamlessly and I have all the confidence that it will.
I do want to take a step back for a moment and share my thoughts on where I believe Noble Energy is today and where we are headed.
Noble is a Company that is built for the long-term.
We have said that many times in the past.
We've established ourselves as a diversified exploration and production Company that excels in onshore unconventional development as well as offshore exploration.
In the U.S.
we have core positions in two of the premier unconventional oil and gas plays which are delivering value for our Company and its shareholders.
Offshore we have three core areas which provided meaningful volume and cash flow growth through exploration success and project execution.
In addition weâ€™ve a material exploration program in front of us which will provide running room for the future.
Our diversified portfolio of assets is designed to deliver value in a variety of operating environments.
As we've said before we are not a single play Company nor are we limited to a single commodity market.
We have a portfolio of opportunities around the world that is well-balanced between liquids as well as both domestic and international national gas which gives us choices to effectively allocate capital and create value.
This portfolio results in a very unique multi-year profile for a Company.
It's why I believe that Noble Energy is well-positioned to deliver positive differential performance over the coming years.
So with that quick introduction let me turn the call over to Dave and the team.
Thanks Chuck.
I appreciate those nice comments and before I launch into the quarter let me make a few comments of my own.
The time goes by so fast that it is hard to believe I worked with Chuck for about 25 years now from ARCO to Vastar to Noble.
One of the things I admire about Chuck is his ability to handle adversity and always be thinking of long-term implication.
It is a testament to him that these traits have become part of the DNA of Noble Energy.
I've been at Noble now for close to 12 years and it's been amazing to be part of the transformation of this Company and I truly believe the best is yet to come.
When I think about doubling our volume in four of our five core areas in the next few years and at the same time having an exploration program focused on delivering a new core area Noble is well-positioned for the future.
Another of Chuck's strengths is his focus on succession planning and I owe him a great deal of gratitude for mentoring me all these years.
I believe we have a leadership team that provides a competitive advantage for years to come.
We mentioned some of the additional adjustments in our press release last week and I'm pleased with the operations leadership that we've built.
Some of them are here with me today Gary Willingham Susan Cunningham and Keith Elliott.
Now to talk about the quarter I plan to keep my prepared remarks a bit shorter than in the past since we have expanded the operations section of the release with more highlights and details.
I'm sure David would appreciate your feedback on this change.
It was another exciting quarter here at Noble energy.
Sales volumes for the quarter were above the mid-point of guidance driven by record sales in three of our five core areas including the DJ Basin Marcellus and Eastern Mediterranean.
Our U.S.
onshore assets continued to deliver outstanding results as our understanding of the DJ Basin and Marcellus grows.
Our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico remain on track to deliver significant growth beginning in 2015.
And in the Eastern Mediterranean our teams continue to make progress capturing more gas markets as the regional demand for our natural gas continues to grow.
It's definitely been a busy quarter for Noble Energy.
Let's talk about our core areas.
Starting with the U.S.
onshore we delivered record production in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus on the back of some strong execution of our horizontal programs.
As you can see on slide 4 the horizontal programs have outstanding growth over the last year up 50% over the equivalent period a year ago when adjusted for asset sales.
During the third quarter we brought online 123 wells.
We expect to bring on an additional 172 wells horizontal wells during the fourth quarter putting us on track to meet our planned year-end exit rate.
In fact we have already brought online more than one-third of the planned fourth-quarter wells this month alone and are currently producing 145 000 barrels of oil equivalent from the horizontal program in the U.S.
onshore.
In the DJ Basin production was up 15% from the third quarter last year.
Our volume was reduced by a few thousand barrels per day as a result of facility downtime some of which was mentioned in last quarter's call.
We continue to work closely with our midstream partner to increase capacity and improve reliability.
Recently new compression and dehydration capacity has been added which has contributed to new system throughput records and several other incremental projects are expected to start up in the coming months.
We feel good about where third-party infrastructure is heading and its ability to keep up with our activity levels.
We continue to focus on improving well performance in three ways.
The first is through extended laterals where we are clearly seeing better investment efficiency.
In the quarter 30% of the wells drilled were combination of mid and long laterals.
Another focus is increased density.
We have highlighted on slide 5 the initial results of our down spacing test in section 30 of the Wells Ranch IDP results from this test are very encouraging and while early the wells are performing at or above the type curve.
We have additional down spacing tests coming online in other areas during the fourth quarter.
The third focus for improved well performance is enhanced completion techniques.
We are also seeing encouraging results in this area.
Our initial Plug-n-Perf completions at the Peaks/Peppler pad in the core IDP continue to out-perform the type curve after five months of production.
Late in the quarter we brought online an additional four wells utilizing Plug-n-Perf completion design and we plan to bring online an additional 20 Plug-n-Perf completions by the end of 2014.
Ultimately we have a huge platform of resources to work from as we continue to improve investment efficiency and ultimate recovery.
We're making progress on a number of our Noble operated infrastructure products that will enable us to meet our long-term growth productions.
We recently expanded the oil infrastructure at the Wells Ranch Central Processing Facility.
This facility is tied in to the DCP Rocky Compressor station which is expected to come online in the first half of 2015 with a capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day and in the northern Colorado area the Keota gas plant remains on schedule to start up in the fourth quarter with an initial capacity of 15 million cubic feet per day.
Plans are then to double its capacity in the first quarter of 2015.
This facility will provide significant incremental capacity in the liquid rich area of East Pony.
The story in the Marcellus is very similar to the DJ Basin and it starts with a great execution and includes improving well performance enhanced completions and down spacing.
In the quarter production was up an impressive 31% over the previous quarter and the liquids component has now increased to 13% of this area's production.
During the quarter we had some very encouraging results delineating a new area in West Virginia.
We began flowing back wells from the Oxford number Oxford-1 and Shirley-1 pads and the Oxford-Pennsboro-Shirley area and you can see their performance on slide 6.
These are the first two pads online in the area and the initial performance is above type curve.
The Oxford pad is our first 550-foot down spacing test in the area and we are encouraged by the high initial liquids contribution.
The next pad coming online in this area is Missouri is the Pennsboro-1 in the fourth quarter.
We continue to manage our portfolio of assets and look for opportunities to bring value forward.
During the quarter we successfully completed the CONE Midstream MLP Initial Public Offering which generated over $200 million in net proceeds to Noble Energy.
In fact CONE's current market capitalization stands at $1.7 billion of which our share is $550 million.
The proceeds from this transaction along with our non-core assets divestment program have contributed to our strong balance sheet as we continue to invest in our major products and onshore horizontal development programs.
So as we look toward fourth quarter and the significant growth ahead for the U.S.
onshore area we are confident that we're in a position to deliver and enter 2015 in great shape.
Let's move onto the Gulf of Mexico an area that is a bit underappreciated in our portfolio today.
Over the last year we have had tremendous performance from our legacy fields maintaining flat production levels with active reservoir and well management plans.
Of specific note the Galapagos field continues to outperform expectations averaging 9000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net in the quarter.
Cumulative gross production from Galapagos has reached 36 million barrels of oil equivalent in just 25 months.
The result is more than two times payout of the investment in two years with the strong current production and up hole zones still to be produced.
Earlier in the quarter we announced final well results at the Katmai discovery and Dantzler appraisal well.
Katmai represents our fifth operated Gulf of Mexico discovery in a row and provides another meaningful project to our lineup of Gulf of Mexico developments.
With the appraisal success at the Dantzler providing an increase in resource size and the development work being done at Big Bend the Rio Grande development will lead a sizable oil volume increase from the Gulf of Mexico over the next couple of years.
We're looking forward to the near-term impact from our Gulf of Mexico developments.
All major contracts have been awarded and offshore facility modifications have commenced for all ongoing projects.
The project line-up can be seen on slide 7.
First production is only about a year away for Big Bend.
The initial net production rate from each field is expected to be in excess of 10 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with over 80% oil.
By designing Big Bend infrastructure carefully we were able to make Dantzler part of that development and accelerate first production to the first quarter of 2016.
On the exploration front we expect to spud the Madison well any day now which is an acceleration of our original plans.
Madison is another meaningful exploration test in the Miocene trend where we have a proven track record of success.
The well is located near the Galapagos field and if successful will be a tie-back to a nearby facility results from the well are expected early 2015.
Internationally our assets in West Africa continued to perform extremely well.
The decline rates at our fields in Equatorial Guinea have lower than expected as a result of strong reservoir performance and production management.
I'm particularly pleased with how the teams are managing these liquid rich assets which provide significant cash flow for the business.
Looking ahead we will be resuming exploration drilling in West Africa with the Cheetah prospect offshore Cameroon in 2015.
We recently added Woodside to our partnership for this well.
In the Eastern Mediterranean over the course of the last six months we have executed letters of intent for regional gross daily volumes of over 1.5 billion cubic feet per day and total volumes of over 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to these customers.
These agreements highlight the long-term demand for Tamar and Leviathan gas and all parties are focused on completing them as soon as possible.
We've shown on slide 9 our expected regional sales for Tamar and Leviathan which includes an LOI for interruptible sales from Tamar to Egyptian domestic customers.
We anticipate we could be in position to provide around 200 million cubic feet per day at off-peak hours to Egypt as soon as regulatory approvals are received.
The compression project at the Ashdod onshore receiving terminal which handles gas for Tamar remains on schedule to be complete by next summer.
Once complete peak capacity at Tamar will be 1.2 billion cubic feet per day.
This is part of a multi-year expansion at Tamar which will increase capacity to 2 billion cubic feet per day by 2017 to meet growing demand in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter slide 10 highlights our anticipated production growth.
We expected to bring on a record number of horizontal wells in our U.S.
onshore program which underpins our production ramp.
Natural gas demand in Israel is normally lighter in the fourth quarter.
Our sales volume range for the quarter is 307 000 to 327 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day consistent with earlier guidance but adjusted for the non-core divestiture recently competed in the Piceance Basin.
It is worth noting that our fourth-quarter oil volumes are expected to be 36% of the mix up 3% from the 33% in the third quarter.
This is driven by West Africa and DJ volumes.
We look forward to a strong close to 2014 setting us up well for 2015.
While it is too early for details we plan to remain flexible with our 2015 capital program as we monitor the commodity outlook for oil and domestic natural gas.
Our diverse portfolio of oil domestic and international gas combined with a strong balance sheet provides us options to continue to build value in a variety of operating environments.
With that Cassandra we would like to go ahead and open the call for questions.
The first question following up on your last comment on 2014 CapEx I know what your investor presentation in December at several slides that describe your risk management and those potentially relevant for today was cash flow at risk slides and in the slide you tested it down (indiscernible) for all '14 and '16 at $75 GI 320 and I think it was a $5 (indiscernible) and that was $2.5 billion cash flow swing and you stated there was a minimum risk of breaching your key debt metrics and so I know youâ€™ve a significant liquid hedge and liquidity to maybe just kind of thinking back to that slide can I conclude how Noble would operate in a $75 WTI environment or maybe explain how you think about that liquidity and willingness to draw on that liquidity to deliver the five-year and longer term growth plan.
I think Evan as Iâ€™ve mentioned it's little too early to get into exactly what we'll do next year.
We're going to look at different sensitivities to commodity price obviously versus where that now both down and up on that and we will continue to do that cash flow at risk analysis as we've always done.
I think when you look at our program for next year the main levers are the major -- when you look at the capital portion the major project timing on that exploration program size and pace of the onshore development.
I think as you mentioned we also have a nice hedge book for next year that kind of minimizes some of that impact on pricing swing.
So we'll continue to look at all of that.
Okay.
Maybe a different CapEx question that relates to your recent and successful CONE IPO.
I know you put forth different pie charts on facilities CapEx with a pretty big wedge in that $3.3 billion U.S.
onshore 2014 CapEx but how much of that or what did you spend this year? I mean Marcellus facilities CapEx given the CONE vehicle now gives you an ability to convert that CapEx investment to get back into cash at a reasonable timeframe.
I don't have the number with me right now but it -- what you've seen in both the Marcellus and the DJ has been kind of increasing facility spend as we've gotten further down the road on some of these facilities.
I mean in the DJ we have talked about the integrated development plans up there and in the Marcellus we're actually adapting some of that thought process into the Marcellus.
So youâ€™ve seen an increase on both of those and obviously that led into the Marcellus to a CONE IPO which was very advantageous and highlighted some value in that area.
So I think you'll continue to see some facilities spend increase but I don't have the exact numbers with me here.
But it will continue to ramp up in both areas over time as both areas continue to grow.
And just one other follow-up just to that -- given the success there and it is still more recent -- does it change your thoughts of potentially using that structure to monetize or to better capitalize infrastructure spending in other parts of your U.S.
onshore or actually offshore (indiscernible) it will be onshore.
To your point we've additional infrastructure coming on offshore too with big major projects.
But we will continue to look at as I mentioned in my notes that helped unlock value in the Marcellus we will continue to look at in the other parts of our business as the facility spend continues to grow and become a bigger part of the business.
I've two questions also if I may Chuck it's kind of a follow-up to Evans CapEx question.
There is a chatter around breakeven of shale economics in the U.S.
I'm just curious as to how if you could share your perspective on your portfolio.
In other words is there a level or recourse to a level where you would consider at least a mid to high grade your capital allocation I guess in the DJ in particular and Iâ€™ve got a follow-up.
I was trying to get your perspective on how you see the (indiscernible) breaking even for U.S.
unconventional production really specifically to your portfolio and whether there is a level that you would consider that you need to hydrate your capital allocation within the DJ particular.
I'm going to let Dave carry on with that but I'll just continue with the theme that Iâ€™ve had before is that in many instances in the unconventional it's not so much the breakeven economics it's managing your cash flow and your balance sheet.
And I think that's where for many producers we will see as they look at a particular commodity environment.
We've seen this cycle on natural gas several times the past couple years.
Oil we've seen the cycle as well and I think it's a matter of managing cash flow and in some of these unconventional plays have very strong economics even at lower oil prices but you want to manage your balance sheet.
And I'll leave it to Dave to comment on Noble's portfolio and how he looks at it.
I think it was designed this way but we're set up to be in two of the best unconventional plays in the U.S.
and I think that's borne out when you look at a lot of the analysis of breakeven economics that various folks do on these plays and especially in the DJ it looks very good against that.
Obviously there is different portions of it that have different economics as you have different oil and gas mix across the play but we're very comfortable and very pleased that we've got the portfolio we have whether it's our onshore portfolio or the other components of our core areas.
I mean thatâ€™s the whole basis for that diversified portfolio but it starts with high quality assets in each of the core areas.
My follow-up is really in the longer term production outlook.
I realize that the commodity outlook is clearly challenging a lot of folk's expectations I guess but as you pointed out Dave you have a lot of bouncing your portfolio specific to the Mediterranean and since you give us the update in December you have clearly had substantial progress in contracting Leviathan on gas in particular.
So I'm just wondering if you could give us an idea how does the event of last several months in terms of Leviathan change your production expectations your development expectations and if I may but what headroom do youâ€™ve left to max out I guess you're getting pretty close on your export alone and (indiscernible) whether there is any effects of that.
I'll leave it at that.
Let me start on that and Keith can talk a little more about where weâ€™re on the whole Leviathan marketing.
But when you think about the biggest difference is when you look at the end of that five year outlook and into the 10 year outlook kind of that 2018 and beyond period we're now looking at volumes from Leviathan potentially they are significantly higher than what we talked about a year or so ago.
We originally were talking about an initial Phase 1 of Leviathan that was about $800 million a day and now we're planning for something that has the capacity of 1.6 bcf a day with the plans to operate kind of on average up to 1.2 bcf a day and that's kind of what a lot of the contracting and LIIs [ph] and what we're moving on additional volumes but again that's just the first phase of Leviathan.
There is still a big component of Leviathan that won't be marketed in that first phase part of it held for domestic but there is still additional export volumes also.
So Keith may just update you a little bit on where weâ€™re in our thinking there.
Thanks Dave.
Yes I think that's exactly right Doug.
When you look at the LOIs that we have in place on Leviathan and just now weâ€™re moving to -- well it's about 5.5 tcf that are in total under LOI which represents a little over half of the exportable allocation from Leviathan-based on the most between '13 export policy.
So we still have ways to go and we still have -- the good thing is we continue to see growing demand in the region and we also see the growing opportunity for even extra regional export there.
So we're very encouraged by what we've seen in the marketing activities in the region.
The other thing I would add Doug is not just Leviathan it's Tamar also.
We don't have this LOI with Union Fenosa which is substantial volume of gas.
I think it's about over 400 million a day and close to 2.5 tcf and that's somewhat additive to what we were originally thinking about a year and year and half ag.
Again it's kind of in that same timeframe late '17 and getting full impact but in the '18 and beyond.
So thatâ€™s been the biggest difference it's not just the clarity of the delivery of the overall five year plan but it's more clarity around what a 10 year plan looks like.
Just a clarification so it's the resource at Leviathan expanded with export ceiling expand also? Yes.
The export policy is written such that it's a percentage of overall total resource and the percentages vary by size of field but in scope of Leviathan it's roughly 50%.
Just hoping to kind of ask a few follow-ups here on Israel you guys have any sort of better clarity on when you think you might be able to sanction Leviathan project.
Additionally can you just give us your current thinking around the potential for LNG in the Eastern Mediterranean I guess just finally with respect to Israel is there any update on when you may spud your deep oil prospect below the Leviathan field? On the Leviathan sanction I think we're still progressing towards the sanction but a number of things to fall into place those are the things that we're working on right now.
The contracts taking these big contracts from an LOI to a GSPA whether it's the contract with Jordan whether it's the contract with BG.
Those will be key items and then on the back of that then getting the regulatory where it's export approval agreement with what we've signed up for between the different countries but I think the thing that we're seeing is a lot of support for all of this by the timing of it's all got to come together.
So that would be into -- most likely into next year sometime with the first piece of that being -- moving the LOI to actual gas sales agreements.
I think on -- which kind of then leads to the next second phase which is your question on the LNG piece.
I think that gets into what is the best way to handle the second phase of marketing here.
Part of that will be dependent on what we see for additional opportunities and regional but part of it will also be tied to how much do we want to play on a world market and I think when you're looking at LNG for the Israeli gas it's probably the most likely scenario on LNG would be an FLNG type project so we keep that alive.
We keep that option alive and we will continue to keep that option alive as we continue to see how much the regional market continues to grow.
And we've not by any stretch of the imagination captured all of the regional market with Phase 1 on this.
I think on the deep oil part of this I mean we're still excited about deep oil propsectivity over there but the timing is going to be dependent on when we bring our rig capable of drilling the deep oil prospect into to go along with the additional Leviathan and Tamar development and then in what sequence we do those things.
So that all have to fit together.
Can you just give us a little bit more on Nevada? You talked about commencing production in July.
I just want to see how many wells would that be? And it looks like you're adding three increments wells to the budget here in the second half just trying to get a sense of those horizontal wells just maybe some more color on Nevada will be helpful.
I mean thatâ€™s still a big opportunity for us.
I will let Gary talk just a little bit about what weâ€™re doing currently and Susan may expand a little bit about her thoughts going forward as she is getting more involved in this now to from the frontier new venture aspect of this actually trying to turn this into a new core area.
So we have had one vertical well thatâ€™s been producing since July initially came on at fairly high rate declined off fairly steeply and has been producing around 10 to 15 barrels a day for a while now fairly flat.
We've moved the rate recently back to Nevada recently TD our third well in the southern prospect area the Huntington prospect area and are now in the process of moving the rig to the northern prospect area Mary's River where we'll drill our first test up there.
So we're encouraged by what we saw in the well in Huntington on the logs a little bit thicker section than we saw in the middle prospect area where the first producing well is and we expect to start completion operations on that new well in the next 4 to 6 weeks probably.
We do have three wells that we talked about that's not a change to the plan that's been the plan all along and at least these first two again are vertical wells.
We are evaluating the potential maybe of drilling a horizontal well in the future but that still remains to be seen.
On your Plug-n-Perf completions how much outperformance are you seeing after 150 days from those first two wells in the core? I know the EUR [ph] youâ€™re looking at on average there is 480 000 boe so what are these wells looking like and then could you talk about the implications of transitioning to Plug-n-Perf across the entire program if you're thinking about that and also what other completion design changes are you testing? I mean in one of the things we're excited about is continuing to look at the opportunities here for tweaking if you will the completion especially as we move to more down spacing activity.
I will let Gary kind of tell you a little bit about what they are doing and what they have gotten in front of them there.
Yes Joe those first two wells that we announced a while back are still performing strongly as you mentioned.
I don't have the plots right in front of me but I think they are outperforming the sliding sleeve probably that 25% to 30% range.
Weâ€™re very excited about that we do have plans to do quite a few more of those.
Weâ€™ve recently completed four more they are not online yet.
They will be coming on in 4Q and then we have plans for another 20 or so beyond that still for the rest of the year.
And we'll see where we go from there.
Certainly the early days are encouraging.
We think they provide a lot of benefits over the sliding sleeve and a number of ways so weâ€™re going to continue to test those.
The cost is about 400 000 more per well so we want to get comfortable that the economics are there for that incremental recovery but it sure looks encouraging to-date.
As far as other completion things we're trying not to get into a lot of details but we're testing other fluids weâ€™re testing other sand concentrations perf strategies.
So a number of things we're trying and we had mentioned prior our second underground laboratory in the Wells Ranch area we tried a number of different things in the area and we're starting to get quite a bit of data coming in from those.
So we will probably have more to talk about on the 4Q call from that.
In terms of down spacing and will play to declare victory with down spacing using 32 wells per section at Wells Ranch and elsewhere and could you discover basically what you've done so far in terms of down spacing.
Are you doing it in the Niobrara C or the A or the Codell can you describe that.
And then should we assume some degradation when you go down to 32 wells per section even if youâ€™re not seeing much right now.
Yes Joel I think it's still pretty early on a lot of those questions.
The pad that we've released this quarter the Wells Ranch it's a combination of Niobrara A B and C and you can see that the 32 well per section wells are performing right in line with the 16.
So obviously very encouraged by that I think it's going to be a case-by-case basis across the basin.
It's way too early to declare victory and certainly declare victory based on wide but we've got quite a bit of down spacing still to come on this year of the wells that are still coming on in the DJ this year roughly half of those are down spacing wells either 24s or 32.
So we'll get those online we will see how they perform relative to not only the tight curve but the normal spacing wells in those areas and pass judgment for that.
If I could go ask some questions about the Marcellus was at I believe has been touched on it.
Those two pad that you had in Tyler and beverage County looks really strong and I know you said they were as good as some of your the best wells you had in majors ago but can you talk about how those wells perform versus your expectations predrilled and perhaps what the factors were that are contributing deleting to have they are performing whether that be the completion design I think you mentioned reduced stage of cluster spacing or perhaps the rock properties or whatever else may be at play there.
Right.
I think if you look at the slide and see relevant to the type curve how well they've done which the type curve is usually more of a predrilled type estimate.
The other thing we have commented on the slide we have a little higher liquids content at least starting out.
So both of those have been positives but I'll let Gary expand a little bit on what he is seeing in there.
Charles very excited about the area.
As we have said these two pads are the first two pads in the area and definitely outperforming our predrilled expectations which are the type curves that are shown on the chart.
Just as excited that they are performing very similarly to each other.
So we do see some consistency across the area already in performance and as we mentioned they are performing every bit as good or better than our best pad ever back in major.
So all very exciting.
We are doing some different completion design tests down there as well including the reduced stage and cluster spacing and then as we mentioned earlier we've also got down spacing testing going at Oxford those are 550 foot spaced laterals and so to see this level of performance on a down spaced wells in a new area obviously very excited about that.
And looking forward to the next pad that comes on in that area which is the (indiscernible) pad coming on in 4Q.
I guess it wasn't clear on whether that type curve applied to these areas.
But thanks for that clarification.
That is specific to this area.
And Dave if I could go back to a point you are making earlier into Q&amp;A when you mentioned the three levers that you have for 2015 CapEx I believe you said it was major project timing.
The exploration program and then the pace of the onshore unconventional development.
The way I understand you guys is all three of those are going to remain important to you in any commodity price environment.
Can you talk about how those what the sequence of ratcheting it down and back up might be whether if the commodity prices go down from here or whether -- or if they were two back up from here is there a sequence the going.
I think you have to look at all of it.
If you to look at the whole portfolio.
It starts with where are you on the timing of the development where are we on sanctioning timing of the big Eastern-Med projects.
How the timeframe that to the gas contracts come into place the government approvals and that's kind of your first big piece that you're keeping an eye on.
And the rest of it's all -- you have options on how you look at both the pace of onshore and the size of the exploration program.
But as you said they're all important.
They are all significant contributors to us and we'll look at it from a whole portfolio of the whole team will continue to look at it but the nice part is you continue to have more things out there to do then we'll spend money on.
It continues to high grade the portfolio at no matter what the price environment wherein.
Right.
That's better than the other -- than the alternative I suppose.
And are you on your regular capital budgeting timeframe this year? So we should expect something may be December January? We are.
As we've been talking about it's not the year to accelerate the timing of that given everything out there but this is our normal course that we look back we've usually put out something by the late January timeframe at least.
At the risk of hammering the point if I could just carry on asking about the sensitivity to your price environment.
You mentioned that you would be managing towards balance sheet could you just remind us what the parameters are what the ratios are that we should look at and what your tolerances on the specs [ph]? We laid out in the Analyst Day last year that we will continue to maintain strong liquidity level and that we would keep our work to keep our rating as it is.
And we didn't give any specific targets around debt levels but we did show a forward projection kind of a range so I think thatâ€™s an appropriate way to think about it.
We continue to think BBB is a good place to be and we work to keep it there.
Right and then the outlook given there would imply obviously that you would stay at BBB within that range? Yes.
And then I think the other thing is building on the point is we have a very deep portfolio with a lot of investment flexibility and then we have -- weâ€™re well hedged probably differentially hedged for 2015 versus the competition at prices that are now well above the strip.
So that sets us up well going into next year.
And then if I could just clarify I know youâ€™re speaking of the costs but did I hear right to an early question that you are saying that this is sort of a priority list we should be number one major projects number two exploration and number three onshore activity would be the set of stuff that would look at or is that a misinterpretation.
I wouldn't interpreted that there is a priority where we're going in any particular order there.
The comment was around that those are the three things that make up the levers that we have on capital adjustment or flexibility if you will as Ken put it.
And the piece that we will continue to watch first is the timing of how these major projects that haven't started up how they come together.
But that's not a priority order of preference of where you put your money by any stretch of the imagination.
All three of those are strong attributes.
The question today has to do with the Marcellus.
The Marcellus has become quite a bit of your gas production so I'm looking at sort of price realization for both natural gas and NGL.
It seems to have declined during the third fourth quarter versus the first half.
So my question is this somewhat seasonal? Should we expect a little better price realization for gas during the fourth quarter same for NGL and then you actually talked about quite a bit on how you ship your gas out if you can give us a little bit more color on that and also some similarly what do you do with your NGL bucket where does it go right now? Is it mostly local? And sort of what kind of pricing you're getting for that?  Let me see if I can start on some of that Irene on the pricing realization I think first half of the year with a little bit stronger than second half.
As you started to see more volume in the basin and trying to get out of the basin.
I think fourth quarter and in the first quarter hope it will be a little better then that's as you start to see some more winter impact and you're starting to see some folks getting more of the products starting to move out of the basin.
I think what we've talked about is getting a larger and larger percentage out of the basin over time.
I think we've got about 30% of our gas right now kicked out of the basin and we're in -- weâ€™re either in some arrangements or talking about some arrangements over the next few years to get a larger percentage even out of the basin which will help with pricing.
And I've seen those anywhere from $0.40 to $0.90 on different scenarios type of thing.
So that will continue to change as you go forward but I think directionally for everybody up there and just that part of the world that youâ€™re seeing a number of new pipes.
You're seeing some things looking at being reversed down to the Gulf coast.
You're seeing new pipes that go up to the Midwest some even up further Northeast some to the Southeast and some to the Gulf.
I don't know Gary anything else on that? No I think that pretty well covered it Dave I mean for us it's just diversity where the product can go.
So we highlighted in the press release a couple of new firm capacity deals that we've done all the areas that Dave just mentioned as well as the Great Lakes.
So when you look at our firm transport firm sales today weâ€™re sitting at about $350 million a day and by 2017 the end of 2017 we expect to be up over or right at 800 million cubic feet a day so that's a very well diversified portfolio of transport.
So how about a little color on your natural gas liquid.
Right now where do they end up? This is still mostly sort of in the middle of the continent and what pricing are you getting for those products? Well the NGL gets mainly handled through the processing facility there and where it ends up? I think it's a blend of pricing whether it's Mount Belvieu or others.
That you said blend of pricing obviously you saw a little more ethane in the mix in the last quarter so that had some impact on the overall pricing when you look at just percentage of pricing.
When we transition from the macro to some of the DJ specific stuff and you alluded to this a little bit but you talked about the frac and flow back procedures and some of the slides being different on the tighter spacing wells.
Can you give us more detail exactly what you're doing there?  Yes David not to get into a lot of details that we talked in the past about as we go to tighter and tighter spacing our goal obviously is to stimulate more of the rock volume near well bore.
So we've done a number of things to try and achieve that thatâ€™s to obviously reduce any potential impact of interference as we drill tighter and tighter and laterals but those things include many of the things that we have already talked about the Plug-n-Pref we have run some tests on sliding sleeves where we have continued to use sliding sleeves but with tighter stage spacing.
We've done some test where we changed the way in which we pick and space our perfs out along the laterals.
We've done a number of tests on different fluids and sand concentration.
So it's really a good combinations of things.
I mentioned we brought our second underground laboratory on recently and the DJ Basin in the Wells Ranch area.
Those underground laboratories are designed to gather data strategy throughout the lateral length of the wells of those fiber optics are in and the wells that we ran the fiber optics in we've actually done different completion technique tests along that lateral.
So for instance we may do three stages using one technique the next three using another technique and so on and with those of fiber optics down haul we can actually determine the performance difference between each of those techniques which allows us to further optimize as we go.
So probably a lot more to come on that on the year-end call.
Okay and can I just -- you talk about in the DJ longer laterals some operators have talked about difficulty in essentially drilling up the plugs once you get beyond some specified 7000 feet.
Are you guys seeing that in the once you've done or did you see that in the wells you have drilled longer laterals with the 8000 foot type wells or can you talk a little about that? Yes David I'm not really aware of any problem with -- any significant problems we have to-date.
Okay.
And last question on the DJ if I think about the vertical well production obviously horizontal is up 30% the vertical cause a little bit of your drag on your overall DJ number.
Is that a natural decline issue.
Is that a wells being shutting because of line pressures? I'm just trying to about how to think about that wedge of the production piece going forward.
Yes it's a combination of both the vertical are a lot more susceptible to height line pressures and third party downtime.
When you look at the roughly 3000 barrels a day impact that we had in 3Q from third party issues and higher line pressures about two thirds of that was actually on the vertical program.
They are just a lot more sensitive to those high line pressures not only in the moment in which they are flowing but if pressures get high enough that they're actually unable to flow then it takes a number of days for them to come back even once the line pressures drop.
So it's definitely a disproportionate impact on the vertical wells.
We have been doing a lot of work that only obvious with our midstream partner to alleviate the line pressure but on our own wells ourselves and optimizing how we are producing those to try and try and alleviate as much of that as we can but it is a greater impact.
Okay so with all the compression you talked about that you've added whatever DCP whatever midstream is doing out there we should see that start to moderate the steepness of that decline on the vertical? Is that fair? Yes certainly in everything that DCP is doing as well as what we're doing on our own pad facilities to reduce pressures and provide greater reliability of service is certainly going to help.
It's probably fair to say in the fourth quarter you got a sizable portion of your wells that aren't even tied to DCP infrastructure but they are in our own system right? Right.
When you look at the slide that shows the number of wells coming on in 4Q for that DJ number roughly a third of that is up in Northern Colorado.
So that's on our own system.
We've already got capacity up there through our own Lily Plant as well as some different third party arrangements and then we're bringing in our own (indiscernible) plan on in the fourth quarter and that will service those wells as well.
So a good chunk of the remaining well to be brought online are off of the traditional Greater Wattenberg DCP kind of system.
Just had a question that youâ€™ve have the plan of development submitted for Leviathan.
Can you update us on the expected gross investment and then timing of spending? I think timing of spending is obviously dependent on everything comes together for the sanctioning.
But I think you'll start to see a ramp up over the first year after timing and probably a majority of the spend and I'll let Keith follow-up on that prior end of the second year or so after sanctioning.
But plan of development was a big step to get through there and I'll let Keith kind of walk you through how he sees expenditures flowing from sanctioning.
So we'd expected to be ramping up from the point of sanction primarily the course of the development plan is now as you have heard at 1.6 bcf a day FPSO and that is the subject of a lot of front end work thatâ€™s continuing to go as we take the final investment decision on the project.
We would be committing to that and I think you'd see a ramp up peeking really in the 2016 and early 2017 timeframe.
And what was the gross investment expectation for this FPSO.
The gross investment for the total of Phase 1 is about $6.5 billion.
And there is additional investment -- that includes the investment in the Leviathan upstream development with all drilling and everything in.
There is an additional investment that would be in the form of export pipelines to the Egypt LNG plants and that's to the account though of the purchasers they will be laying that line to the FPSO.
And so as you think about from a year ago to now that's actually perfect segue.
How much was that investment in the export lines to Egypt and how much did that change the gross investment to get you to the 1.6 bcf a day.
I donâ€™t think when you looked at a year a year and half ago that we even had the scenario of an export line to Egypt as our base scenario and the whole development has changed over that period.
So you can't compare a cost of that versus what it was a year and a half ago.
So the whole development has changed the whole market has changed over there.
I mean just think about it from where we are now with about a bcf a day and by into 2018 between the combination of Tamar going up to 2 bcf a day and Leviathan at 1.6 bcf a day youâ€™re now looking at 3.6 bcf a day of capacity in that timeframe completely different than what we were looking at a while ago.
And before we were the first phase and the pieces we were looking at and talking was more focused around LNG projects.
And how to factor that into the equation.
So now we have the opportunity to maybe take advantage of existing LNG structures.
It seems that you're getting to a higher volume at a lower capital amount because you don't have the LNG in the plan at this point I was just trying to reconcile the Leviathan development before and that seems pretty clear.
That's exactly right.
I just wanted to ask you my first question on the Marcellus clearly a macro-environment where spare capacity is rising in the oil and gas market.
So I just wanted to see if you could comment how you're thinking about capital allocation to that Marcellus in '15.
I do believe the carry now is often but just thinking about '15 because I do believe under your five year plan the Marcellus is probably the biggest free cash flow negative piece of your growth profile.
Right.
I mean when you think about it the carry now as we get through October and weâ€™re almost through October we would envision the carry coming off for November when you look at forecast for next year it could easily stay off for all of next year.
I would say when we look at the capital we have good meetings with our partner just as we've done every year where we sit down and look at the environment and look at what we want to do both on the dry gas and wet gas side and that's what we'll be doing and continuing to do over the next month or two.
So it's too early to speculate on where we will go on that but we will be looking at all of those pieces.
I would say the encouraging thing that we've seen out there is what Gary's talked about on just overall well performance in some of these items.
And it's just been amazingly when look at how much that thing has continued to evolve from when we first got into that play.
Okay.
Just a quick follow-up you highlighted an improved oil mix in Q4 versus Q3.
What's the driver to that? Is that focus on East Pony? Anything else? That the piece of it very mentioned that the large number of new wells coming on East Pony but it's really driven by probably 60% of that increase is driven by the DJ and 40% of it's by the West Africa lifting schedules and actually everything being on full board for the fourth quarter.
So you see a nice uplift in oil volumes from both international oil and domestic oil for the fourth quarter.
Following up on Dave Heikkinen question of kind of doing more with less.
If you look at CapEx in the third quarter it came in well below expectations yet you brought a couple more wells online in the domestic portfolio than the prior schedule.
4Q same number of wells scheduled to come online as the prior schedule but running nine rigs.
Can you talk about this being a reflection of ongoing efficiency gains both on the drilling and completion side maybe provide some color around the latest digital times cost etcetera.
We are seeing continued especially on the drilling side just some remarkable continued efficiency and improvements on drilling times.
I think they continue to set a record about every quarter for lateral length per day drilled in the Marcellus especially as the teams really continue to increase the learning curve in that area but also seeing in the DJ.
We mentioned the nine rigs in the DJ.
The difference there from what we had previously with 10 was the one rig we moved over to Nevada.
But the forecast and what we've laid out in the fourth quarter has for the nine rig program in the DJ basin but continued to be impressed how they've increased efficiencies.
Don't know where the technical limited yet but we've got to be getting close to it as much as we've seen the improvement on but continue to be amazed by how just focusing on each aspect of the drilling curve and the drilling leg each interval if you will and looking at what's the technical limits for each interval and continuing to push towards that we continue to see improvements.
But Gary can expand on that if he has something.
Yes I guess the only thing I would add you mentioned our 4Q well online targets is unchanged from before.
We moved the rig to Nevada that was part of the plan all along.
So that's probably why it didn't change.
And then the reality is that most of the wells that are coming on in 4Q have already been drilled.
So dropping a rig there wouldn't have any impact anyway.
But Dave is exactly right the efficiencies keep coming.
We do continue to see new records being sent especially in the Marcellus and so we look forward to the benefits of that greater efficiency on both capital as well as our being able to drill more wells with fewer rigs.
And one last one just in the DJ.
With respect to the production you're seeing on each one of the intervals either in Niobrara A B and C or Codell.
How are those tight curves bearing? Are they maintaining consistency kind of across the board? Is there one area thatâ€™s better than another that you might target instead in 2015 to enhance capital efficiency? Anything you can comment on that side would be great.
I guess all I would say is that performance of the zones across the basin is different.
They're not the same all the way up in East Pony as they are down in the core part of the field A B or C.
We certainly aim to target the best intervals in each area to impact capital efficiency as you mentioned.
So at the same time as we continue to test down spacing and how weâ€™re laying out those wells what types of patterns we're using weâ€™re testing multiple intervals in each area.
So way too early to say weâ€™re only going to focus on one or two of those four potential zones in any one area but we're continuing to focus on the best ones.
I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question with regards to some of the midstream related constraints.
This was an issue you highlighted last quarter for a slower second half growth outlook.
Can you just talk about how you see the growth trajectory in the DJ into next year? It's a little but a follow-up on one of the David Tameron's questions.
And add any more specifics on the DCP constraints.
In other words based on the trajectory -- based on the various plants that you highlighted that are coming online how much room do see to increase the day production sequentially over the next three quarters.
Well I think DJ is going to be a big driver of next year's growth.
If you just look at how you're going to ended there this year with the big ramp up through the fourth quarter and then combined with the large facility they are coming online next year you have 200 million a day or so plant of DCPs coming on about the second quarter next year.
We mentioned some of these big compressor projects and other things.
We mentioned our facilities that are coming and going in starting fourth quarter this year into first quarter next year.
It will be a big increase in capacity overall that will continue to set us up for DJ to be one of the big growth drivers next year and not just growth driver but value driver when you look at that oil and gas mix there.
And it's sounds like the second quarter is when that DCP plant is starting up in your-- It should be.
I think probably early second quarter to ramping up through the second quarter by mid-year it should be fully up and running.
And then a lot of questions were asked earlier with regards to how you're thinking about next year.
Maybe I will try to ask it a slightly different way which is how do you think about your tolerance for outspending cash flow.
Is there a specific number you fix? And does that tolerance actually rise in a lower oil prices environment versus a higher one.
I don't know Brian I mean it there's always a tolerant level at some point but that's not been established yet until we've moved to some of our analysis and look at some of the sensitivities.
As Ken mentioned weâ€™re going to be sensitive to our balance sheet.
Weâ€™re going to be sensitive to investment grade.
So weâ€™re going to look at all those different factors and then weâ€™re going to look at the project mix and what's the appropriate spending level to drive that given what we see the cash flow outlook to be as we talked about we have a good hedge book.
We've got a good position on both oil and gas and (indiscernible) are on especially the oil side of that equation and you got a good mix of international oil and domestic oil domestic gas.
But you also -- when it's nice to have that components of gas in Israel at nice prices too.
So that's a nice cash flow to continue to count on.
So it all gets back to that portfolio and again I think especially in this type of environment diversified portfolio that's all underpinned by high quality assets in each area is a -- I don't want to call it a luxury but it's sure nice to have.
Great thanks.
I want to thank everybody again for participating in the call today.
