Greetings and welcome to the Superior Energy Services' First Quarter Earnings Call.
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.
A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
As a reminder this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Paul Vincent Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you.
You may begin.
Good morning and thank you for joining today's conference call.
With me today are Superior's President and CEO Dave Dunlap and CFO Robert Taylor.
During this conference call management may make forward-looking statements regarding future expectations about the company's business management's plans for future operations or similar matters.
The company's actual results could differ materially due to several important factors including those described in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call management will refer to non-GAAP financial measures.
In accordance with Regulation G the company provides a reconciliation of these measures on its website.
With that I'll now turn the call over to Dave Dunlap.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong> Thank you Paul and welcome to everyone listening to our call this morning.
I'll review first quarter activity.
Robert will discuss the segment results.
And I'll share some color on our outlook before turning the call over to Q&amp;A.
For the first quarter of 2015 Superior Energy generated revenue of $917 million EBITDA of $184 million and a loss from continuing operations of $1.5 million or $0.01 per share.
Beginning in December and throughout the first quarter our customers began to aggressively cut oil and gas drilling and completion activity as they substantially reduced their capital expenditure levels.
Pricing of services also declined sharply over this period.
While this behavior was expected following the oil price collapse during the fourth quarter it has been challenging to adjust our operations and cost structure at the same pace with which rigs were released and activity slowed.
With that said I'm very pleased with the way that our leadership has responded to the challenge.
We have taken aggressive cost reduction measures during the first quarter.
And we'll further adjust our cost base as the year progresses.
Our efforts to this point include balancing our workforce head count salaries and wages with our current activity levels; exiting locations we don't believe can generate acceptable returns in this environment; and identifying further opportunities to compress overhead.
We made great strides in eliminating costs from our business and these efforts will continue.
We aren't waiting for the market to get better.
We're actively altering the cost structure of our business so we can be competitive in a smaller market.
Win market share as our weaker competitors stumble and be a partner of choice for new and existing customers as activity levels increase in a more balanced market.
The fragmented U.S.
land market has borne the brunt of activity declines.
And it may be some time until there is a meaningful service recovery to speak of in North America.
With that in mind our operational focus is on maintaining work with the customers that we were working for in the fourth quarter last year.
Said differently we are preserving market share with our best customers.
We will not pursue breakeven or worse business with new customers and wear out equipment for the sake of keeping it active.
Oil and gas prices need to recover and operators need to realize cost and efficiency gains before increasing activity levels.
When that occurs service quality will become a priority and we will have well-maintained equipment ready to deploy with minimal capital outlays required.
In the event a recovery happens in the near term the combination of our structural cost reductions and available capacity should equate to strong operating leverage.
Financially our operating discipline has resulted in a very strong balance sheet good liquidity and free cash flow.
As a result we are well positioned to pursue acquisitions as they present themselves over the course of the year.
I mentioned on our last conference call that we would preserve cash and liquidity until we have a clear understanding of acquisition opportunities that become available.
Nothing has changed.
We will be diligent and disciplined in our acquisition strategy.
And if nothing meets our criteria for acquisition we will seek the best alternatives available for using our cash as we have in the past.
The second quarter of 2015 is likely to be worse than the first quarter as the entire period will be impacted by the full effect of reduced activity and pricing which began in earnest during the first quarter.
We believe the longer the current environment persists the more likely that larger diversified service providers with strong financial capabilities and geographic reach will outperform smaller concentrated providers who will increasingly find it difficult to maintain market share and competitive footing in a smaller market.
With that I'll turn the call over Robert.
Treasurer &amp; Executive VP</strong> Thank you Dave.
As I review each operating segment I will make comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2014.
Drilling Products and Services segment's revenues decreased 16% and income from operations decreased 40% to $199 million and $47 million respectively.
U.S.
land revenue decreased 29% to $62 million.
Gulf of Mexico revenue decreased 6% to $87 million.
And International revenue decreased 14% to $50 million.
Revenue decreases in this segment are mostly entirely attributable to reduced levels of activity and pricing pressure across most product lines.
In the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment revenue of $351 million was lower by 25% and the segment recorded a loss from operation of $1 million down from income from operations of $41 million.
This segment was impacted significantly during the quarter by rapid decreases in oil and gas drilling and completion activity.
Utilization and pricing moved downward across all product lines in this segment in conjunction with the approximate 800 rig decline in the U.S.
rig count during the quarter.
Our Production Services segment revenue decreased 27% to $252 million which resulted in a loss from operations of $23 million.
U.S.
land revenue decreased 35% to $145 million.
Gulf of Mexico revenue decreased 10% to $26 million.
And the International revenue decreased 10% to $81 million.
The primary drivers for decreased revenues in these segments are attributable to the rapid deterioration in the North America land market.
Our coil tubing fishing pressure control tools and slickline product lines all experienced intense activity and pricing related declines.
The coil tubing business is especially challenged as a result of significant oversupply and a persistently weak natural gas market.
This is an example of a business where we are reducing our cost structure to ensure that it is appropriately sized for the market.
Internationally these product lines fared better and results for the quarter were consistent with our expectations given a slowing activity environment and pricing pressure.
In the Technical Solutions segment revenue was $115 million an 11% decrease from the fourth quarter leading to an operating loss of $1 million.
U.S.
land revenue decreased 25% to $18 million.
Gulf of Mexico revenue decreased 2% to $72 million.
And the International revenue decreased 20% to $25 million.
The operating loss in Technical Solution was due to the rapid decline of commodity prices and in the project oriented nature of the product lines in this segment.
Sequential financial comparison is impacted by a positive fourth quarter adjustment to DD&amp;A associated with our oil and gas property and higher fourth quarter revenues in our Marine technical services product line related to the timing of project charges to our customer.
Turning to the balance sheet and our liquidity.
Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.46 times and our debt-to-capital ratio is 28.9%.
Our total debt at quarter-end was $1.6 billion.
Free cash flow of $111 million after normal course of business capital expenditures for the quarter of $127 million resulted from improvements in working capital capital spending discipline and a focus on operational quality.
In addition to the normal course of business capital expenditures the company spent approximately $67 million to buy out the leases of two vessels which are currently for sale.
That amount includes the extinguishment of a $21 million capital lease obligation associated with one of the vessels.
We expect to sell these vessels for approximately same price that we paid for them.
Ownership of these vessels reduces the complexity of the sales process and eliminates approximately $2.5 million of lease payments per quarter until they are sold which we expect will happen in 2015.
There were no shares repurchased during the quarter.
Our cash balance grew by $22 million during the quarter and has continued to build during the second quarter.
From a modeling perspective for the second quarter we believe G&amp;A expense should remain relatively unchanged and should be in the neighborhood of $150 million.
First quarter G&amp;A of $150 million was below expectation as the organization responded quickly to the declining activity and was successful in reducing expense in this category.
With respect to DD&amp;A we believe a range of $162 million to $166 million in the second quarter of 2015 reflects an appropriate level of expense and is consistent with the first quarter.
Second quarter interest expense should be in the range of $24 million to $26 million.
Our effective income tax rate was 37% for the quarter and we would expect it to stay in that range during the second quarter.
I will now turn the call back over to Dave who will discuss our outlook.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong> Thank you Robert.
There are two primary themes unfolding in the oilfield services industry.
First is an immediate need to alter cost structure to compete in the shrinking oilfield services market we are now serving.
Second the overcapacity of equipment particularly in North America will present obstacles to profitability and product lines such as coiled tubing and horizontal well fracturing that virtually all market participants will struggle with.
At Superior Energy our cost reduction efforts commenced as soon as customer activity began to soften.
Typically we would expect head count reductions to occur well ahead of wage reductions.
To date labor costs have responded concurrently with pricing concessions we have made to our customers.
This is definitely occurring earlier in this cycle than we expected based on previous downturns.
We attribute this to a combination of the pace of the downturn as well as the proximity of many workers to the economics of the services they are providing.
The bottom line is that after several years of spending growth and areas with insufficient oil and gas service infrastructure to support it employee related expenses such as travel lodging and per diem expenses to name a few had grown to a much higher proportion of total costs than historical averages.
As the shale revolution moves out of its infancy as consolidation occurs and development programs mature we should be able to push inflation and inefficiency that has accompanied the explosion in activity in North America out of the system.
Labor has and will continue to relocate to these maturing basins.
As this happens the expenses associated with a large transient workforce should moderate.
This would represent a change to our cost structure that should be long-lasting and help us move these expenses back in line with historical averages.
This will happen over time and will be easier to accomplish for larger well-capitalized and diversified operators.
We believe we meet this criteria and are well positioned to improve our cost structure and margins in a more balanced market.
As we are observing during this reporting season North America has weakened substantially relative to international markets.
Coiled tubing and horizontal well fracturing particularly have seen meaningful market shrinkage and substantial margin erosion.
The coiled tubing businesses has been severely impacted by this downturn and faces structural challenges going forward.
With pricing for coiled tubing alternatives coming down the size of the coiled tubing market in North America is at risk.
With high levels of competition and a weak market that isn't likely to get better in the near term our approach has been to downsize our fleet and maintain idled equipment to facilitate operating leverage should the market expand.
We'll also continue to transfer equipment to alternate markets internationally and put it to work.
The horizontal well fracturing market has also been affected by too much equipment pricing erosion and irrational behavior from smaller weaker competitors all of which has negatively impacted margins.
These competitors are working at pricing levels we can't justify.
And many are delivering marginal execution quality.
That behavior doesn't create opportunities to gain market share and maintain profitability.
We have the wherewithal to maintain our equipment and focus on our existing client base and we'll do just that.
As the competitive landscape regains a semblance of balance we'll pursue market share and add to our track record of delivering high quality execution for our customers.
Internationally we continue to progress our objective of focused geographic and product line expansion.
In Argentina we've begun coiled tubing operations and will deploy additional assets transferred from the U.S.
during the course of 2015.
Drill pipe rentals in Argentina also gained traction during the first quarter.
Coiled tubing and stimulation equipment is being transferred to India and should be in position to begin work during the second half of 2015.
I like what I see in India and believe we'll have further opportunities to expand in the future.
Looking at our existing product lines in core international geographies completion tool revenue in Indonesia was lower during the quarter as project revenue associated with activity in the fourth quarter was not repeated in Q1 which isn't unusual for this product line.
In Brazil onshore stimulation revenue was lower as this product line which was impacted by a general reduction in oilfield activity corresponding with lower oil and gas prices.
We still expect international spending to be down 10% to 15% in 2015 but believe that our revenue in core countries will outperform the overall market.
Gulf of Mexico revenue was the least impacted of our geographic areas on a sequential basis.
Although revenue will take another moderate step down in Q2 as a result of a full quarter impact of activity and pricing declines we are gaining confidence that the Gulf of Mexico market holds steady in the second half of 2015.
Clearly geographic diversity is an attribute of Superior in this difficult market environment.
Against the backdrop of declining commodity prices and customer spending is a significant merger of our two largest competitors.
This combination will create ripples throughout our industry and present opportunities around the world to pursue market share introduce new product lines to existing markets and enter new geographic areas.
Regardless of what happens in North America the international market is losing a major competitor.
And we believe we will be a direct beneficiary of this change in the marketplace.
Over the near term we are reacting as quickly as possible to the dynamics of the market and our customers' behavior.
Until the market stabilizes it is difficult to make longer term structural adjustments.
When that does occur our emphasis will be on altering our business through reduced overhead appropriate structuring of our segments and continuing to improve the efficiency of our business.
This will allow us to be profitable.
Even in a smaller balanced market this isn't going to be easy.
But we have the right people from the executive team all the way out to the field level to take every opportunity this downturn presents and improve our competitive position.
And with that we'll open up the line for questions.
Thank you.
We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.
We also ask that you please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up only.
Our first question comes from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James.
Please proceed with your question.
Your line is live.
Inc.</span></strong> Morning guys.
Dave the – you gave us some good detail on the cost reductions.
I'm just curious could you give us a little more color on the timing of those? Are they – do you have them all in place in the second quarter? Does it go into the third quarter and beyond? And how much of it is labor versus vendor type cost reductions? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah Marshall.
So I mean during the course of the first quarter most of our cost reductions were related to labor.
Not all just in head count as I mentioned.
Also in wages and those employee-related costs travel per diem lodging all of those things.
But I'd say the bulk of the cost reductions that we experienced during the first quarter were related to labor.
I mean we did take actions to close some facilities.
We'll be continuing to do that as we right-size the business for current market environment.
We got some work done on G&amp;A which was helpful kind of later in the quarter.
But we'll continue to work on G&amp;A cost as the year progresses.
So I mean what you see in a Q1 result certainly doesn't bake in all of the cost reduction efforts that we had during the course of the first quarter nor are we finished.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
The follow-up.
I guess on those costs we – I didn't see a lot of or any one-time charges you pulled out whereas most of your larger cap peers resorted the usual smoke and mirrors to see massive charges that of course we analysts pull out.
And that way they made their numbers.
You seem to have made your numbers without doing that.
Did I miss something? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> No.
I don't think you did.
We try to avoid smoke and mirrors.
I think that there is – we have done everything that we can to minimize the cost associated with the reductions that have taken place.
And listen this is cash.
It's all about preserving shareholder value.
And from my standpoint we need to cut cost.
And we'd like to expend as little of our funds as we have to in order to carry that out.
And I think that so far we've done it.
Inc.</span></strong> All right.
Thank you very much Dave.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> You're welcome.
Our next question comes from Blake Hutchinson with Howard Weil.
Inc.</span></strong> Morning guys.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Good morning.
Inc.</span></strong> Just wanted to take a moment to address your commentary regarding your strategy here to preserve market share with your good customers from 4Q stack equipment maintain it and have it ready to deploy in the event of an upturn.
Is that – I mean up until now I think you've kind of just applied that to pressure pumping.
Hear from your commentary that certainly coiled tubing would fall in that category.
Is that now just a kind of a blanket statement for the U.S.
franchise? Or – and kind of everything has hit a margin standpoint where it has triggered that reaction? Or are still facets of the business where you're kind of letting local management handle that decision? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I mean we leave a lot of these decisions up to local management.
And I think the message that we're hearing from the field and certainly the field is hearing from us is that wearing out assets that don't make money doesn't make a lot of sense.
And so we want to continue to service those customers that we have serviced in the past.
We're not out seeking new customers or gains in market share in business lines where we – that are not additive to the bottom line today.
And unfortunately the way pricing has regressed over the course of the last four months or five months there's not a lot of product lines where we are making much money today.
Right? Inc.</span></strong> Right.
I guess following up on your international commentary there were some kind of one-time callouts of hits in Technical Services and as well as maybe a little bit of a disappointment in the pace of activity in Brazil.
I would also assume that the North Sea I guess took a big hit in the period.
And having absorbed some kind of one-time issues and taking your year-over-year commentary would somewhere in the $150 million kind of quarterly revenue run rate be a logical way to think through the contribution from international over the course of the year? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> So I mean I think our comments about international revenue from a forward-looking standpoint are really kind of consistent with what we said last quarter which we expected international to be down around 10% or 15%.
And I think our belief at this point is that that prediction will hold true.
And so a lot of the reduction that we expected in international happened in the quarter happened early in the quarter.
And I think we're selling into kind of a run rate internationally that we can expect to see going forward.
So I don't know if I answered your question perfectly but that's the way we see it.
Inc.</span></strong> No.
I think that the gist of it was that we'd kind of absorbed a lot of the pain early and we're settling to that run rate.
So I appreciate that.
That's great.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> You bet.
Inc.</span></strong> I'll turn it back.
And our next question comes from Jeff Spittel with Clarksons Plateau Securities.
Thanks.
Morning Dave.
Morning fellas.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Jeff.
Dave you referenced the opportunity internationally with the merger between a couple of the larger competitors.
Could you give us a sense of how quickly those conversations about that opportunity come to fruition with the customers? Or does it happen now proactively? Or do you have to wait until the deal closes? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I think it's happening a little bit differently with customers in different parts of the world.
I would say at this point it's still conversational.
And I would really expect that – so much international business is done on a contractual basis.
And where you've got multiyear contracts in many cases.
So I don't look for any significant impact just as a result of that combination during 2015.
For me it is longer term than that.
It's a 2016 2017 and 2018 story.
And it's really not different.
It's not driving our strategy any differently internationally.
It's basically just putting us in a position where some of the things that we would be doing from a growth standpoint have the opportunity to be accelerated a bit.
But I don't think you should expect to see much in the way of results of that during 2015.
Sure that makes sense.
And maybe a big picture question.
I think we touched on last quarter building out the international expansion around the core businesses and then filling in with the complementary businesses.
As the business evolves and you move Superior up the food chain globally where does technology development fit in there when you look at your portfolio versus some of your larger peers? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> It's a great question.
I mean I think in general what we see internationally is a bit more emphasis on technical service partners with service companies than what we see in the U.S.
And so all of the product lines actually as time goes on will continue to have development and the technology development requirements which are driven by international customers.
And I feel good about our ability to respond to that.
We do have certain product lines where those technology efforts are more intense.
And probably the one that fits that category the best is in completion tools which for us today are sand control completion tools.
And we've got an R&amp;D component of that business which is constantly having to develop new technology in order to help our customers solve their evolving technical challenges.
But all of them internationally will have an element of technical development associated with them.
Appreciate the color Dave.
Thanks.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> You bet.
Our next question comes from Ken Sill with Global Hunter Securities.
Yeah.
Good morning Dave.
God.
The more you talk the more questions I have.
I'm kind of surprised at that comment that you think that international has seen most of the worst already.
That wouldn't be what you'd typically expect given spending patterns there.
Is that kind of more unique to Superior in the markets that you are in? Or is it something you think has more application to the industry as a whole? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I mean maybe it has more application to us.
I don't know.
I mean we don't participate in every one of the international markets and I think some of the markets that probably continue to have some downward pull to them as the year progresses places like Russia or perhaps Mexico or places that we either don't participate at all or don't participate in a very significant way.
So it may have to do with the countries we participate in.
I know that in the places that we are active we saw activity decline.
And we saw what I would describe as some moderate pricing pressure during the quarter.
And things seem to have settled out since then.
And that's probably as much as anything what's driving our outlook commentary regarding international.
Okay.
And then one of the areas you guys are moving into that you're very optimistic about that you mentioned was India.
And I was wondering if you could give us a little more clarity into how you see that opportunity evolving? Is that primarily an offshore play? Or do you think India is ever going to make a move to develop an onshore program also? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well India historically has had both an onshore and an offshore market.
And in fact our starting point is onshore.
We did a small acquisition there in the second half of 2014 that's our launching pad.
It's a cased hole wireline predominantly in the well test business.
But it's a good franchise and one that's well respected in the land marketplace.
And so we're adding product line to it.
I think that it ultimately will expand into the offshore market.
We have a product line which certainly fits very well there.
And I know our completion tool guys have spent some time in India here recently.
So...
I mean can you give us an idea of just how big that market is now versus what you see the potential to be? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah so I mean for us it's under...
Not a very important market in the world.
(28:31) Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> For us it's under $20 million in revenue.
I mean I don't think that India has near term the same kind of market potential that we have in Argentina for instance.
But I can certainly see India over the course of say a four- or five-year growth period being something that is in excess of a $40 million or $50 million country for us.
Now that doesn't sound like a lot within the context of what we are.
But this is about adding steady and reliable revenue and earnings sources in a lot of different countries.
And it's just another spoke in the wheel.
All right.
Thank you.
I let somebody else ask the next question.
Your next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with SunTrust.
Inc.</span></strong> Hey.
Thanks for letting me in the queue.
Real quick on the onshore completion market in your segment.
What were exit rate margins for the segment? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I don't know we specifically cited exit rate margins in any of our comment.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And I take it that you don't want to.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> No.
I mean listen one thing you got to understand Chase and we've tried to be really cautious about this and we'll continue to be cautious about it.
It's not like we dropped and are at a steady state.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> And so anything that I give you on exit rate if it caused you to believe well okay that's where Q2 is going to lie is probably misleading.
I mean just look at the rig count.
Rig counts continued to trickle down.
And we think it continues to trickle down during the course of the quarter.
Pricing pressure continues to be in the marketplace.
And although the pace of pricing pressure has certainly slowed down some since February it's still out there.
I mean you still got a market that's probably got 50% more capacity than it needs.
And a lot of small competitors are trying to make payroll.
So I just want to – I would prefer not to give you exit rate data points that mislead you about what the second quarter or rest of the year may look like.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
All right.
So can we talk about pressure pumping real quick? Your onshore business at least did – it surprised versus my expectations.
And I'm trying – so if you think about pressure pumping revenues how much were pressure pumping revenues down sequentially? And then kind of can you frame kind of what pressure pumping margins were in the first quarter? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
So pressure pumping revenue was down think in the range of 25% to 30%.
From a margin standpoint pressure pumping – and I don't think we're any different than anybody else.
Pressure pumping margins were also probably more impacted by pricing than any other product line.
We think overall pressure pumping pricing was probably down once again about 20% during the course of the quarter.
We were still at a positive margin in pressure pumping in total for the quarter.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And you're talking EBIT right? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yes.
But from an operating income standpoint we were not negative in the quarter.
How's that? Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
All right.
And let's see last one.
Are you seeing customers kind of move away from 24-hour ops in pressure pumping? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well this is interesting.
I mean there's certainly some interesting and unusual behavior that we're seeing with customers over the last few months.
I told you guys when we reported Q4 and at the time we reported Q4 everything that we had was working 24/7.
I can't say that today.
I mean we've seen customers that have requested that we go – move off of 24/7 schedules.
We've had some that want to stay on 24/7 but only five days a week.
And we've got some customers that are preferring to go well-to-well.
So the interesting thing about this is that when you do that you're giving up some efficiency.
And so it has been fairly rare in our industry that we've seen customers that have deliberately avoided being 100% efficient or operating at maximum efficiency.
We saw some of this in 2012 in the second half of the year you may recall.
And we're starting to see some of those same things creep into the market today where I guess they're looking at their overall spending plans and realizing that they have gained efficiency and don't want to exceed their budgets.
So that has crept into the marketplace.
I mean I gave you a long answer to your question.
Inc.</span></strong> Yeah.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> We're not operating all of our fleets at 24x7 though.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
All right.
Thanks Dave.
War Eagle.
Our next question comes from Byron Pope with Tudor Pickering Holt.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Morning guys.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Hey Byron.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Dave as it relates to the Drilling Products and Services segment I realize it's a fairly high fixed cost business.
So I'm just trying think through the geographic components.
I would assume that the U.S.
onshore part of DPS continues to trend down with activity.
But I tend to think that the Gulf of Mexico and international parts of that segment as being more resilient.
So could you just share your thoughts on how you see the outlook for that segment among the three geographic regions? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
No problem.
Just to correct something you said it's not a high fixed cost business it's a low fixed cost business which is part of the challenge when you see the kind of revenue deterioration that we have.
There's not a lot to cut in the way of cost.
It's not a very labor intensive business.
And so when as...
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Yeah that's what I was (34:05) thinking.
Sorry.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah sure.
I thought you probably just misspoke.
It's – so I guess in essence we don't have the same kind of cost reduction opportunities variable cost reduction opportunities in the rental tool business that we have in our more service intensive businesses.
And clearly what we've seen is activity decline demand decline in the North American land market to a lesser extent internationally.
And once again to a lesser extent in the Gulf of Mexico.
But I mean those rental businesses that operate at very high margins are going to have very high decrementals when the revenue comes down.
I don't know that we saw anything here on the rental side that surprised us.
From a margin standpoint of course total segment margins are holding up quite well.
The only product line within the segment that I would say is a bit different than what I just described would be in the accommodations business which does have a bit higher labor component to it.
And probably from a performance standpoint looks a lot more like our North American service businesses than it does the rental tool businesses.
Did that help answer your question? Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Yeah.
That does.
And then just one additional question if I could.
Realize you guys will generate healthy free cash flow this year.
I heard the Q1 CapEx.
But how are you guys thinking about full year CapEx this year? And I would assume that whatever that level is it's primarily maintenance.
But just curious as to your thoughts there? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah it's – I mean we're still thinking as we did last quarter around $400 million in total.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Which is down about 35% from 2014.
There is a bit of growth capital included in that $400 million mainly in international which we will continue with.
But you're right.
Maintenance is the – maintenance capital is the bulk of the budget.
And I've been asked questions about that maintenance capital budget.
I feel very strongly that we want to continue to have equipment even if it's parked on the fence that is in good working order.
And we're capable of doing that from a cash flow standpoint.
And I still think that that's one of the best things that we can do with our cash in this company so...
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Thanks.
I appreciate it.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> You're welcome.
Our next question comes from Brad Handler with Jefferies.
Thanks.
Good morning guys.
Some of the conversations over the last week have included that customers may be gearing up to do some work on the production side of the business maybe somewhat more quickly.
So there has been some looking for stabilization on the production work the well servicing side in your case perhaps.
There's a conversation underway around completions.
And then ultimately also maybe more eventually around drilling I guess.
I'm curious your sense of if there is any difference in how quickly one – you expect to find bottom in the market in those three categories? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
So I mean production-related work certainly didn't have as far to drop as completions-related work did.
And so I don't know that in our production-related businesses like in service rigs that we've been quite as impacted as we would be in the pure completion driven activities.
I will tell you this.
Operator spending in production related activities has declined as well as it has in completions.
And it's not like they're out substituting dollars and going out and running up their expenses in the field and production related efforts.
Remember that's expensed work.
That's not capitalized work for the operators.
And many of them who are financially stressed they're not going to take expense dollars and get rambunctious with the way that they spend them.
So I don't know.
If I hadn't answered your question I apologize.
But I mean we've not seen any kind of a surge in our production related businesses.
And I really don't expect to see one in 2015.
You certainly did answer it.
I guess and perhaps in fairness I don't want to represent that I think others were talking about a surge.
But there was perhaps some sense of yeah all bits and pieces of spending were stopped in Q1 but there might be some I guess I'll use the word normalization.
And production being a relatively inexpensive way to help normalize.
Perhaps that's where that comes from.
But okay if not...
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
...you don't see that necessarily then? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I mean – listen there are production related expenses that are associated with kind of continuing of production.
So I mean as you go through as the well moves through its life cycle and you have problems with the pump or maintenance that needs to done on a pump or perhaps it's a well that has been flowing that you need to change tubing sizes in order to accommodate lower bottom hole pressure.
I mean those are activities that operators will continue to engage in.
I don't know there's an increase in those.
I just think they're activities they continue to engage in.
I have had some comments from people about a workover market or recompletion re-fracturing market that we certainly have not seen any signs of appearing particularly in the oil plays.
I think the operators that I've heard from most recently that are interested in re-fracking have really been talking about it in gas areas.
That makes a whole lot more sense to me.
In that gas wells tend to respond to re-fracturing in a lot more predictable way than oil wells would.
Most of the customers I speak to are still trying to figure out whether or not the re-fracturing opportunity is one that actually is going to be productive for them in oil basins.
So we'll see.
Understand.
Maybe an unrelated follow-up just on Drilling Products and Services.
More generally I know – I think Byron had a couple questions to that effect.
But from a revenue standpoint as you think about the rest of the year how – it sounds like you're signaling a little bit of a falling off in the Gulf of Mexico if I interpreted that comment correctly.
But just maybe generally for the product line how might you expect that to flow through the rest of the year revenue wise? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
Well I mean Drilling Products and Services revenue will be under the same kind of pressure as every other part of our business in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico which our revenue was down 5% in the Gulf of Mexico from Q4.
And some of that was in activity and some of it was in price.
And it didn't all happen on January 1.
So what you're going to see in the second quarter is kind of a continuation of the activity and pricing declines that occurred during the fourth quarter.
And so Q2 is going to be down from Q1.
What my comment related to was that 90 days ago I'd have probably told you that we were – we believed that second half of the year deepwater was probably going to be down a bit from the first half of the year.
And I think we're beginning to gain confidence that we may not see that kind of decline in the second half of the year in the deepwater market which bodes well for Drilling Products and Services because that's such a big part of our overall DPS exposure is to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
Very good.
Thanks.
I'll turn it back.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Sure.
And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse.
Good morning guys.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Hey Jim.
Now that all the good questions have been asked – I always love saying that.
I have something I need you to reconcile for me.
You're not going to work for new customers at a cash flow loss but your production group this quarter lost a chunk of money.
Are you losing money for your good customers but won't lose money for new customers? Can you kind of reconcile where the profitability who you'll work for and what you'll work looking at that first quarter? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
So I mean you answered the question yourself Jim.
So it must have been a brilliant question.
Yeah.
The way prices have settled in in virtually all the product lines certainly a significantly large portion of the product lines the pricing is at a point where with our current cost structure we can't make money.
That's for customers that we worked for in Q4 it would apply to new customers.
And so what we have chosen to do is to stick with the customers that have been good to us over the past several years offer them that price point at which I know that we're not making money.
But I'm not going to go to a new customer and offer him the same price point.
So we're being loyal to the guys who were loyal to us.
And we're not out seeking new customers just to add top line volume when we know all we're doing is wearing out equipment and not making money.
Does that make...
Okay.
And then – that all makes sense.
That all makes sense.
I'm just wondering do you cut back though on some of those good customers? Do you give them more equipment? So you – I mean if I'm one of your good customers and I know you're losing money but you're willing to lose money working for me I might very well come up with some other stuff you can do for me.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well we hadn't been presented that opportunity.
And maybe we are.
And at that point I guess we'll just consider it.
But I mean the idea the concept there the idea of wearing out equipment to not make money is not something that is very palatable to us.
And although we can't just shut the doors to everything – we need to stay in the marketplace and stay competitive – growing top line in an environment where we're not adding to the bottom line is not something that makes sense to us.
Okay I appreciate that explanation.
In the world of M&amp;A everybody – I think my grandmother has been resurrected and she's going to look at buying some of this stuff from the big divestiture.
Everybody seems to be looking.
It seems to me that it's going to be tough for public companies who do due diligence to win much.
Overall though over the next year and a half do you think you will get decent strategic opportunities to make acquisitions other than the combination of blue and red? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I think that there will be opportunities.
Whether or not we execute on those opportunities is going to depend on whether or not we see them as providing the kind of earnings accretion and return accretion that we think makes sense with our hard earned cash.
And so I mean that's always a bit difficult to predict.
But certainly as you know in the past when industry has gone through these types of downturns and down points in the cycle there are opportunities that present themselves.
And we're only interested in good quality assets and good quality companies.
Maybe that narrows the playing field of what we would potentially buy.
But it's back to what we said about this last quarter we really don't know what the full range of opportunities are today.
And I don't know that we'll know any better at the end of this quarter.
In the meantime we'll preserve our cash and preserve our liquidity.
So as the right opportunity – or if the right opportunity presents itself we'll be in a position to respond.
Let me ask it a different way.
In 2009 everybody complained that the down cycle didn't last long enough for any strategic M&amp;A to get done.
Do you think this one will last long enough? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I don't know.
I can't answer that.
I think I can't answer the fact that in 2009 it didn't really last long enough although we did see some M&amp;A activity occurring in 2009.
There was another rather large combination that took place was announced in September 2009.
You may remember that Baker Hughes-BJ [Services] deal.
All right.
Yeah.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> So there were a few things that happened.
And there were few other transactions...
Are those the boats you bought out? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Actually they are.
Are those the boats you bought out? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Appreciate it guys.
Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Sterne Agee.
Agee &amp; Leach Inc.</span></strong> Thanks.
Good morning guys.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Hi Stephen.
Agee &amp; Leach Inc.</span></strong> Two things.
Just while we're on the M&amp;A topic.
To the extent the transaction plays out and something meaningful gets spun out of the two big guys.
Are you at all worried that you're going to see another competitor spawned in the international markets from this? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I mean whatever they would buy is something we're competing with today.
Right? Agee &amp; Leach Inc.</span></strong> That's fair.
That's fair.
But...
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
So I mean – what we know is – yeah.
What we know is that there is a large competitor and Baker Hughes will be going away.
If there is a new one that gets created because they go buy assets associated with this well that's the same competitive landscape we have today and probably with a name that is lesser known with the customers.
So I don't see how it's a negative.
Agee &amp; Leach Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
That's fair.
Thank you.
And then as we think about the margin progression throughout the year is it – if you see a stabilization in activity in the second quarter.
If we make that assumption would the third quarter be the margin trough? I'm talking North America.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> So I'll just speculate with you here a little bit.
I mean one of the things that concerns me about a flat market when you've got roughly 50% more capacity than what the market needs is that pricing actually stabilizes there.
And so I mean historically when we've seen flat spots in the marketplace and we had one as recently as 2013 what we realized was kind of an ongoing downward pressure in pricing.
And it wasn't nearly as severe as the pricing pressure we went through in the first quarter of this year but it's just a – it's a continued downward pull on prices and a flat market.
Agee &amp; Leach Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
No that's helpful.
You always give a good realistic view.
I appreciate it.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> You're welcome.
Our next question comes from John Daniel with Simmons &amp; Company.
Hey Dave.
Thanks for squeezing me in.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Hey John.
I guess first one from me would be just a sort of housekeeping.
But can you remind us where your frac horsepower is today? And how much of that is idle? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
So I didn't tell you that.
And it's another one I don't mean to be elusive here but active equipment and utilization is continuing to be a moving target.
And what I don't want to do is – as I said about March exit rates earlier I don't want to point to a data point in a moment in time and cause people to believe that it's somehow frozen there.
Instead maybe a way I can answer the question John is by telling you where I think we wind up.
And where I think we wind up is with somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of our overall total horsepower available parked.
Okay.
Got it.
Thank you.
And then you mentioned the goal of being profitable.
I guess I'll put you on the spot here.
But is there any chance you see Superior returning to profitability by Q4? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Listen I hate the idea of losing money.
Yeah.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> It's painful.
It's something that I promise you there's nobody in this shop that is satisfied with.
And what we will do as the year progresses is we will continue to work on our cost base because I firmly believe that regardless of how bad the market is a company that generates $3 billion to $3.5 billion in revenue ought to be able to find a way to make money.
I can't tell you that it'll be in the fourth quarter.
I wish that I could.
What I can tell you is that we're going to keep working on the cost base until we reach a point where we are profitable.
Okay.
Fair enough.
Here's one I guess it'll be directed to you but you can speak for the industry on this.
But I mean how long are you willing to – and again you you can substitute industry there.
But how long are you willing to operate at a loss with good customers before you go back to them and say hey we got to have some sort of relief here? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Oh I don't think that's very long.
I mean I think that we'll be constantly in those customers' offices trying to make them understand that the current pricing levels are not sustainable.
Yeah.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> They're not industry-wide they're not sustainable.
And if this down cycle were to extend for a few years you're going to find a marketplace that doesn't have the kind of capacity to satisfy today's demand.
Right.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> And so I think we'll constantly be reminding our customers that this is not a sustainable operating model.
It is not a sustainable pricing level.
And of course I'm sure what my customers will turn around and tell me is that we don't think so either.
We don't think that $50 a barrel is sustainable for our operations.
Right.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> And you can look at their results and see that it's not.
Well do you think that I mean just hypothetically speaking here let's say we stay sort of $60-ish $55 $60.
And you get towards the end of the year and it's the time for E&amp;Ps to go out and send out all their RFPs for the upcoming year.
Is that the time where you – we realistically see that discussion take place in terms of the price release especially like Q1? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
I think those discussions happen before that.
Okay.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Now listen I'm not trying to set up optimism out there that we're going to go and get...
No.
I...
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> ...price increases during the course of this year because I certainly don't believe that.
But I think the messaging with the customers will be consistent.
And I think they understand that.
I think they understand.
Yeah.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> And what they see in the way of pricing is not something that's going to last forever.
However as I talked about in our prepared remarks we've done a lot of things relative to cost structure around labor.
And what I certainly believe is that a lot of what we've been able to do in the employee related expenses is something that could be sticky.
And that's helpful in a lot of ways because that's helpful for our margin.
It's also helpful for our customers' cost.
Right.
No.
I wasn't trying to get you say you're going to raise prices or anything like that.
I just – these guys they – it's good for E&amp;Ps to have service companies that are taken care of in terms of service quality asset quality and you know where I'm going with this.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yes.
Maybe it's...
Last one.
Just on India the type of horsepower that's being sent over there is it just a couple pumps? Are these big spreads that the market will require? And then that's it from me.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
Sure.
If you remember what a frac fleet looked like in the United States 15 years ago it looks like that.
Oh okay.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> It's not 15-year-old equipment by the way.
I mean these are triplex pumps.
It's not the kind of stuff that we would use in horizontal well fracturing in the U.S.
today.
Okay.
Thanks Dave.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> You're welcome.
Our next question comes from Matt Marietta with Stephens.
Inc.</span></strong> Thanks and good morning.
Thanks for taking the questions.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Hey Matt.
Inc.</span></strong> Wanted to hit on Argentina a little bit more.
You briefly mentioned it.
But it has been an area of growth focus for the company.
If I remember right the expansion into drill pipe took place late last year.
At this point where are we in the coil expansion? And have you began to build out offerings like stimulation in the country yet? And maybe just some general commentary on how things are progressing in Argentina could be helpful? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Sure.
It's progressing very well.
I mean we did – you remember correctly we did add drill pipe late last year.
And we have drill pipe that is on rental there today.
And I think we're talking to customers down there about potentially bringing in more during the course of the year.
We went operational with our first coiled tubing unit which also includes nitrogen I should add.
This is not completions-related coiled tubing work.
This is old-fashioned intervention work with coiled tubing.
And so anyway we went operational with our first coiled tubing unit during the first quarter.
And we have two other coiled tubing units that are targeted to be added to that fleet during the course of 2015.
We've not done anything on stimulation as yet.
I think we continue to see that as an opportunity but not one that we've executed on as yet.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
That sounds positive there.
And you touched on this already some.
There is a growing I would call it almost excitement developing out there with regard to refrac potential in U.S.
markets.
But Dave given your engineering background and you briefly mentioned this but why is this better for gas wells versus oil wells? And can you maybe help us understand the dynamic at work? And why it's more difficult than oil wells? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
So I mean the very basics here are that the gas molecules when you re-excite them will move a lot easier than oil will.
I mean it's just a function of the way the hydrocarbon moves through the rock with greater ease.
And so – and re-fracturing gas wells a lot of times what we're doing is we're – you may think of it as a fracture entering a new part of a zone that hadn't been stimulated before.
But in a lot of cases what's really happening is we're just – we're moving rock around to a certain extent and exciting gas molecules.
And you just don't get the same kind of effect in an oil reservoir.
Pressure also has a lot to do with this as well.
And so if you're in a dry gas environment where you're not having to fight liquids and as pressure declines another reason why it could be successful on a gas well.
Remembers in oil wells you've got more bottom hole pressure required to lift fluids even to the artificial lift point.
So it's just harder to do.
Listen I talk to a lot of reservoir engineers and people that are a lot – spend a lot more of their time thinking about enhancing recovery in these shales than I do.
And it's a big question mark with a lot of the operators how oil reservoirs will respond to a refrac.
Inc.</span></strong> I guess is there a risk that if you refrac an oil well you end up getting more gas out of the well rather than oil? Is that...
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> No.
The bigger risk is that you wind up spending $2.5 million $3 million and not get a return.
And so I mean they think about am I better off instead of spending $2.5 million $3 million trying to do a refrac that I may not get any return on am I better off doubling that and drilling a new well into a virgin part of the reservoir that I know is going to be productive for me? Inc.</span></strong> That makes sense.
Well thanks a lot for your insight.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> You bet.
Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.
Inc.</span></strong> Hey.
Dave just a question on the pricing side.
So I think pricing hit – pricing came down pretty hard early in the first quarter.
Just curious on a couple fronts.
Have the E&amp;Ps kind of taken their foot off this? Are they kind of satisfied where the things are going? We heard some chatter out of IPAA last week that some of the E&amp;P guys are saying they think there's a whole another – there's potentially more cuts to come.
So I'm wondering one are you concerned there could be more pricing cuts to come? And two is this uniform across – you have a great view of all these different product lines a lot more than a lot of other companies have.
Is it uniform on the pricing side? Or are there certain areas that still might have more to go? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well let me try and add some flavor to all this.
Okay? It's not uniform across the product lines.
It's not uniform geographically.
What we saw in the first quarter was pricing concessions that were driven greatly by the operators.
And their messages were very clear and very quick.
They needed concessions and they needed them in a big way.
And they were bringing in competitors to make sure that they were able to optimize pricing as soon as possible.
The price deteriorations that are continuing in the market I would say are not as much operator driven as they are competitively driven.
And so these are service companies that for whatever reason are not satisfied with their current revenue activity levels and are looking to add revenue at what we see as being suboptimal margin.
So listen and if a service company comes in and offers you as an operator a lower price than the one you're looking at today in this kind of environment you're going to pay attention.
Inc.</span></strong> Yeah.
Just another question totally unrelated.
Gulf of Mexico you talked about kind of the deepwater market staying relatively flat the rest of the year.
What about the shallow water market? I think it was the last call you had talked about that market being in a structural decline.
Anything changed from that view? And could you also just kind of remind us on what your mix is? What your exposure is to that shallow water Gulf? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
So historically we've been about 60% shelf 40% deepwater.
I don't have it sitting right in front me.
But my estimation would be that we're probably close to 50-50 maybe even a little bit more levered to deepwater today.
I need to clarify something.
We're not flat in the Gulf of Mexico with Q1.
I think that what we believe is that if you look at where we're going to be in Q2 there's probably a reasonably good chance that we stay flat coming out of Q2 from an offshore standpoint.
Deepwater looks like it's going to be holding up a little bit better than what we thought it would going into this year.
Shelf is down.
But shelf is not down so much from Q4 to Q1.
Shelf was down in the second half of 2014 in total.
And Q1 on the shelf is always one that we're impacted from the seasonal standpoint.
So it's kind of a low point for us.
I would not be surprised if our shelf revenue is actually flat maybe up a little bit from first quarter to second quarter just because I mean from a plug and abandonment standpoint from an optional work standpoint you don't do that kind of work in the first quarter.
And we always do more of it in the second quarter.
Inc.</span></strong> Fabulous.
Thanks.
Our last question comes from Jim Schumm with Oppenheimer.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Hey good morning.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Hey Jim.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Dave how much debt are you comfortable with? If I were to offer you a great business at a great price I mean what's your budget? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I don't know that I have a budget.
I mean a great business at a great price listen I don't know.
I don't know that we have a budget.
I certainly have been comfortable with the debt levels that we've had in this company over the last year or so.
Clearly the decisions that we've made from a capital structure standpoint should tell you guys that we're going to be relatively conservative with the way we deal with the balance sheet.
And that has paid good dividends for us now.
So I don't know.
I think you got to look at the opportunity.
And what that good company's cash flow looks like and how much we think that good company is going to be additive to us from an earnings and return accretion standpoint.
I didn't answer your question.
I don't have a budget in mind.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Okay.
And then I apologize in advance because I'm going to ask you another pricing question.
But so we're still hearing some E&amp;P companies talk about another leg down in pricing.
And yet a lot of your peers and you are sort of shifting strategy from maintaining market share to a greater focus on profitability.
So I mean how do you think this plays out? Are there so many smaller competitors out there that maybe are struggling that are willing to drive price down to stay active? Or so potentially we do have another leg down in pricing but you're just not willing to participate at those prices? I mean is that a possibility? Or do you think that we're close to the bottom here? And that maybe you don't want to call a bottom here but that we're very close to a bottom.
And we sort of stabilize here? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
I want to try and get you to think about it in a little bit different way.
I don't think about this as there being another leg down being available from a pricing standpoint.
I think about the fact that there is about 50% more capacity in the market than the market needs.
And as long as you have that much overcapacity you're going to continue to see downward pricing pressure.
It's not nearly as severe as the kind of pressure that we saw during the first quarter.
But it's just constant challenge that you have.
And that doesn't fix itself until the market starts getting bigger.
Or some of the smaller competitors go out of business.
Or you have turnover or a reduction in the overall capacity that's in the market.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Okay.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong> Okay.
Thank you very much for joining us today and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our teleconference.
You may disconnect your lines at this time.
Thank you all for your participation.
