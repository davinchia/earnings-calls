Good day and welcome everyone to the Newfield Exploration Third Quarter Conference Call.
For opening remarks and other housekeeping items I'll turn the call over to Steve Campbell Head of Investor Relations.
Please begin.
Good morning and thanks for joining us today.
By now we hope you've had a good chance to review our release and the @NFX that we issued last night.
The slides in @NFX will be helpful references during our call today.
Following prepared remarks from our Chairman Lee Boothby we will have our executive assembled and ready to take your questions.
As always please limit your time during today's call to one question and one follow-up.
This simply allows us to get to more of your questions.
Let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website along with our earnings release the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations.
Today's discussion contains forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations.
Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today.
A full disclaimer is provided in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q.
Thanks again for dialing in today and I'll turn it over to our Chairman Lee Boothby.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thanks Steve.
Good morning everyone and thanks for dialing in to our third quarter conference call.
Your investment in our company is very much appreciated and we look forward to providing you with a solid operational update today as well as taking your questions at the end of our prepared remarks.
It's hard to believe that 2015 is drawing to close.
Despite the challenges presented by low commodity prices Newfield has worked to differentiate itself from the pack through solid execution quality assets and the sound business plan.
We're executing very well across the organization today.
Although the lion's share of capital is being invested in Anadarko Basin we continue to deliver best-in-class wells in the Williston Basin and we are actively working to improve our base production levels and reduce our cost structure across the enterprise.
We truly have an all-hands-on-deck mentality today and we're aligned to deliver on our key goals.
Just as important as today's production beat is the progress we've made to lower our cost and expenses.
Notice that our third quarter cash operating expenses were significantly lower than guidance.
We are building on these efficiencies as we prepare to enter 2016 and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to the pursuit of margin expansion.
We're successfully retooling our company to be profitable in a lower commodity price world.
Newfield is differentiated in several distinct ways today.
First we're focused.
Over the last five years we've sold non-strategic assets reinvested proceeds into our plays of the future.
We've realigned our organizational structure to reduce G&amp;A expenses while deploying talent to our highest return plays SCOOP and STACK.
Second we've demonstrated the ability to effectively manage the inherent risk in the E&amp;P business.
We took proactive steps last year to ensure our cash flow by hedging a significant portion of our production into 2017.
In addition we strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position through key capital market transactions earlier this year.
Our strong financial footing has been paramount to building shareholder value in today's oil price environment.
We intend to emerge as a better stronger and more profitable company when commodity prices recover.
And lastly we're very fortunate to have an asset that can deliver both strong returns and growth in a low oil price environment.
The Anadarko Basin offers strong returns today and we know that development economics will be significantly better tomorrow.
We are highly encouraged with the results we're seeing today in the Anadarko Basin.
There is a comprehensive update in today's @NFX publication.
You'll see that our teams continue to advance learnings to deliver superior well results optimize completions and improve returns It's important to note that for the first time our net daily production from the Anadarko Basin has now eclipsed the combined production from the remainder of our domestic assets.
This is quite a milestone considering that the SCOOP and STACK plays literally started from scratch just four years ago.
Due to the strong growth from the Anadarko Basin and our efforts to maximize base production across the company we today raised our full year expectations for 2015 production and we will enter 2016 with strong operational momentum.
In STACK we have now drilled nearly 70 wells and have seen strong well results across our acreage.
With each well we gain increased confidence in the play.
Although the primary focus of our STACK drilling program today is to HBP our acreage we are learning about well spacing both on the surface and sub-surface and we will be ready to enter full field development in 2017.
Our growing Anadarko Basin assets provide us with a deep inventory of high return drilling locations that will lead Newfield's growth and profitability for many years to come.
Other critical 2015 initiatives relate to our efforts to improve margins across the company.
We have worked to significantly improve our cost structure.
These gains have many contributors including high-graded capital investments reduced service costs innovative efforts to lower LOE redeployment of our people and the right-sizing of our workforce.
Our estimated 2015 lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis are expected to be nearly 25% below 2014 levels.
We are expecting that LOE will be down an additional 5% to 10% from current levels in 2016.
Our 2015 estimated net G&amp;A expense will be down about $25 million over 2014 levels adjusted for one-time reorganization costs.
Our 2016 G&amp;A expense is expected to be down $40 million from this year's level.
In addition our future realized prices are expected to improve in STACK through better oil price differentials.
We're seeing great demand for our STACK barrels today due to both API gravity crude quality and geographic location.
Before covering our financial results for the third quarter let me make a few preliminary comments about 2016 and how we're seeing our business plan taking shape.
We're running multiple scenarios in preparation for 2016.
Although fluid I can share with you some of the bookends around our analysis.
First we're working toward a capital budget that substantially balances with our expectations for cash flow inclusive of hedge revenues.
As we've said repeatedly our primary focus today is on maintaining liquidity and a strong balance sheet.
We expect to enter 2016 with ample capacity under our $1.8 billion credit facility.
This is an investment grade facility with no redetermination concerns.
Its term was extended earlier this year out to 2020.
We estimate that our maintenance capital funding level is around $900 million.
Nearly $800 million would be associated with drilling and completions and the remainder would be allocated to infrastructure leasehold and land renewals.
At today's strip prices our 2016 hedges should add about $260 million in revenues.
This year our Anadarko Basin volumes will be up nearly 50% over 2014 levels.
We enter 2016 with momentum and expect that the continuing growth of SCOOP and STACK in 2016 will more than offset the natural declines in our other domestic areas that are not receiving capital investments today.
Our production throughout 2016 is expected to be relatively flat throughout the course of the year should we undertake maintenance capital investment levels.
This will put us in a great position to accelerate and again focus on strong growth once the commodity prices provide the appropriate catalyst.
We plan to issue our final 2016 capital budget and guidance along with our fourth quarter and year-end earnings in February of 2016.
We're confident in our plan's ability to maintain a strong balance sheet generate lower operating cost improve our returns and advance STACK toward full field development in 2017.
Let me quickly cover our financial results for the third quarter.
Increasing volumes coupled with improved costs in the unit of production basis define the quarter's highlights.
Margin improvements were evident in our cash operating cost.
On a unit of production basis LOE was 15% below our guidance for the quarter and nearly 25% below the comparable period in 2014.
G&amp;A expense excluding one-time costs associated with our reduction in force and restructuring cost was about $3 million less than guidance.
Our capital investment budget for the year remains approximately $1.4 billion and includes capital invested year-to-date to acquire additional land and leasehold in the Anadarko Basin.
Through the first nine months of this year we sold $77 million of non-strategic assets as we continue to refine our portfolio in high-grade investments.
Year-to-date we've invested about $1.1 billion excluding capitalized interest and internal costs.
There is a helpful table on page four in @NFX that outlines our capital investments by quarter which includes our change in accruals.
In terms of production we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections through solid execution and improving well performance.
Our domestic production in the third quarter exceeded our guidance midpoint by 400 000 barrels led by the Anadarko Basin.
For the third quarter our production in the Anadarko Basin came in about 2 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our forecast split equally among our three primary commodity products.
Total production in the third quarter was 14.3 million barrels of oil equivalent of which 63% was liquids.
Our consolidated oil production during the quarter was 42% higher than the same period of 2014 adjusted for asset sales.
Domestic production was up 10% year-over-year adjusted for asset sales.
Domestic production grew 3% quarter-over-quarter to 12.9 million barrels of oil equivalent.
We lifted about 1.4 million barrels in China during the quarter surpassing our guidance by about 125 000 barrels.
Due to our production outperformance year-to-date we're again raising our annual forecast.
Our full year company guidance is now 55.3 million barrels to 55.8 million barrels of oil equivalent.
Our domestic production is now expected to be 50.0 million barrels to 50.5 million barrels of oil equivalent.
Discretionary cash flow from operations was $280 million or $1.72 per share.
Discretionary cash flows were a couple of pennies light to consensus primarily due to divesting or payout of previously expensed cash-settled restricted stock in the third quarter as well as severance and other reorganization costs.
Adjusted net income for the quarter which excludes several one-time items detailed in our release was $0.21 per share.
The most significant item was a non-cash ceiling test write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices.
As a full-cost company this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q.
This is a non-cash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or debt covenants.
These impairments are a function of full-cost accounting and significantly lower commodity prices in the 12-month trailing average.
Let's move on to our operations update.
I'll spend the rest of today on the Anadarko Basin.
We're excited about our recent results which demonstrate material gains in several important areas.
First improving well performance.
You can see from today's results that our production from the Anadarko Basin is tracking well above expectations.
Today we raised the expectations for our fourth quarter average daily rate from the Anadarko Basin to about 74 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day that's 6 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our beginning of year estimate and 3 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day higher than our estimate last quarter.
Second we're seeing continued gains in drilling efficiencies which are leading towards lower well cost.
In our STACK play our estimate of well cost at the beginning of the year was $8.5 million.
Today we're drilling and completing wells for $7.5 million or less.
Our days to depth are averaging about 16 days and our best-in-class wells are drilled in 12 days.
Third we're effectively optimizing completions.
We're making material advancements in our completions and early results are very promising.
Lastly we're planning for future development.
We have marketing agreements now in place for both oil and gas takeaway in STACK and we're developing an extensive network to allow for the distribution recycling and reuse of our frac flowback water.
This will be advantageous as we enter full field development.
Let's talk about each of these gains starting with the improved well performance.
In @NFX we released results from 22 new SXL wells.
We now have 68 wells in our STACK dataset and the results have been very consistent across an area that covers more than 1 500 square miles and spans more than 50 miles from corner to corner.
In fact there is a tighter correlation in our STACK results than in any of the resource plays we've been associated with to date.
Our most recent wells have higher 30-day and 60-day rates and not all of the wells have yet reached 90-day production rates.
Average 30-day rates from our 22 new wells exceeded last quarter's wells by 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
On a wellhead basis the oil percentage from our new wells averaged nearly 80% over the first 30 days of production.
By the end of this year we expect to have drilled about 100 STACK wells.
This is a very significant dataset and it is providing us with high confidence in our future forecast.
SCOOP is in full development and pad drilling is generating strong returns.
Our recent Williams five-well pad came on at about 6 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross of which 70% was oil on a two-stream basis.
We have two additional SCOOP pads that will begin production shortly and help push our average net production from the Anadarko Basin to about 74 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter.
We continue to lower well cost in STACK through innovative bit designs mud and motor optimizations and the targeting of the most affective drilling zones within the Meramec and the Woodford.
Today well costs are about $7.5 million but more importantly we can see the path to significantly lower well cost once we move to pad drilling and full field development.
We estimate that more than half of the cost savings seen to date is related to efficiencies and field level optimizations and not simply result of lower service cost.
From our participation in outside operator wells we know we are leading industry in drilling days and costs.
Perhaps our most significant developments to date are coming through recent completion optimizations.
Recall that our first 26 STACK wells had identical completions.
We felt early that it was critical to have a large consistent sample set across our acreage footprint.
In 2015 we began to optimize completions in both SCOOP and STACK adjusting different variables to find the optimal well for full field development.
Recent variables explore the use of zipper fracs diverting agents high concentrations of fluids and proppants and slickwater fracs.
We're very encouraged by the early performance results from these optimizations.
Within a larger sample set and time we will know the magnitude of the impact on our EURs and rates of return.
Stay tuned we'll have more to share with you in the way of data very soon.
We recently signed new agreements that will help ensure that we have good markets and the best possible differentials for our growing STACK production.
As of today our STACK oil is trucked to Cushing Oklahoma.
Under our new agreements we'll begin piping about one-third of our STACK production in January of 2016.
And by the end of the second quarter 100% of our STACK oil will be piped into Cushing.
We've seen a growing appetite for our STACK barrel which is a 42 degree to 45 degree API barrel.
We will soon have the ability to batch our oil to ensure the best price.
We expect our differential to NYMEX WTI will decrease from about $4.50 per barrel today to about $2.50 per barrel early next year.
As you can tell our remarks today we are very encouraged with the continuing progress that we're making in the Anadarko Basin and we'll be happy to discuss additional details during our Q&amp;A.
So in closing I'd like to say Newfield is an very good place today.
But we didn't arrive here by chance.
We took the right step 12 months to 18 months ago and hedged forward oil sales to ensure our cash flow.
We upsized and extended our credit facility through 2020 ensuring our liquidity position and eliminating redetermination risk.
And we sold $2.5 billion in assets at yesterday's commodity prices.
These strategic decisions were timely and help put Newfield in an advantaged position today despite a very challenging macro environment.
We're fortunate that we can provide our shareholders with both volumes and value.
Growth and shareholder value creation are not mutually exclusive regardless of where we find ourselves in the inevitable commodity price cycles.
Thanks for your investment in our company and we look forward to taking your questions.
Operator.
And we will take our first question from Richard Tullis with Capital One.
Please go ahead.
Inc.</span></strong> Hey thanks.
Good morning.
Good quarter Lee.
So we saw a nice uptick in the STACK well productivity.
When you take a look at the latest SCOOP oil wells with a 90-day oil production looks like there was a bit of drop in the percentage of oil my calculation is like 42% versus 51% from the earlier results.
I might be off a little bit but what was the main driver for those declines? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I think it's important when you look at the Anadarko Basin and SCOOP and STACK – and I'll get to the specific question in a moment – to remember that we're drilling across various positions that have been phase envelopes.
So you're going to see a natural variation across the play.
We've got plenty of data.
We know where we are in the phase envelopes we know what the expectations are.
But from quarter-to-quarter or dataset-to-dataset you'll have pad wells coming into play.
As we move towards the development you'll have both the noise that comes in from OBO activity as well.
But small variations a few percentage points one way or the other are nothing to be concerned about.
So what I would tell you on the SCOOP wells down there we had the five-well pad that was referenced we're very very pleased with the results and they're in line with our expectations in the play.
And the same is true with regard to STACK.
I can't think the last time we had any surprises with regard to phase composition and production types in this play.
We've got plenty of data and it's pretty well defined at this stage.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And last question from me what's the current oil price realizations in Uinta? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> So the current oil price realizations we continue to sell that crude at a discount -- seeing currently about a $13 differential to WTI.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thanks a bunch.
Appreciate it.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Sure.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
And we can take our next question from Kashy Harrison with Simmons &amp; Company.
Please go ahead.
Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
I know you've outlined a path to balance CapEx and cash flows in 2016 while keeping domestic production flat.
I was hoping you could provide some just early color on what production allocation may look like between the SCOOP oil SCOOP condensate SCOOP Springer and STACK? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I had said carefully that we're going to come out with our final guidance which will include an update on the portfolio well count locations and the 2016 mix in February 2016.
We're going to stick to that schedule.
The commentary on maintenance capital was to give you a reference point.
We've said pretty consistently on the road since earlier this year that in a $50 and below world that you can probably expect Newfield to execute a balanced plan.
We're presently in a $50-ish world.
When you think about it in those regards so we're thinking that more likely than not we'll have a balanced program going into 2016 put ourselves in a position to time the recovery if you will in the commodity and step on the accelerator at the right time.
But balanced program is the right place to go and it will be Anadarko-centric.
We'll have to finish our HBP drilling which will be a large part of our activity in 2016.
And then once we move into the full-field development stage in STACK notionally 2017 forward you'll have a more consistent forecast from that point forward.
Okay.
Thanks for the color there.
And do you have any planned non-core asset divestitures that you may use to fund full field development maybe in 2017? Or just add to liquidity and improve the balance sheet? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well we've been careful to say that – and I think we've demonstrated it with $2.5 billion of asset sales that funded our transformation – every asset has a lifecycle.
So over the course of time and it's not question of if it's when and clearly we do have other assets in the portfolio we could consider for divestment.
But specific answer to your question we have nothing – no planned sales at this point in time.
We do have assets that would be considered for disposition at the right place and time when we choose to accelerate activity in the Anadarko Basin.
So answer to that's yes not today.
Okay.
Well.
Thank you.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Sure.
We'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC.
Please go ahead.
Hey guys I was hoping you could break down the complexion of the wells the 22 wells in STACK you brought on in the quarter in terms of how many of those targeted the Meramec versus the Woodford? And I was just curious if there was any update on any of the previous spacing pilots out there on STACK? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Leo most of the wells in fact probably all of the wells in the quarter were actually Meramec.
So that really answers that.
What was the other question you had? Just looking for an update on some of the previous spacing pilots that you guys have looked at there? Yeah.
I mean everything – we continue to produce above the type curve on those wells.
We've got a total of five wells or five patterns I guess that we've got in place and we have no other plans this year and we'll be looking into 2016 and maybe we can sneak a few more in.
As Lee alluded to earlier our focus is all about the HBP there.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah Leo I think the other thing to remember when you look at the overall dataset as we approach 70-odd wells through the course of the drilling we've got about two-thirds of the total test in the Meramec and about a third in the Woodford if I remember.
I think those are numbers that we've put out previously.
Obviously as we move around HBPing there will be places where we're testing Meramec and places where we're testing Woodford.
But it's been roughly pretty consistent around two-thirds one-third over that time period the last four years.
All right.
That's helpful.
I just wanted to qualify the one comment that you made Lee.
You talked about the theoretical maintenance CapEx of $900 million and flattish production.
Is that flat year-over-year in 2016 versus full year 2015 or was that flat with fourth quarter of 2015? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> It would be flat year-over-year when we're talking about maintenance capital.
But I would say that with the scenarios that we're running at this point in time we would expect quarter-to-quarter in that regime to be pretty flat all the way through the year.
Okay.
Thank you.
And we'll take our next question from Robert DuBoff with Oppenheimer.
Please go ahead.
Inc.</span></strong> Yes.
Hi.
Good morning gentlemen.
It looks like China has outperformed your guidance all year; is it really outperforming expectations or is this just related to the timing of liftings and how should we think about production of that asset going into 2016? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I would say that China is producing in line with our expectations.
It's a function of timing of liftings and we're running slightly ahead of the schedule that we put out at the beginning of the year.
But we're pleased with the performance in China and we'll update you forecast-wise on what that looks like later this year as we get ready for next year.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
And just a follow-up thinking about a more balanced budget for 2016 what would be the appetite for adding acreage in SCOOP and STACK? And can you comment on the market for those assets currently? And kind of your outlook for M&amp;A in a $50 oil price world? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think that – look we've got competitive advantages and strong position and we're going to compete for every acre that makes sense.
Certainly we understand the play and we've got a good strong position and we'll look to add to it opportunistically when those opportunities present themselves.
Inc.</span></strong> All right.
Great.
Thanks for taking my questions.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thank you.
Our next question will come from Ipsit Mohanty with GMP Securities.
Good morning folks.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning.
Just looking at the significant improvement you're showing quarter-over-quarter on STACK wells to the extent that you can what's the biggest reason for these wells? is it just drilling completion techniques or is it something in the acreage that you're going and drilling at various portions? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I'd say that I listed a whole smattering of things that we're testing and I guess the first thing I would tell you is remember that we're relatively early in this dataset.
Not all of the wells have made it to 90 days.
So we had good 30-day and 60-day data.
The focus is on optimizing completions.
And we've kind of got a menu it's sort of an all of the above things that make sense.
I listed diverters we've previously talked about reductions in cluster spacing on the perfs targeting where do you target within the various horizons for the best completions.
It's a combination of a lot of factors and I think the follow-on point that you're probably wanting to ask is when do you see this translate though to EUR.
We'll give you an update on our thoughts on EUR when we come our with our 2016 plan.
But clearly a 100 barrel oil equivalent per day increase in the average quarter-over-quarter.
1 000 barrel a day type 30-day IPs.
We're excited about it.
I think that's the key takeaway.
Great.
Thanks Lee.
And then when you talk about maintenance capital there's another goal I believe of achieving HBP in the STACK.
Is that possible by year-end 2016 with a maintenance capital or you need to push it to 2017? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think that what we said earlier this year is that we were going to stay aggressively focused on HBPing our STACK acreage as that was our pressing need.
Now we're fortunate that we have high return wells that we're drilling we're not in development mode.
So typically we'll drill a 10 000-foot well and we'll protect two sections and then we'll move about two miles away and we'll drill the next two section.
So it's a lot of work we'll be at about 100 wells by end of this year.
We'll need a touch over 200 wells to get the core footprint HBPed.
So it tells you that there'll be a lot of drilling.
The rig count is shifting in favor of STACK.
That's been happening during the course of the year.
I would guess that at a level of funding that you're talking about $900 million $1 billion type funding somewhere in that zip code we'll be 90% plus HBP by the year and we'll finish up the HBP early in 2017.
All right.
Thanks Lee.
Great quarter.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Sure.
Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.
Thank you and good morning.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Morning Dan.
The STACK wells continue to show improvements in productivity whether you measure it in absolute terms or on a per foot of lateral basis.
What should we expect in terms of the rate of change going forward given the completion optimization operations underway today? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think that the shortest answer is that it's still early innings.
I think there's a lot going on a lot that we're doing a lot that other competitors in the play are doing.
I think we're all learning from each other.
Clearly I would expect to see some continued learning and positive results related thereto but the pace the actual rate of that change I'm not going to try to answer that today.
I just think that we're still early innings and there'll be some more wins before this is over with.
Got it.
Thank you.
We'll take our next question from Dan Guffey with Stifel.
Please go ahead.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi guys and congrats on a great quarter.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks Dan.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Just wanted to dive in a little bit more on spacing.
I know you mentioned you're done with spacing tests for this year just curious your thoughts on if 880 feet or six wells per section is the right spacing? And then also on your third and fourth test that you guys did or I guess your third specifically as you were previously defining it you had two in the Meramec that were stacked and staggered vertical spacing was around 175 fee.
Are you seeing any degradation or communication that's pushing down or pulling down some of those production rates from those pilots or are all of them essentially at or above your type curves? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
So let me – I'll start with a high level commentary.
I don't know that we said that we weren't doing anymore pilot tests between now and year-end.
I think we'll have ongoing well pairs two-well pairs.
We have no specific multi-wells spacing pilots being drilled.
But we do continue to – we do plan to continue to drill two-well pairs where we can across the acreage footprint just makes sense so you can gather the information.
I think the results that we've seen from all of the wells that we released to date have been in line or above the published type curve.
So we've been very pleased there.
We've not seen any negative interference effects or degradation.
So another thing to be very pleased with.
The closest we've been able to get is 880 feet I believe.
And the reason for that is when you drill across lease lines State of Oklahoma rules that's as close as we can get.
So practically speaking that's about six wells per horizon if you wanted to think about it at that level.
I think we feel pretty comfortable with the results we're seeing there.
We'll have to wait for the mood the shift into development to drill multi-well pilots and I'm sure we'll test spacing tighter than that once we get there.
But right now we're very encouraged with the results.
We'll continue to add to the dataset.
When we get the acreage footprint HBPed it's going to be a pretty fantastic place to be because we'll have all of that spacing and well performance data before we ever actually get into the development mode.
That's a luxury we haven't had in any of the previous plays.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay great.
So I mean it's sounds like the data what you gathered this year the inventory number that you provided at the beginning of the year this year the inventory in STACK should significantly increase when you put your numbers out in February of 2016 is that correct? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think we're very encouraged.
We'll update the inventory and the well counts and give you that information as part of our year-end dataset consistent with what we've been doing the last two years three years.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
And then again on optimizations I know you said you're kind of – it's a full menu of trying out many different types.
I guess how close do you guys feel like you are to reaching optimization and do you think all of 2016 will get you to where you need to be when you enter full field development mode and actually have a recipe that you consistently use? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> So I would tell that we'll continue to learn as we move through the development of this play.
I would expect to see continued improvements as we said earlier.
I think the key to remember is our team starts at time zero in these plays not to chase press releases and big IPs but to design the development well.
So we're working on the development well designs today.
We want compact tight complex fracture networks and that's really what the focus is.
I would take you back – I don't know if we've talked Dan but I'm sure you've heard Steve and others and some of the materials we've put out.
I love looking at what the team's accomplished in the Williston Basin and we're drilling and completing 21 000 foot wells 22 000 foot wells there today for $5 million including facilities.
And those wells are virtually identical to the types of wells that we'll be drilling in STACK.
So when we get to development mode I wouldn't bet against team Newfield.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Fantastic.
Thanks for the update guys and congrats again on the quarter.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thank you.
We'll go next to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Advisors.
Please go ahead.
Morning guys.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning.
The fourth quarter guidance of 74 000 barrels equivalent a day what's the oil percentage expected in that? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Gary will flip the page in the book here for you.
Okay.
I think it's about 36% somewhere thereabouts.
Okay.
Yeah.
And so you are on trend still to get to the 40% oil percentage in 2016 so that kind of continued to pick up into next year.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I don't know if you heard the earlier response David...
Yeah.
Basically (36:18) President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> ...the small variations quarter-to-quarter that's just noise.
I think the trajectory is all positive and we're really pleased with the performance against the type curve.
So I think we're all set there it will just be a question of pace.
Yeah.
We've seen other operators – you're meeting or exceeding your oil volumes and then getting an uplift of incremental gas and NGLs that are kind of gratis or gravy on your economics.
And do you expect that to continue as you look forward or is that just – or do you still get to the same mix of 400 000 barrels of oil and 950 000 barrels equivalent from an EUR standpoint? Just trying to get an idea of – oil's making it but does gas and NGL even beat more and give you some more juice? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Well I think that the politest answer I can give today is let us accumulate some more time on the wells that we've released today.
We're going to add additional wells in the course of the fourth quarter.
So we'll go into next year with 100 wells in our dataset.
So the dataset is growing at a pretty rapid pace in that regard.
Clearly with the uplift that you're seeing on the early returns on these wells my expectation is it will ultimately translate to an uptick in EUR.
So you will see improvement across the product mix: oil NGLs and gas.
And then I think talking to Steve last night there was some downtime in the Eagle Ford in the quarter and then you had higher ethane in the Williston that brought your NGL realizations down.
How does that flow forward into the fourth quarter? The NGLs that we saw increased in the Williston Basin.
We'll – we're anticipating that it will flow into 2016.
Okay.
So that keeps going.
Thank you.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> It's all about capture up there.
Thanks guys.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yep.
Thank you.
And we have time for one last question and we can take that from Josh Silverstein with Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.
Inc.</span></strong> Thanks.
Morning guys.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hey Josh.
Inc.</span></strong> You mentioned some of this in your comments with the transportation moving from the truck to pipe increasing some of the netbacks by about $2 per barrel.
I was hoping you guys could provide whether it's in terms of BOE or percentage the margin uplift you guys are anticipating seeing as we flow through next year as the Anadarko Basin becomes the majority of the domestic volumes? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think probably the best answer rather than me making it up on the fly is just to tell you that let us complete the plan.
We'll get the details of the plan and when we release all that information you'll have all of that data in there.
I mean I think trend lines quarter to quarter that you've got in 2015 probably give you pretty good visibility.
We're not going to change dramatically from one quarter to the next but small percentage changes can be driven by the things I referenced earlier in the call: pad drilling locations all kinds of different things that play into that.
Inc.</span></strong> Got it.
And if you guys were in that the $900 million maintenance mode where would that low 50-ish percentage of the Anadarko Basin flow through to 4Q 2016? Is it well over 60% or is it just kind of a gradual step-up each quarter? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I'm not sure I followed the questioning.
So let me ask you to go ahead and repeat.
Inc.</span></strong> So the Anadarko Basin production has obviously increased as a percentage of total domestic volumes.
I was just curious if – it sounds like upwards of 90% of the spent is going to go into that Basin while the others...
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Inc.</span></strong> ...
somewhat decline.
Where does that kind of percentage go to looking out a year? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
So I'll stick to the same comment.
We'll give you the 2016 absolute figures when we come out in February with that data.
The trend line I think you're on to a good line of reasoning.
I think the Anadarko is going to become a more dominant part of the portfolio.
We mentioned in the call that we've gone past 50% and clearly the margins are improving there.
So Anadarko Basin the economic draw the gravitational pull we've been talking about the last two years or three years just continues to get stronger and stronger.
And it will translate to materially improved margins 2016 forward.
We kind of like that.
Inc.</span></strong> (40:50) President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Okay.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> Well I guess think that was the last call.
So we'll go ahead and thank everybody for tuning in this morning.
Appreciate the questions.
Look forward to updating you on the full year 2015 results and our 2016 plan going forward.
And again thanks for your interest and investment in Newfield.
Have a good day.
And this does conclude today's program.
Thanks for your participation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a great day.
