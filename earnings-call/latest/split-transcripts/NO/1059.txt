Good morning and welcome to the Noble Energy's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
Following today's presentation there will be opportunity to ask questions.
Please note today's event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh.
Please go ahead sir.
Thank you for joining us today.
This morning we issued our quarterly earnings release and new guidance for the remainder of the year.
Following another strong quarter we have again raised our full year volume outlook for Noble Energy while keeping our capital program consistent with prior expectations.
Our new guidance and comments today also incorporate an outlook for these new Texas assets which we're excited to share following the closing of the Rosetta Resources acquisition in late July.
We also posted to our website a number of supplemental slides for this call which you'll find helpful as we talk through our prepared remarks.
Later this morning our 10-Q will be available as well.
Following prepared comments from Dave Stover Chairman President and CEO; and Gary Willingham Executive VP of Operations we'll open the call for questions and complete in about an hour.
We ask that participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up.
Management members joining for the Q&amp;A session are Ken Fisher Executive VP and CFO; Susan Cunningham Executive VP Exploration and New Ventures; and Keith Elliott Senior VP Eastern Med.
I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.
You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.
With that I'll turn the call over to Dave.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thanks Brad.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us.
I want to share with you why I continue to have great confidence in our business and strategy.
While these are challenging times in our industry it does not diminish the fact that Noble Energy has exceptional assets as well as the financial strength and operational excellence to realize their potential.
Our positive momentum including the recent closing of the Rosetta acquisition gives us great optimism for the future as we continue to execute on our strategy of driving value from a high-quality diversified portfolio that provides investment choices.
Our core competitive advantages continue to be focused in U.S.
onshore unconventional development combined with material offshore explorations and proven major projects execution.
Additionally we have the financial strength to navigate through a volatile market and take advantage of opportunities.
All oil and natural gas companies are facing choppy seas right now but I believe investors are very well-positioned with Noble Energy.
We continue to effectively manage the things that are within our control and position the business for long-term value creation.
Our diversified portfolio underpinned strong performance in the second quarter.
Volumes again exceeded expectations and meaningful reductions are being realized on both capital and operating costs.
Sales volumes were nearly 300 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day even with the impact of scheduled facility maintenance in both the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa.
For the second time this year we've raised our Noble Energy legacy volume outlook for the full year.
This is a result of our flexibility to reallocate capital throughout the year as we continue to see efficiency improvements in the DJ Basin program.
Second quarter capital expenditures declined sequentially to under $800 million and we remain on track to meet our original $2.9 billion capital forecast.
Our capital is trending lower quarterly for the year as we manage the cash flow in the second half of the year.
I'm also extremely pleased with our progress in reducing cash cost specifically in the onshore business where lease operating expense was reduced to approximately $4 per barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter.
This is down more than 20% from the first quarter.
Total lease operating expense per barrel of oil equivalent for Noble Energy is now back to pre-2010 level reflecting our portfolio changes and an intense focus on reducing controllable costs.
Operational execution continues to be an area of keen focus as we look to maximize long-term profitability with a number of a major accomplishments achieved during the second quarter.
This included onshore horizontal production growth of 45% versus the same quarter of last year and record low drilling times in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale.
Drilled and completed costs all in are trending below targeted well costs in both plays.
In our offshore business the Ashdod compression project in Israel has been completed increasing our peak deliverability and at the same time pipeline installation and top site facility modifications are progressing as planned on Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico.
First production from these fields is expected in the fourth quarter and around the end of the year respectively.
On the offshore drilling side we have three rigs currently operating: one progressing our Gunflint development and two drilling material exploration wells including prospects offshore of the Falkland Islands and Cameroon.
So from an execution standpoint I am pleased with how our business is operating.
The acquisition of Rosetta enhances and further diversifies our onshore unconventional portfolio by adding two premier low-cost operating assets.
Strong underlying asset performance results from other operators in and around our acreage as well as recent M&amp;A activity in these basins continues to affirm the long-term value of our transaction.
It was the right opportunity at the right time for Noble Energy.
These high-quality assets provide prolific and low-cost production in the Eagle Ford with running room and a deep inventory of liquids-rich opportunities in the emerging Delaware Basin.
Without question these new areas will have a substantial impact to Noble Energy.
When you think about more than 60 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production at least 1 800 identifiable locations and around 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent potential that's a very sizable business that can grow materially into the future.
We've hit the ground running and we're already seeing more value potential than we originally assumed.
Combined our Texas assets will deliver 15% compound annual growth for several years within the operating cash flows of this business.
As such we aren't pulling capital away from any of our other strong return opportunities which is one reason this investment was so unique.
As shown on slide 3 we now have sizable position in four of the premier U.S.
unconventional plays.
This provides substantial flexibility in our future capital allocation and the ability to accelerate activity when appropriate.
We will also realize about $40 million per year in G&amp;A synergies while taking advantage of Noble's lower cost of capital.
Let me now hand it over to Gary to walk through an operations update.
Thanks Dave.
I'd like to start off by sharing my thoughts on why the Rosetta acquisition was such a great move for Noble Energy.
Our technical knowledge of these basins was built over the last several years as our business development and new venture teams have set all of the best basins in the U.S.
From this work two things became apparent.
First we needed to focus our existing onshore U.S.
portfolio on the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale which consistently rank among the top basins.
This caused us to exit a number of other plays over the last few years.
Second we wanted to be ready to further enhance our portfolio by capturing opportunities in other competitive basins when they became available.
The Eagle Ford and Delaware basins are both top-tier plays and we've now obtained premier positions in some of the best parts of each.
Over the last few years we have dramatically improved performance in the DJ Basin and then transferred and accelerated those learnings in the Marcellus.
With the addition of the Eagle Ford and Delaware positions we are confident that our operational expertise will again unlock incremental value that otherwise would not have been delivered.
Our acquisition model applied value almost entirely to the existing production the Lower Eagle Ford inventory and the Upper Wolfcamp potential in the Delaware.
We see a lot of room to increase value further from multi-zone development in both plays refrac potential and additional locations that are not assumed in our current counts.
The high quality nature of our Eagle Ford asset is demonstrated on slide 5.
The map illustrates estimated recoveries per lateral foot in the basin.
You can see the outline of our acreage the largest being a core position in Northern Webb County where we will focus our Eagle Ford activity over the next few years.
This is a sweet spot of some of the most productive rock in the play with tremendous resource recoveries ranging between 1 million and 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per well based on a 5 000-foot lateral.
We have highlighted in the table our current assumptions including inventory counts based on current strip pricing and assumed spacing estimated ultimate recoveries and average well costs.
Highlighted on slide 6 is the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve for South Gates Ranch represented by the blue line.
This is an increase of 25% from Rosetta's prior type curve shown in red.
The green line is the average of two recent wells which are outpacing even our increased type curve by another 20%.
We've provided our detailed Eagle Ford activity plans on slide 7 showing accelerating well activity through at least 2018.
Our plan is to focus on the lower Eagle Ford for the next few years increasing well lateral length to an average of around 7 000 feet.
We are currently drilling our first Eagle Ford well and have already implemented improvements that have materially increased footage drilled per day.
Moving over to the Permian this is an area where we see tremendous value and upside as we accelerate appraisal activities and move quickly to development mode.
The Delaware is emerging as a world-class basin with multi-zone potential.
Development plans will include multi-well pad drilling centralized production facilities and the potential for long laterals none of which were being done in these assets.
We will rapidly incorporate and leverage learnings from the DJ Basin and the Marcellus as we plan the long-term development of the basin.
Our focus in the Permian will be on the Delaware Basin position which is a contiguous 45 000 net acres.
In the DJ Basin we've already experienced the significant value uplift that a large-scale systematic development approach can bring in terms of maximizing recoveries lowering capital and operating costs and minimizing the above ground impacts.
On slide 8 we have shown how this acreage compares to our DJ Basin East Pony IDP area in terms of size.
And so this is clearly a material position for Noble.
We've already identified over 1 200 gross locations based on current strip prices for development with 70% of these in the Wolfcamp A and 3rd Bone Spring and the remainder in Lower Wolfcamp zones.
Highlighted on slide 9 our recent Noble wells and those from other operators in and around our acreage.
For the Noble wells the peak 30-day average production rate from a normalized 5 000-foot lateral is nearly 1 300 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a two-stream basis and more than 70% of this production is crude oil.
These production rigs are impressive and consistent with other operator results in the area.
Similar to what we have shown for the Eagle Ford we have provided our 700 000 barrel of oil equivalent type curve again for a 5 000-foot lateral on slide 10.
This type curve is up 30% from Rosetta's previous type curve.
Recent well performance represented by the 14 wells in the green line gives us a lot of confidence in the potential of these assets.
We've also highlighted on this slide some of the anticipated operating efficiencies that Noble Energy will bring to these assets.
You can see the substantial reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot that we have driven in the DJ Basin and Marcellus versus historical performance in these areas.
Combining Noble's drilling expertise and knowledge of multi-zone developments with Rosetta's skill set and knowledge will no doubt deliver substantial operational improvements in the Delaware.
On slide 11 we have provided our detailed plans for acceleration in the Permian resulting in 70 wells drilled in 2018 and anticipating continued activity growth beyond that.
Under the current plan capital investment in the Delaware is essentially equivalent to the Eagle Ford beginning next year and exceeds the Eagle Ford beginning in 2018 with even earlier acceleration of the Delaware possible as our plans continue to evolve.
Our outlook for the combined sector's assets has production growing to more than 100 000 barrels equivalent per day in 2018 as shown on slide 12.
We estimate substantial annual free cash flow at the end of our forecasted period which would only provide additional investment flexibility.
I'll now transition to the DJ Basin where both our underlying operational performance and the infrastructure capacity continue to improve.
Spud-to-rig release time averaged just over six days in the quarter for a standard-length lateral.
Last quarter it was seven days which was already below our budgeted assumption for 2015.
Dave mentioned well costs are trending under our target for the year.
Second half 2015 all-in well costs including drilling completion and allocated facilities are expected to be $3.5 million in Wells Ranch and $3.9 million in East Pony.
These are both $300 000 below our budget assumptions.
In addition when you normalize our long lateral well costs back to a normal-length equivalent well we are slightly below $3 million for these more capital-efficient wells and roughly 60% of our drilling in the second half of this year will be extended laterals.
With current rig efficiencies and four rigs for the rest of the year we expect to drill a total of 240 equivalent wells in 2015 compared to our original budget expectation of about 200 with the same number of rigs.
That's an amazing increase in performance and a key contributor to our 2015 production uplift.
On the completion side we continue to optimize stage lengths proppant loads and fluid types across our IDPs.
Most recently we've seen very strong performance utilizing slickwater in East Pony with the majority of these wells outperforming similar hybrid gel completions nearby.
Our success in growth in East Pony has been tremendous.
Net production in the East Pony IDP is now approximately 25 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day up 100% from this time a year ago.
And as a reminder more than 75% of East Pony volumes are oil.
At the end of the second quarter third-party infrastructure in Greater Wattenberg got a much-needed boost with the start-up of DCP's Lucerne-2 gas processing plant which is ramping the full capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day.
The addition of Lucerne-2 is increasing third-party gas capacity on the DCP system by a third to a total of 800 million cubic feet per day.
Now earlier this year in certain parts of the field line pressures averaged north of 250 psi which created a tough producing environment for many of the legacy vertical and horizontal wells.
Since Lucerne-2 start-up we've seen line pressures reduced by as much as 50 to 70 psi in the early part of July.
And that should be even greater as the plant reaches full capacity.
Volumes through July averaged more than 110 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with peak days greater than 115 000 per day.
Additional infrastructure projects in the basin continue to progress on schedule as well including the Grand Parkway low pressure gathering loop.
The combination of all of these projects position the basin well exiting 2015 and into 2016.
And while we remain guarded in our production guidance until consistent midstream performance is seen the early look is certainly very positive.
Finally in the Marcellus Shale our operations continue to improve.
Our drilling teams are performing extremely well and we drilled our longest lateral ever as a company in the second quarter nearly 14 000-foot horizontally.
In addition we're looking forward to production results from our first Utica well before the end of the year.
Given the price environment we're further reducing drilling activity in the basin in alignment with our joint venture partner.
In the middle part of the third quarter operated horizontal drilling will be reduced to zero rigs for the remainder of the year.
And on the dry gas non-operated side we anticipate going from two horizontal rigs to zero early in the fourth quarter.
These shifts in drilling do not impact our completion schedule for the remainder of 2015 and we are working with our partner on the right level of investment for 2016 with both companies focused on a cash-neutral program for the JV next year.
Let me now hand it back to Dave.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thanks Gary.
I want to spend a few minutes on the progress on the regulatory front in Israel and our upgraded 2015 outlook before opening for questions.
Over the last several months we've worked diligently with the government on establishing a regulatory framework to provide necessary certainty for future investments.
The product is a comprehensive framework that addresses the needs and interest of all parties including Noble Energy the government and citizens of Israel and its neighbors who can all benefit from these abundant gas resources.
Both the Prime Minister's Office and the Minister of Energy have endorsed the framework and are working to achieve final approval.
For Noble Energy this framework should provide certainty around regulatory and fiscal matters necessary to support future investments in the expansion of Tamar and the first phase of development at Leviathan.
For Israel it provides price transparency and market competition.
These projects can develop additional gas supplies within the country and bring the financial and geopolitical benefits of regional exports.
We continue to engage with future export customers in the region on the potential to deliver both Israeli and Cypriot gas to market.
The opportunity for expansion of natural gas used in Israel and the demand for natural gas in the region remain strong.
I look forward to unlocking tremendous unrecognized value in Noble as these projects come together.
Company-wise there are a number of positive catalysts in the second half of the year which provides us near- and long-term benefits.
We are encouraged that production capacity in the DJ Basin will continue to respond positively as we benefit from important infrastructure expansions while we focus on long laterals and additional completion learnings through the remainder of the year.
As Gary mentioned the integration of the Rosetta assets was going very well.
With a strong second quarter where volumes were higher and costs lower than expected these assets are off to a great start and complementary to Noble's overall performance.
Offshore two new fields are anticipated to add 20 000 barrels equivalent per day by the end of the year in the Gulf of Mexico.
In addition we will have results on two material exploration prospects this quarter including 250 million-barrel-plus Humpback prospect in the Falkland Islands and 100 million barrels plus Cheetah prospect in Cameroon.
Success in either of these wells or with our Rhea well in the Falkland later this year would de-risk additional exploration potential provide new development opportunity and add significant value for Noble Energy.
As mentioned earlier we are raising our previous full year 2015 volume guidance.
I'm pleased that we can see this amount of increase while holding full year capital flat to original plan and maintaining flexibility in our onshore activity should conditions and cash flow outlook change.
We've also provided new quarterly guidance for the remainder of the year which includes the integration of the Eagle Ford and Permian assets.
Base guidance reflects the quarterly trend of lower capital and operating cost through the remainder of the year while underlying volumes growth.
Yes these are tough times but we are well positioned with exceptional assets and strong operating and financial capacity to navigate through these challenges no matter the duration.
We've been very thoughtful in our decision processes throughout the year as we continue to maintain strong capital discipline and manage the cash flow in the second half of the year.
I am convinced Noble Energy's future is very bright.
At this time we would like to go ahead and open the call to questions.
We'll now begin the question-and-answer session.
The first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thank you.
Good morning everybody.
Dave I wonder if I could squeeze a couple in.
My first one is really just a point of clarification I think on one of Gary's comments relating to cash I guess breakeven or neutrality.
Obviously you're not there yet and you've got a bunch of start-ups in 2016 in the deepwater I guess back-end of this year and 2016.
So what should we think in terms of you getting to cash breakeven? Is that an objective for management? Or do you expect to continue spending for the time being? And I've got a follow-up please.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Doug when you look at how we're managing the cash flow if you look how that plays out this year and especially when you – I refer you to the guidance we laid out for third and fourth quarter.
You see our capital spend continues to come down dramatically as we enter the fourth quarter.
A big part of that is the roll-off if you will of the capital spending on some of those Gulf of Mexico projects.
We'll actually have Dantzler on here by middle of the fourth quarter and – or I mean Big Bend by middle of the fourth quarter and Dantzler by the end of the year.
So you'll have two of the three big projects and their capital spend actually rolling off.
So we expect to be – even in this $50 to $60 world we expect to be managing the cash flow here by the end of the year and that will set us up very nicely for next year.
That's what I was hoping to hear.
Thanks Dave.
My follow-up is I'm sure there's going to be a ton of questions on Rosetta.
So I'm going to go to a different one if I may which is the Marcellus decision to take rigs away there.
I'm just wondering if you could tell us what the underlying decline rate is going to look like in the Marcellus with no rigs running.
And I'll let someone else take the other ones.
Thanks.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yes.
Doug I think the real decision there is that it's not the time to be continuing to drill wells in the Marcellus with the outlook on gas price till we see that change.
That being said with some of the completion inventory and some of the completion activity we'll still be ramping up in the second half of this year.
And I think we'll still be flat to up some next year with that inventory even with the drilling activity.
I think the real impact of the drilling activity is when you start to look at the late 2016 and into 2017 timeframe.
And then that will be dependent on – when we ramp back up will be dependent on our outlook for gas price.
So we shouldn't confuse no drilling rigs with no completion activity is that what you're basically saying? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Right.
Right.
Got it.
Okay.
Thanks very much Dave.
Our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons &amp; Company.
Good morning guys.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Morning Dave.
Real quickly following up on the CapEx just a little bit for 2016.
If I look at your run rate in Q4 can I assume that that's kind of the run rate you'll be doing on a quarterly basis going forward plus incrementals associated with Delaware and Eagle Ford kind of round numbers? And I know you don't want to commit to a number but put you down year-over-year maybe around the 2.8 type number? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah Dave.
I think when we look at 2016 and you're right it's too early to get too far ahead of ourselves but when you at it and you look at how we're finishing this year and how we're set up for next year we've got a lot of flexibility.
I mean when I sit here and look at 2016 managing the cash flow we can be down significantly in capital and still realize low to mid-single-digit production growth.
So I think that positions us extremely well and that flexibility allows us to adapt to a changing environment and a changing cash flow environment to be ready to accelerate when it makes sense and to be able to have the flexibility to hold back if that makes sense but still have a growing business.
Okay.
I appreciate that color.
And then maybe one more just flipping over to the Delaware where you guys outlined your cost on an annual basis in the wells obviously when I look at 2016 if I just did the math on wells versus capital it would assume a pretty high cost that comes down dramatically by 2018 to about $5.4 million a well.
I assume 2016 is incorporating upfront infrastructure associated with kind of the IDPs.
And maybe if that's the case could you talk to us a little bit about the capital or cash flow savings benefits you see from IDPs? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah Dave.
We wanted to make sure we laid out for all of the Rosetta assets what our plan looks like for the next three years.
So I'd take a hard look at all that.
I'll have Gary add some color to some of this.
But I'll start with that – when you look at 2016 and even the future years on some of the Delaware piece you've got a mix of operated and non-operated spend in there and I think we asterisked that.
I think you also have some facility capital upfront as you put in some of this.
You brought up the point of the IDPs and I think – and we showed kind of the overlay how that Delaware Basin acreage compares to for example an East Pony acreage position up there.
I think it sets up extremely well for being able to apply the IDP concept in some that value that that will bring over time.
But let me have Gary just talk a little bit more.
Yeah Dave.
That's right.
I mean it's largely driven by fluctuations that we forecast in non-op activity in addition to some upfront infrastructure costs.
And Dave's right.
Our experience in the DJ Basin has clearly shown that pre-investing in infrastructure in these areas certainly pays off in the long run.
Every time we look at our performance in the DJ we see 25% to 30% uplift in the present value of those projects by our IDP-type concept in the integrated infrastructures.
So we do have some pretty investment in there for that as well.
Okay.
I really appreciate that added color.
Thank you guys and great work.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks Dave.
Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Thanks.
Maybe if I can follow up on capital one more time.
As you think about the run rate into 2016 and the priority this outline up to this point if commodity prices were to be lower or higher can you talk a little bit about how you would prioritize either further reduction in capital? Or if the commodity price were a little bit higher where we should expect to see additional acceleration or capital increase? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think we've added some more flexibility and diversity when you look at our mix of onshore assets now.
I think between the Marcellus we've talked about our thinking about that going into the year.
On the DJ we'll continue to see the impact of the Lucerne-2 plant coming up.
We'll see the line-looping system later this year so I'll give some more insight on how we want to play off capital and match capital with capacity going into next year.
And then in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford we've laid out our base plan.
I'd say all of those we got the flexibility to adapt and adjust if it makes sense when you look at the commodity outlook.
Our big offshore projects the only one really we'll still have in play next year we'll be finishing Gunflint.
The majority of that investment will be done by this year.
We'll have Gunflint on line by middle of next year.
We finished the compression project at Ashdod this year so the next investment in Israel will be dependent on this framework coming together.
So I think we're in real good place there on the exploration front.
We'll have our rig in the Gulf of Mexico focused on appraisal and exploration next year.
But overall we're well positioned to bring capital down continue to follow the trend that we've got into the fourth quarter this year and then make sure we're managing to the outlook that we see.
Inc.</span></strong> And is there explicit commodity price implicit in the guidance for the Delaware and Eagle Ford programs? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think what we've laid out is implicit as kind of the strip price we've been seeing - Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> ...here recently.
So that's in that 50 to 60-some range over the next year or two.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Thanks.
And then maybe if I can ask one on the revisions to the type curve you talked about a few of the things that you're doing differently but can maybe - President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Inc.</span></strong> ...
they've been impressive obviously particularly in a relatively short period of time.
Can you talk a little bit about the primary drivers of the revisions up to this point changes that you've made and maybe the types of wells that we're drilling? I know there's some in lateral length and maybe even what you're seeing on the most recent performance that's still exceeding the revised type curves? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I'll let Gary expand on it but really it comes down to just the recent well performance.
Not only our recent well performance but recent well performance in the basin for example in the Delaware.
And then in the Eagle Ford we have history especially as you move into South Gates Ranch from some wells that were drilled previously and then the more recent wells.
So you have a nice database in both areas.
Gary? Yeah Ryan.
First off as I mentioned lateral length those curves are normalized to a 5 000-foot lateral.
So even though we're drilling longer and longer laterals in the area that's not driving the type curve.
Dave's right.
It's really two things: It's moving more south into the Gates Ranch area which is a much more prolific area and then it's just continuing to improve on the completion designs.
Very similar to what we've done in the DJ Basin and the Marcellus with reduced stage and cluster spacing and also starting to increase our sand loadings up to 2 000 pounds in some cases.
So a lot of the same types of things we've done in the other areas just bringing them to the Eagle Ford and soon to be the Permian as well.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Thanks.
I'll leave it there.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks Ryan.
Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with RBC.
Hey guys.
Just wanted to get a little bit more color on Israel.
When you guys expect to see a vote and I guess a final approval do you have a rough timeframe for the new regulatory framework? And then additionally if that occurs when will you guys start spending capital there? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Leo I mean we're watching it as everybody is as the government kind of gone through the public process and they're in the process of working to bring that framework to final resolution final approval.
I think we're both committed and still remain committed to seeing this done by the end of the summer.
But I'll say the timing is important on this but the actual lasting and sustainable framework and the nature of the framework and having a framework that allows us to move forward with investment it is really the most important element.
I think what's very encouraging so far is that – and think back about this.
When you go back to over the last year what's been accomplished I mean the progress on getting to a framework has been nothing short of a tremendous effort on all parties on party of the government that's committed to doing this and on our team and our partners that have worked so hard to bring that to bear.
I mean a complete comprehensive framework that sets up the ability to go forward with confidence and investment is a big step.
Another big step has been the commitment and support of the Prime Minister's Office and the Energy Ministry to make this happen.
So I think when you look at it the step of getting the framework to where it is and now the recognition and understanding of how important this is not only to the country but to the region has just been tremendous.
That's helpful color.
And I guess just shifting gears over to the exploration front obviously you guys are drilling away at I guess Humpback in the Falkland and Cheetah as well.
Do you guys kind of have a rough probability of success on each of those two wells respectively? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I'll go through what we've kind of laid out on probabilities and then Susan can probably give you some more insight as to her thoughts on both of those wells.
And then also don't forget the Rhea prospect later this year which probably has a slightly higher probability.
I think on Humpback and Cheetah they're both in that 25% plus or minus 25% range; both interesting exciting prospects; both with a little different color.
In Humpback that's our first true exploration test on this huge acreage position down in the Falklands.
I mean you think about it you think about how our acreage position overlays the North Sea for example.
It's just our position down there in the Falkland that's about half of the North Sea.
That'll be really interesting to see what transpires here as we break out a new play but it's a new play in areas where there's been proven hydrocarbon discovery some fairly significant when you look at the whole scheme of things.
In Cameroon you know to me what's exciting there it's like Gulf of Mexico prospect on steroids as I've talked about it when you look at the shallow water depths and the high potential but let me turn it over to the real expert here.
Susan? New Ventures Frontier EHSR &amp; Business Innovation</span></strong> Thanks Dave.
Yeah Dave the 25% is about right plus or minus for the two prospects that are drilling right now and Rhea will be higher than that regardless of the outcome of Humpback.
What's great about Humpback is the follow-up.
It's over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent just in that immediate area if we have some encouragement there.
So it's pretty significant.
And Cheetah is only 10 miles offshore from the coast in Cameroon and it's in about 85 feet of water so it will be very quick and easy and cheap to tie in and to develop if it's successful.
All right.
Thanks guys.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thank you Leo.
Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Yes.
Good morning Dave and to the rest of your team there.
I was wondering if I could ask a bit about the Eagle Ford assets and your outlook there.
I think you mentioned in your prepared comments and also on the slides that your location count at the strip.
But as I look at these assets one of the things that set them apart is the NGL percentage.
The Street is a little more obscure when it comes to talking about NGLs.
Can you talk about what your current assumptions are there and what your outlook is especially in light of it's been kind of the – maybe it's take it on the chin hard here in 2015 and maybe what your thoughts are for an outlook and how that affects your appetite for those NGL-heavy assets? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think it's something you have to take a hard look at Charles.
I think as we've looked at it we've not assumed that NGL pricings are really going to change a lot this year.
I think as we look at it and visit with our marketing folks that probably into next year as you get more ships and so forth especially can move more propane and butane that just start to see some real alleviation of pressure there.
That being said you are close to the Gulf Coast and some of the Gulf Coast markets with the Eagle Ford volume so that's helpful.
But it's just part of the mix that we take into effect and account when we look at the economics of these.
And I'll say the economics of the Eagle Ford especially as you're hearing Gates Ranch and South Gates Ranch stack up with everything and anything even considering all those...
Got it.
So David I think I heard that you think there'll be some improvement of NGL prices in the 2016 2017 timeframe as you get more export capacity.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> That's what we're hopeful.
I think it's going to take something like that to really change that outlook.
Got it.
Thank you.
And then on the Delaware Basin can you talk about – the slide you put together with your results and energy results is really helpful.
And you really focus on the Wolfcamp A there but can you talk about what – you mentioned other zones.
Can you talk about what those other zones are going to be in rough order of what you think the prospectivity is? And what your timeline would be to test some of those other concepts? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I mean you're right Charles that we're focusing initially on the Wolfcamp A.
And I think within that you have to look at how do you most effectively drain that whole Wolfcamp A horizon.
I think there's opportunities to maybe even have multiple laterals not that we're counting on that in that Wolfcamp A that also start to pick up some of that 3rd Bone Spring drainage.
Got it.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> But I think those would be the two initial pieces.
And then you move down to kind of B and C as a longer term optionality that I don't doubt the industry will break out economically over time but we're not counting on it.
Got it.
So that kind of more extensive development of the Wolfcamp A that could get the 3rd Bone Spring that's something we could maybe start to see in 2016.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think as we get into 2016 2017 and also in 2018 where we kind of start to see the Delaware program really ramp up you'll start to draw in some of that horizon.
So we'll start to see some impact from that from – but really still what we've laid out as a plan is landing all our laterals into Wolfcamp A.
Got it.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Though we haven't specifically target landing a lateral in the Bone Springs yet in that program.
Okay.
Thank you Dave.
Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Thank you.
Good morning.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Morning Brian.
When you built your position in the DJ you followed your Patina acquisition with the U.S.
Exploration acquisition.
As you look to the Eagle Ford and Permian what's your ultimate goal in terms of the size of the position you're looking for and do you see additional opportunities that are front and center in this downturn to make that happen? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Brian I'll go back to what we've talked about since we announced the Rosetta acquisition.
One of the first keys to Rosetta was to be comfortable that in and of itself it had an enough size and growth within those assets that it wasn't dependent on another acquisition.
That said being in the neighborhood I think we'll continue to look at what's available out there and make sure we understand the value of different opportunities.
I'd say we have a strong solid balance sheet that gives us the ability and flexibility to be able to take advantage of opportunities if a great opportunity came around.
But that's not the focus of what we're doing now.
The focus of what we're doing now is on execution.
And I think you can see that showing up not only in what was delivered in the first half of the year but what were set up to deliver in the second half of the year and that's the same focus we're applying to the Rosetta assets.
That's a good tie-in to my follow-up which is on that execution point in the legacy assets the increased guidance that seem to reflect a lot of your outlook for a second-half uplift.
Can you just talk more specifically about the drivers of the increased production guidance between the Marcellus DJ or elsewhere? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Glad to Brian.
Actually we've been looking forward to this call for a period of time because we've been looking forward to getting to midyear here.
The exciting part for us is we put a plan in effect at the beginning of the year and we got in motion very very quickly.
And now we're benefiting from the results of delivering on that plan.
I'd say we're actually ahead of that plan and I think that's framed in what you look at for the outlook for the second half of the year.
When you go back to what we started the year we ramped down and pushed down the Marcellus program pretty quickly.
We very quickly reduced activity levels in the DJ from 10 rigs to 4.
We level-loaded and kind of slowed down some of our completion activity so we could get Lucerne-2 in place.
As a result of how things have moved through the year we actually saw some of the Marcellus planned capital come down.
We actually moved some of that capital to the DJ.
Part of that was a reflection on just the continued improvement on efficiency.
We've talked before about those four rigs are drilling about 70% of the total lateral footage that we did with 10 rigs.
So that's all enabled us to where the real driver in the second half of the year and the biggest driver in that increased guidance is the outlook on this activity and performance in the DJ.
Got it.
And that's partly as you say on the well productivity front but also on just unlocking midstream bottlenecks.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think it all comes together and Gary may have some more to add on his thoughts there.
Yeah.
I think it's unlocking the midstream bottlenecks which we had some increase in there in the original budget but we've added a bit more based on the early results we're seeing.
It's partly the underlying improvement and the completions.
We mentioned the phenomenal success that we've seen recently in East Pony and then it's just a greater number of wells coming online throughout the year as we've continued to drive down the drilling times.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Thank you.
Gary you confirmed that the increase in the type curves at Gates Ranch and Eagle Ford were driven a lot by the cluster spacing and the sand loadings.
I know overall costs have come down but on today's costs can you quantify for every 30% or the 25% to 30% increase in EURs what the associated increase in cost is percentage-wise for doing the cluster spacing in the greater proppant loading? Yeah Bob.
I think it's probably on the 10% range.
But at the same time I think we've got greater efficiencies that are going to offset quite a bit of that.
I think when you look at what we're seeing already on the drilling side since we've closed the deal we have been able on these first couple of wells to significantly improve the drilling times especially through the lateral length.
And I think at the end of the day we're going to be able to take probably conservatively a couple of days off of the average drill time on the Eagle Ford well.
So certainly more stages or more cluster spacing and greater sand loadings adds to the cost but we see some efficiencies offsetting that.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Okay.
And then a second question just on refracs.
In the Marcellus I know you're laying down all your rigs this year but will you continue to test refracs in the Marcellus and what have you seen there? And then in the Eagle Ford you mentioned some of the upside being potential for refracs.
What gives you confidence that refracs can be successful in that play? Yeah.
It's a combination really of refrac and in some cases adding perfs or tightening up those cluster spacing just like we're doing on the new completion.
So we may have a few more scheduled in the Marcellus this year.
I don't think it's going to be a significant number but the early results we've seen on the ones we've done have been very encouraging initial rates back up to the original initial rates in many cases.
I think what gives us the same level of confidence in the Eagle Ford is on those older completions.
Very much kind of a similar story to the Marcellus much wider stage spacing fewer perf clusters and so it's an opportunity to go in and not only add perfs but improve the completion designs as well.
So I think we'll see some nice uplift there as well.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> When do you plan to do your first refrac in Eagle Ford? Oh I don't know we've got one on the schedule yet.
We may try a couple before year-end but I would suspect 2016 will be more of a test.
Inc.
(Broker)</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Company.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Yes.
Good morning.
Just want to quickly confirm that your Marcellus capital spending for this year is still going to be maintained at that $700 million level.
And does the DJ Basin also staying at $1.1 billion given the additional wells that you talked about adding into the program? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah Michael.
I think on the Marcellus it's probably just a hair under that which permits the DJ maybe a being a hair above that.
So I think plus or minus $100 million on either of those.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
I got it.
And then just one corporately can you just talk about how comfortable you are with your current hedge book and discuss how you're going to approach adding on more protection given the volatility? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I'll make a few comments and then Ken Fisher can add to that because he watches that continuously.
Drags me into more meetings than I can believe on that.
But no we're taking a hard look at that all the time.
I mean we do meet on that probably every couple of weeks to look at what makes sense; how is the market move; how are we positioned for not just the current year but the following two years as we look at both our global oil mix and our domestic gas mix.
It's also a time period where we reflect and remind ourselves how appreciative we are of having our Israel gas contribution also that's kind of a natural hedge additional hedge if you will.
But we continue to look for periods especially in any market upswings which we'd like to see more of on a commodity basis.
But as we get into some market upswings how do we layer in some positions as we go forward? Our philosophy and objective has been to hedge up to 50% on those different streams for managing cash flow.
I think with our legacy position on oil we were about 30% for next year.
And I think on gas it was 25% to 28% somewhere in that range.
But I'll let Ken add up a little more color.
I mean as Dave said the program has been very successful through time ensuring that we cut off the tail risk.
So if you look at it historically we had big positive settlements in 2009 in the global financial crisis and then we'll have about $750 million in settlement this year.
We're as Dave mentioned about 30% hedged on oil; 25% hedged on gas going into next year.
We don't typically make big moves all at one time but average in so we'll continue to look at that.
And then we picked up the Rosetta hedge book as well and they're pretty well hedged as well about 35% for oil and 45% on gas production next year.
So all in all our competitive position on the hedge book is strong and it's a shock absorber that allows us to realize those gains as we bring down the capital plan for the current investment environment and achieve cash flow neutrality.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thanks very much.
Our next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global.
Hey guys.
Good morning.
Just hoping to get a little bit more color on the production profile in the DJ.
You dropped sequentially Q1 to Q2 but the July numbers look good.
And with the midstream constraints abating and efficiency gains become more apparent just hoping just talk about what the progression could look like here in the second half and then maybe just initial thoughts going into 2016 there.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I'll start with that Mike and then have Gary provide some more insights.
But yeah as Gary said in his notes in his dialogue earlier we've still remained pretty guarded as to what the full impact of this Lucerne-2 facility will be and then still what the line-loop will be later this year.
We're seeing some very good encouraging results.
I would say we expect volumes to be up from second quarter and third and fourth.
But I think it'll be nice to get this Lucerne-2 plant fully ramped up.
It's been down here for – not down but it's been impacted by the fact that they've had another facility planned maintenance that we still got a couple of weeks to see the full impact out there but we've been very pleased – very very pleased with what we've seen so far as that's ramped up.
And let me have Gary give you some more color on that.
Yeah.
Mike it's – 3Q and 4Q will definitely be up from 2Q in our guidance.
I'd second what Dave said.
We're being very guarded I would say at this point until we see more of a sustained performance.
The early look is very encouraging though and we've said we're north of 110 000 in July peak days greater than 115 000.
We've actually even seen a couple of days in the 120 000 range.
So that is all without Lucerne-2 running at full capacity yet and they haven't yet made it to the 200 million a day.
In the meantime as Dave mentioned they've had another facility down for some planned maintenance which took about 120 million a day out of the system capacity.
So that's part of the reason we're still being a bit conservative for now until we see more than just a couple of days with some decent rates through the system.
But I think from the early performance we're seeing line pressures down 50 psi to 75 psi across the field when they've got everything up and running very excited about what we're seeing.
I think we'll see some very nice numbers in the 3Q and 4Q there.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> And should really position us well as we exit the year.
And as we exit the year then the Grand Parkway starts up which provides even greater pressure relief and allows us even a better opportunity to get some of those legacy vertical volumes that have been so constrained over the last year-and-a-half into the plants.
Okay.
Great guys.
Good color.
And the follow-up is on the Eagle Ford.
If you look at the page 5 of your presentation here it does look like it's a pretty big delta in the lateral foot EURs and you talked about the kind of the sweet spot here in the Southern Gates Ranch area.
Maybe you could talk about the difference in returns between that acreage versus what you'd seize in the Upper Eagle Ford and what you've categorized as other Lower Eagle Ford.
And then as a follow-up to that just what the opportunity set is to ultimately see the number of gross locations increase in that kind of 600 Boe per lateral foot area.
Thank you.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I'll start with that.
But yeah I mean the Southern Gates Ranch Eagle Ford is the best of the best down there.
And you can see that even when you compare that across all the Eagle Ford acreage in the basin.
It is a pure sweet spot there.
And then when you compare it – so it's got the highest returns obviously.
I'd say everything that we've put on here has a decent return at a strip price especially when you look out into the future.
And the Upper Eagle Ford probably has the most challenge yet but I think we've got plenty of time before we get to those opportunities and I would expect we'll continue to improve the outlook on those by the time we get there beyond that 2018 time period.
But Gary did you have anything else? Yeah.
The South Gates Ranch is really is the area we're focusing in right now.
And when you look at how prolific those wells are I mean we see returns even in current strip price conditions of 75% to 100% returns in those areas so extremely strong economics.
The other Gates Ranch Lower Eagle Ford is obviously lower return than that given the EUR per lateral foot but still quite economic in this price environment.
And then as Dave mentioned the Upper Eagle Ford is the most challenged to-date but we do have awhile before we get there.
So hopefully we'll see a little help on those from prices improving in the meantime.
I'm confident we'll see help between now and then as we continue to refine the completion techniques in the areas where we're working in the meantime.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> And it's also worth noting that those locations referenced are only the locations that met an economic hurdle within the strip pricing environment.
So more opportunity beyond that if we get a little better in pricing environment at some point.
Okay.
Thanks a lot guys.
Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Société Générale.
Thanks.
Regarding the Delaware you've given an outline of how you're going to spend in terms of drilling completions and IDPs.
Would it be your best interest to own more infrastructure there so you don't have similar bottlenecks as you've had in the DJ with a third-party GTP or you'll just kind of run your business strategically like you did in the DJ and the Delaware? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
John I think when you look at it there's probably more infrastructure close to there in the basin than there was with what we started in the DJ.
That being said I think as we continue to look at how to create the most value both from integrating the subsurface with the surface facility piece and especially as we start getting further into an IDP concept we'll continue to look as to what makes sense from an overall facility structure.
But I think this is all about going in and having a totally integrated plan if you will that includes everything from how you produce it under the ground how you market it on the surface.
Okay.
Thanks Dave.
Last one for me is on the estimated dry hole cost for Humpback and Cheetah.
Susan could you give me that? New Ventures Frontier EHSR &amp; Business Innovation</span></strong> I don't have that.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think yeah.
If I remember right John on the Humpback it's plus or minus $100 million well I think.
Okay.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> And we've got what 35% and we're paying a little disproportionate higher percentage than that as far as what it took to get into the play.
On Cheetah it's a much cheaper well.
I think that's maybe in the $60 million-type range maybe on the high side on that.
But again on Humpback a big part of the cost is mobilization cost; also the allocated mobilization down there part of the rig sharing.
But I think those are order of magnitude and Susan will correct me if I'm wrong.
New Ventures Frontier EHSR &amp; Business Innovation</span></strong> Yeah that's correct.
Those are exactly the right order of magnitude.
Great.
Thank you.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks John.
Our next question comes from Philip Jungwirth with BMO.
Hey.
Good morning.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning Phil.
With the increase in Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp EURs is there a reason the 800 000 Boe a day production target by 2018 is unchanged with this improvement and recoveries already considered at the time of acquisition or is this just conservatism around giving multi-year growth target? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> We've matched up the growth with the capital spend and the activity level.
Again you've got flexibility here as conditions change and more information available to continue to update that.
But what we're doing right now is honoring the activity level and performance that we've input into the model to layout that three-year program along with the capital and cash flow that it provides.
So we'll continue to update that as we go.
We're just two weeks into this since we've closed but very excited about what we've got and where we're going.
Great.
And then with minimal capital being allocated to Marcellus in the second half and likely into 2016 and Noble having a deep portfolio of high return opportunities to allocate capital towards how strategic is this asset to the company? And do we need to consider anything about the JV structure impacting a potential divestiture should you choose that route? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think what we like about the Marcellus it is still the premier gas play in the U.S.
And when you look at the operational performance it's been outstanding out there but it's that operational performance across the industry that's contributed to this supply-demand imbalance.
I think when you look about at it though you love having a high-quality asset that's the premier asset in its mix in the portfolio and the optionality that that gives you for the future with the tremendous amount in running room.
The other thing that's I think very nice about our position and same with the JV is the fact that it's all essentially held by production out there.
So you have the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and make sure that you're making smart decisions on how you create the most value out of an asset like this.
Great.
Can you update us on your latest thoughts around the DJ Basin midstream MLP? I didn't see a mention in the presentation.
Just any color around specific assets invested capital or EBITDA would help.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yes.
On the DJ midstream we've worked and we've talked about it over the last couple of calls being in position and having the asset set up so that we've got flexibility on how we monetize and create value and leverage our midstream business up there if you will.
So we've got that in place.
I think we still have the flexibility to decide what we want to do with that.
When you look at that part of the business that we've kind of bracketed if you will if I remember right and Ken will straight me up if I misquote this but I think we've probably spent $500 million to $600 million invested in those assets so far.
Great.
Thanks a lot.
Our next question comes from Irene Haas with Wunderlich.
Inc.</span></strong> Hello.
This will be quick.
Question on Cyprus so a little more color on the timeline.
From this point on how many sort of months would we require to kind of get through the necessary steps to probably first production? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Cyprus it's still ways off in the future but it's a great opportunity.
We got a sizable discovery there.
I think the next steps in Cyprus are establishing a market which we're in discussions with potential customers on and then establishing someone to invest and put the equity and then laying the pipeline that's probably be required to establish and tie in that market.
So I think that's the sequence of things Irene.
Inc.</span></strong> So it's going to be a subsea pipeline or what are we thinking? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Definitely I think what you'd be thinking is a subsea line.
One of the possibilities is a line from Cyprus that would tie in to Egypt given the needs and the regional demand in that part of the world but that's why we got to get the customers in place first and also the equity owners in a pipeline.
I think when you think of things over there we've got three big projects over there between Tamar expansion Leviathan and Cyprus that are all pretty interesting in their own rights.
Inc.</span></strong> So great.
We're looking at two to three years possibly.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I'd say at least that period.
I think what we're thinking of on something like that the end-of-the-decade type of thing.
Keith do you have any additional thoughts on that? Yes.
So for first production looking at late 2019 mid-2020 kind of timeframe I think in terms of sequence forward really we're progressing the marketing efforts now as Dave described in building a project team and progressing toward a project FID that would put us in place for that kind of late late in the decade first production.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Thank you.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks Irene.
