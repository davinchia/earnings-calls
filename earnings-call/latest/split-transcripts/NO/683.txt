And your next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch from Sidoti.
Please proceed.
Ara you mentioned that opening new communities should be aided by your recent bond offering.
I had not really thought of your piece of community account growth as being capital constrained but more a factor of subs availability and sales capacity and other factors like that.
Can you just comment on what may potentially be the governor on getting the community count up over the next couple of years? Yes well frankly we were under invested for many many quarters.
So from that perspective capital was not a limiting governor.
It was just a matter of finding deals that met our hurdle rates.
But as you saw we are having more success in community acquisitions and getting to our investment goals.
But as we did that we thought it would be helpful to get a little bit of extra boost.
On top of that we have noticed -- which we anticipated but we noticed our newer acquisitions had a bigger mix of larger undeveloped sites rather than the smaller developed sites.
The smaller developed sites tend to take less capital.
The larger undeveloped ones take a little more capital.
In some cases we were able to utilize land bankers and therefore were able to purchase the lots from them on the basis that we prefer which is on a regular quarterly take down but that’s the not the case always.
So we just thought it would be a smart thing for us to do to get the excess capital right now.
And we also thought since there was a little bit of uncertainty in the market it would be a good and somewhat safer time to do a little land acquisition than when it was really growing steadily.
So -- in which cases land prices tend to go up a little irrationally sometimes.
So hopefully there is little more rationality in the market and we thought a better time to get in a little early before the market gets too much momentum on the recovery.
Great.
Thank you very much.
Well we’re pleased to report the quarter and some reasonable results.
Needless to say we’re anxious and look forward to even improve results going forward.
As we’ve kind of given a heads up unfortunately we’ll have lopsided quarterly revenues and earnings again.
But we’re continuing our path to get growth and we look forward to another good year of profitability.
Thanks so much.
