Good day everyone and welcome to the Noble Energy Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings Call.
Just a reminder today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks and introductions I will turn the conference over to Mr.
Brad Whitmarsh.
Please go ahead sir.
Thanks Debbie.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning.
We issued two news releases this is morning one covering the fourth quarter and our full-year earnings and the second one laying details on our 2016 plan.
We also posted to our website a number of supplemental slides for this call which you will find helpful as we talk through our prepared comments.
And later this morning our 10K will be filed with the SEC.
Following prepared comments from Dave Stover Chairman President and CEO; and Gary Willingham Executive Vice President of Operations we will open the call for question-and-answer session.
In order to meet our one hour timeframe we would ask that participants limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up question.
Additional management team available for Q&amp;A are Ken Fisher Executive Vice President and CFO; Susan Cunningham Executive Vice President of Exploration and New Ventures; and Keith Elliott SVP of our Eastern Mediterranean Assets.
I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.
You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.
With that I'll turn the call to Dave.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thanks Brad and good morning everyone.
For more than a decade now Noble Energy has planned and structured itself to succeed in any market environment.
I'm proud of what we've accomplished last year and I feel good about how we are positioned moving through this challenging time.
I'd like to start today's call with a few highlights wrapping up 2015 before focusing on our plans for 2016.
Fourth-quarter results show our continued operating momentum and focus on prudently managing within cash flow.
For the second straight quarter discretionary cash flow exceeded capital expenditures.
This reflects our asset quality our portfolio diversity and the ability of our organization to execute.
It's also a testament to the swift decisive actions we took to reduce spending and drive capital efficiency beginning more than a year ago.
Sales volumes for the quarter averaged a record 422 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which was above the high end of our increased guidance.
This was driven by accelerated project start ups in the Gulf of Mexico strong asset performance in Equatorial Guinea and Israel and continued improvement in completion design and infrastructure capacity in the DJ Basin.
Looking at our full-year 2015 accomplishments it was a year of outstanding operational and strategic execution under the backdrop of a difficult commodity environment.
We began last year targeting increased production capacity from our DJ Basin asset more recognition of the value in our Eastern Mediterranean project and alignment with our Marcellus partner for future capital spend.
By year's end we had accomplished each of these objectives while transforming our cost structure to match the current environment.
This was all achieved while realizing record safety performance across the business.
In addition we took advantage of an opportunity to expand our leading U.S.
unconventional portfolio with new top-tier positions in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin.
Initial operating results have exceeded expectations and highlight Noble's technical proficiency with new completion designs and drilling efficiencies.
Our major project execution capabilities were again evident in 2015.
We commenced production on both Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico while keeping Gunflint and the Alba compression project on plan for 2016 start up.
In Israel an approved and implemented natural gas regulatory framework gives us substantial momentum for future projects and the regulatory clarity necessary for new development to meet the region's growing demand for natural gas.
We ended 2015 with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent which was up slightly versus year-end 2014.
Excluding the impact of the Rosetta Resources merger and SEC commodity price changes we replaced 1.5 times 2015 production at a replacement cost of around $16 per barrel of oil equivalent.
Total organic capital for 2015 was under $2.9 dollars down approximately 40% from the previous year while unit operating costs were driven to their lowest point in eight years.
At the same time our average full-year reported sales volumes were up nearly 20% over the year before.
Part of the increase was the addition of the new Texas asset.
But our legacy volumes grew more than 10% by themselves.
I would now like to take a few moments to describe how we're moving forward in the current environment.
Noble Energy is an 84-year-old company.
We've been through many cycles before.
We believe our high-quality low-cost and diversified portfolio combined with capital discipline and tremendous investments flexibility provides the best formula for long term sustainable value creation.
Look at 2015 and 2016.
Without question we are achieving more while spending less.
As I look across the E&amp;P spectrum I believe Noble Energy is competitively advantaged for the future.
Protecting the balance sheet is fundamental in this environment.
That is why we are committed to managing total cash outflows within total cash inflows at the company level which started 2016 with $5 billion of liquidity including $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility.
This liquidity has already been further bolstered this year by approximately $200 million in cash proceeds from non-producing Eastern Mediterranean asset sales.
An additional $200 million of capacity was created through the recent dividend adjustment and debt refinancing.
We also intend to reduce leverage using additional cash flow from operations or portfolio proceeds beyond what has been captured to date.
Cash flow for the year is positively impacted by our hedging position which covers approximately 35% of our global oil and 25% of our U.S.
gas production.
As we survey investment opportunities against the outlook for commodity prices current returns do not justify prior activity levels.
We're again pulling back capital aggressively in 2016 and focusing only in those areas where long-term value opportunities make sense.
We have further reduced our capital program by nearly 50% year-over-year to $1.5 billion.
This will allow us to maintain financial strength and sustain underlying operating capabilities.
As part of our intense scrutiny on capital allocation our operating teams continue to improve capital efficiency while ensuring that each dollar spent is justified by the future value created.
This focus along with our ability to monetize additional asset gives us flexibility to adjust in a volatile price environment.
This year's program targets two-thirds of our capital to the U.S.
unconventional business and one-third to development and exploration offshore.
Gary will go through our detailed development programs in a moment but first I want to briefly cover our exploration plans and production outlook for the year.
Our organic exploration strategy has generated substantial value and created long-term cash flows for Noble over the years.
In 2016 we're focused on drilling two to three offshore wells while obtaining and interpreting seismic to open up future value opportunities.
We see this as a great environment to deepen our exploration inventory of high-quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry.
Now turning to production.
In 2016 we expect to deliver volumes of approximately 390 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This is up 10% on a full-year reported basis and essentially flat to the pro forma 2015 level.
From a quarterly standpoint we expect the first and third quarters to be higher volume than the second and fourth with the second half of the year generally equal to the first.
We've had a strong start to the year and I'm optimistic that we can drive new capital and operating efficiencies to outperform our goals.
In the slides for this conference call we've provided detailed full-year and first-quarter guidance.
First quarter volumes reflect downtime for the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham who will review recent performance and the 2016 program at the asset level.
Thanks Dave and good morning everyone.
As Dave noted from an efficiency and cost perspective the company is firing on all cylinders.
And I'm extremely pleased with the results we are delivering.
I believe there is a strong correlation between our record safety and exceptional operating performance.
I'll start our asset level discussion with the DJ Basin.
Fourth-quarter total production of 121 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day reflected continued improvement in completion performance and infrastructure development.
The DJ Basin was once again a big contributor to the company's lower operating costs and production outperformance.
Essentially all of the growth in the DJ versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015 has come from liquids with most of that oil.
The December start up of the Grand Parkway system further reduced line pressures to the lowest levels we can remember and should provide redundancy and improve through-put.
Noble's operated Keota plant in East Pony which came online mid-year 2015 is also running well supporting our activity in that area.
After drilling and completing horizontals in the DJ Basin for more than 5 years now our team is still driving step changes in drilling results and well performance.
Our full-year 2015 average drilling cost per lateral foot was down 40% from 2014.
And as well costs have been substantially reduced we've also enhanced production performance with optimized completion designs.
We continue to focus on slickwater as our standard frac fluid design which is consistently delivering lower costs and enhanced production per well.
The next step in completion innovation and capital efficiency is utilizing a completion design that will allow slickwater fracs to be pumped to the toe on long laterals and also with higher proppant concentrations.
Actual results on both hybrid gel and slickwater wells with higher proppant concentration are exhibiting better initial production and flatter declines compared to our historical jobs.
For 2016 we plan to operate two rigs for the full year focusing in the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas.
These are our highest value IDPs with strong oil contributions and existing infrastructure already in place.
Total capital allocation to the Basin this year is just under $600 million.
70% of the DJ Basin wells to be drilled in 2016 are planned to be extended reach many of which will be 9000 foot laterals in Wells Ranch.
We are targeting the drilling of 150 equivalent wells this year and expect to commence production on slightly more than 200 equivalents.
While these lower activity levels suggest that DJ production will be down somewhat from last year I'm optimistic that these new completion designs can help offset some of the potential declines.
Moving over to our Texas assets I'm pleased with our integration efforts in 2015 and believe we're making good progress in optimizing the performance of these assets.
During the fourth quarter we started production on our first five Noble design completions in the Eagle Ford.
And based on our review of public data our first three design completions which tested wider lateral spacing and higher profit concentrations are among the most productive Eagle Ford wells ever completed.
We also announced 30-day results on two additional wells today.
The average 30 day IP for these wells was over 4 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and this is remarkable when you look at the fact that they were drilled by Rosetta on tighter 500 foot lateral spacing.
Production from these two wells when normalized to a 5 000 foot lateral is also significantly above our 3 million barrel EUR type curve which is based on wider lateral spacing.
Capital allocation for the Texas asset is approximately $250 million.
60% is expected to be spent in the Eagle Ford primarily to continue Gates Ranch development.
The remaining 40% will be spent to begin our operated appraisal work in the Delaware Basin.
Our first two completions in the Delaware are beginning production this month and while we have pulled back capital in these assets from prior expectations I still expect higher volumes in 2016 versus 2015 pro forma driven mostly by the Eagle Ford.
In the Marcellus total capital for this year is currently planned at $150 million.
We've reduced activity to zero drilling rigs with plans for the JV to be cash flow neutral.
Focus will be on a limited number of completions in the non-operated dry gas area and will be weighted towards the first half of the year.
As such this is expected to deliver modestly higher volumes versus full-year 2015.
The Gulf of Mexico finished the year strongly with Big Bend and Dantzler starting production during the fourth quarter ahead of schedule and on budget.
Our Gulf of Mexico strategy of pursuing high-quality reservoirs near existing infrastructure generates substantial value.
A full year of Big Bend and Dantzler along with the Gunflint startup will contribute significant year-on-year oil volume growth during the coming year.
Noble's Gulf of Mexico budget is $250 million for 2016.
As we complete the Gunflint project the vast majority of capital will be for exploration and appraisal activities.
The lineup includes the Silvergate prospect which is currently drilling and an appraisal well for our 2014 Katmai oil discovery.
Silvergate is a Miocene target with a resource range between 30 million and 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross with nearby subsea tieback potential and results are expected by the end of the first quarter.
In Israel natural gas sales volumes averaged 250 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day during the fourth quarter.
This represents an increase of 9% from the same period last year mainly due to robust power generation demand.
Strong natural gas demand is continuing into 2016 not only from this year's early cold weather but also from the expanded use of natural gas over other power generation source fuels.
In 2016 we have included approximately $100 million for pre-FID capital expenditures on our Eastern Mediterranean projects.
The region is fundamentally short gas and will focus this year on finalizing gas sales agreements within Israel and with multiple regional customers.
As we progress the technical and commercial readiness of our projects we are operating with the following principles: First and foremost ensure that our development concepts match market demand.
Second we remain focused on meeting and growing demand for natural gas within Israel while diversifying our regional market opportunities.
And third we are managing project risk through financing including the potential involvement of international financial institutions.
I'd now like to take a couple of minutes and provide an update on our current thinking about the Leviathan development.
Along with our FPSO development concept we are also progressing another design that utilizes a fixed platform to ensure timely first production.
The initial development under this fixed platform concept would be anchored by Israeli domestic demand Jordan power needs and Egyptian industrial demand.
While continuing to refine the technical requirements initial capacity could start at over 1 BCF billion cubic feet of gas per day and is quickly expandable to more than 2 BCF a day.
This option provides the most flexibility to match contracted volumes with accelerated development while retaining the capability to meet existing and growing demand.
As you would expect pre-production capital outlays can be substantially reduced by this design modification along with the current service cost environment.
This will all be firmed up as we move through 2016 securing necessary gas contracts recosting the final technical project and finalizing project financing to move forward to FID.
Additionally we continue to work with L&amp;G plant owners in the region to secure gas contracts.
A combination of our high-quality Eastern Mediterranean reservoirs with idle L&amp;G plants positions us well to be competitive in the global L&amp;G world.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thanks Gary.
We've highlighted this morning how we executed exceptionally well during 2015.
We did what we said we would do and then some.
We know these are no ordinary times but Noble is no ordinary company.
We've outlined the 2016 program today that ensures we maintain financial strength and operating capabilities.
It provides flexibility to adapt in any environment.
And it positions Noble Energy to build long-term value.
We believe the prudent approach is to manage the business within total cash flow while keeping our eyes focused on the long term.
How can we say this because our diverse portfolio and capabilities have us uniquely positioned to differentially outperform in 2016 and beyond.
At this time Debbie we'll go ahead and open the call to questions.
Thank you.
And we'll take our first caller Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Good morning Dave.
I first wanted to ask you Noble has a lot of strong operating momentum in 2016 with the Gulf of Mexico Wattenberg and the flush Eagle Ford completions.
I wanted to see if you could perhaps give us your thoughts -- I know it's early but sustaining that operating momentum as you think about 2017.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Arun yeah appreciate the comments.
And highlighting the momentum that Gary his team and actually the whole organization has put in place and realized as we've gone through 2015 and what we are seeing already moving into 2016.
As you look beyond 2016 into 2017 you have to look at the pieces of the portfolio and kind of just think through each one of those and how they are impacted.
The Eastern Med for example is going to be flat to up depending on demand.
In the Gulf of Mexico we should see some improvement in 2017 versus 2016 because you're bringing Isabella back on.
We've got Isabella workover here in the first quarter impacting 2016.
We'll bring that back on so you'll have impact of Isabella and then you'll have a full-year of Gunflint in 2017.
West Africa you will have the full-year of Alba which has been impacted this year in 2016 by the downtime on putting the compression project in.
That should offset the decline on Aseng and Alen so West Africa should be flat to essentially up.
So the international offshore portfolio will give you good sustenance if you will underlying the production base.
Then in U.S.
I would assume the Texas properties will continue to grow in 2017 and then at the current type investment levels you could see some decline in the Marcellus and the DJ.
But when you think about 2017 overall the way I think about it at kind of the 2016 spending level you probably remain fairly flat.
But I think a lot of work and a lot of time is going to be on looking at where we want to set up the 2017 program before we go too far down the road as to what we'd actually be spending.
That is very helpful as we think about 2017.
My follow-up or second question really regards the Delaware Basin it looks like you guys will be turning in the sales about 10 wells.
Gary could you give us a little bit more detail around where the completion activity is focused and a little bit about expectations for those wells and then just maybe discuss some offset wells that you see in the area.
I'd say those wells are spread throughout kind of the core part of the acreage that we're focused on.
This year remains a bit more of a appraisal delineation well as we bring some of our own completion techniques to the Basin.
So we're just now bringing our first two completions on this month.
With those we're trying two different completion techniques; one a hybrid gel frac that's been more typically used in the area and also our first slickwater completion in the area.
So we'll see how those perform.
We'll continue to test some other things this year.
I would expect performance relative to historical performance to be up similar to what we've seen as we've brought new completion techniques to the Eagle Ford and similar to our history in the Marcellus and DJ over the years as we continue to refine things.
So still a bit early this year to see what we've got just bringing the first two wells on but excited to get those on and see how we continue to progress the development of that acreage.
Okay.
Thanks a lot gentleman.
We'll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Good morning guys and good results.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning Evan.
Good morning Evan.
I guess it's never too early to focus on 2017.
So I'm looking to follow-up on one of the prior comments.
How do you think about the priorities? (25:34) grows your balance sheet into 2017 and more specifically what oil price would you expect to need to being a reacceleration process.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think the priority is assuming you're in the same price environment or the same as this year which is managing that balance sheet and also keeping an eye on both the near and long-term capabilities that you're continuing to build.
I think as we looked at this year we've built the capital budget from ground up.
We looked at what commitments and requirements we had and then how much discretionary capital and where would we put the first crunch of the discretionary capital I mean that's kind of been in the Texas and the DJ Basin right now.
And then you're watching your cash flow and you're watching where that comes together.
So I think for this environment we're going to continue to position ourselves to manage within cash flow and I think we have the portfolio that allows us to do that and still maintain a strong underlying foundation.
Great.
I appreciate that guys.
And my second is a follow-up to your Eastern Med comments what – maybe I missed it can you – what's the latest timeline on the Leviathan progression that new concept timeline to submit the development plan and FID? I'll leave it at that.
Thanks.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah I'll let Keith – we've got our expert Keith Elliott here he can talk a little more on how he is thinking about things.
But I'd just say things are still moving along.
We've got all the potential customers at the table.
We're outlining some flexibility in different scenarios on development plans that can even create more value potentially and continue to accelerate the project as it makes sense as things come together.
But let me just let Keith talk a little bit on how he's thinking of development plans and how the timing...
Yeah Evan so we're still focused as we always have been on delivering a quality product and quality project first.
Really the course of 2016 that's kind of got as Dave said sort of four key areas that we're working on.
We made a lot of progress in 2015 on the regulatory framework and that resolved.
Now we're focusing on the technical work revising and optimizing the development scenario.
As you heard looking at concluding our gas marketing contracts and of course getting our project financing lined up and our view is that we can be in a place to have that all finished out by the end of the 2016.
Debbie I think we're ready to move on to the next question.
We'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons &amp; Company.
Good morning guys.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hey Dave.
Real quickly in your prepared remarks and in your slides you referenced the potential to monetize portions of your portfolio and use that for de-leveraging.
Can you give us a little bit more color around that in terms of scale scope and is there a target leverage metric you're trying to get to? Just any kind of additional details there would be helpful.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think we've already seen some of the monetization take place here in the first quarter with a couple hundred million from Tanin and Karish and what we talked about on selling down some interest in Cyprus.
I mean we know we've got some unique assets in Eastern Med for example.
We know as part of the framework that we are going to sell down some Tamar interest over time.
Again we've got a significant period of time – six years to do that.
But it does give you an opportunity as that value is realized whether it's Tamar or whether it's some interest in Leviathan to have some assets that are positioned a little differently than some of the rest of the world out there.
I think the other thing we've talked about and it is still on the shelf if you will is just continuing to unlock value in the midstream part of our business.
I think that's another unique high-value asset piece that can help in that whole portfolio mix over some period.
Okay.
Appreciate that.
And then maybe switching gears a little bit you also referenced a tax policy change in your release.
Can you talk a little bit about that decision what it does for you guys going forward? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Let me have Ken kind of highlight that.
Yeah Dave.
See like many people with offshore earnings had a APB 23 assertion on that said that we would continue to reinvest our foreign earnings internationally and not bring them back to the U.S.
at that point in time.
As we looked at it in 2015 at the end of the year we removed that assertion and that allowed us to utilize the foreign tax credits very effectively and so what that means is we have then full fungibility of about a couple billion dollars of additional monies that could be repatriated through time to the U.S.
So it adds a lot to our flexibility and it was in a sense a good time because we could utilize the foreign tax credits efficiently.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think Dave it's consistent with a number of things we've been doing to make sure we provide ourselves the most flexibility as we can.
I appreciate that.
I assume it also makes maybe forward guidance on international tax a little bit easier for all of us.
Is that a fair characterization? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yes I think that's true because you'll see then it will effectively be more the statutory rate.
So it should make Brad's life a little easier.
Another benefit.
Great.
I appreciate it guys.
Great work.
We'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.
Hi.
Good morning guys.
I just wanted to get back on the new comments on this fixed platform concept for the Eastern Med.
Are we to read anything in terms of I guess in the script what was discussed was Israel domestic Jordan power which we have heard about but then Egyptian industrial demand.
Is that still the same L&amp;G concept we have been talking about? Or is this a different customer? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think it's a reflection of all the customers.
I think the customer base and the customer needs have done nothing but grow as we have been in discussions over the last year or two.
What this is a reflection of is being able to match up as some of these contracts come together we can make decisions and then scale this as we go and essentially match it to the timing of contracts as they come together be able to keep pushing forward and accelerate.
And one of the other things and Keith mentioned it a little bit is probably take advantage of actually a better cost environment as you start looking at the fixed platform concept if that is where we end up with on this because one it probably utilizes capabilities of the industry a little better and it probably also ties into what we've already done over there.
So there is a knowledge base that's already built.
But I think it is kind of a win-win on all fronts.
No read-through to any different outlook as far as all the potential customers.
I'd say all the potential customers are still at the table.
But just the recognitions and things will come to place at different time periods and as they do it will enable us to continue to move forward faster.
Great okay.
Thank you.
I appreciate that Dave.
And I guess on that I guess the benefit relative to an FPSO is scalability.
And also is the – is the Israeli domestic market your view of that market in at the end of the decade significantly higher than it was just a couple of years ago? Is that fair to say as well? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think it – like the rest of the regional bases; we're seeing more potential demand.
I mean we're seeing and I think Gary alluded to it briefly but we're starting to see some indications there could be more demand even coming in places early as this year that we're going to keep a close eye on as there's continued movement to generate more of their power with gas.
Right.
Okay.
I was wondering if I could slip in one other maybe for Ken just in terms of how we should think about project financing.
I know it's early but as you think about 2017 and the capital call coming how should we think about this? Is it – was this consolidated debt at the NBL corporate level is there another structure here? How should we all think about funding this project in a muted commodity price recovery scenario? Yeah.
Sure we continued all throughout the last year to keep the banking sector warm on Leviathan financing and we still see that there.
If you look at the (35:30) guys did very successful financing on Tamar on a project basis.
Those bonds actually got investment grade rating and continue to trade very well.
So our sense is the bank market will be there.
Our intent will be not to add new equity in from – into Israel but rather leverage the things that Dave talked about in terms of some partial monetization of assets.
We just had realized $200 million from non-producing assets there.
And so I think the financing will be either a project finance or an RBL type of financing.
For our share it will count as debt.
And if it's project finance it still probably will be counted as debt.
We'll think about it that way.
And then we'll also try and leverage multilaterals or export credit agencies to help support the project both financially and from a risk standpoint.
So all that effort continues.
And so I don't see it as a pacing item to enable sanction.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> And I think then going hand-in-hand with some of this – I've also stepped back and looked at just some of the things that have happened over last quarter over in Israel.
We've seen now export approval to Egypt.
We've seen longer-term LOIs with parties in Egypt for gas from Leviathan.
We've seen additional demand to your point earlier about in-country additional demand coming forward for Leviathan gas.
So I think where we are with this framework in place where we are with keeping the external financing parties well-aligned as we have pulled this whole thing together it's just created a lot of momentum and we just got to keep things moving forward.
Great.
Thank you very much.
We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Thanks good morning everybody.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning Doug.
Dave I wonder if I could hit the hedging comment.
Obviously you've got some hedging in place for this year.
In the event I'm thinking – in the back of my mind I'm just looking at what the credit agencies have done for the whole sector in terms of their debt.
Let's assume that they were right and we got fairly onerous outlook.
Then obviously your hedging gains I'm guessing roll off back end of this year.
Where is the flexibility in the portfolio going into 2017 if that was the case? How would you think about where you would take capital from? And I've kind of got Leviathan in the back of my mind as well.
We'll do that one first and then I've a follow-up.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah you have to look at the different components.
I think even in the case of Leviathan as we get things sanctioned you probably got a couple hundred million $300 million potential capital needs next year that I think we should be able to cover from the ring fencing concept that Ken talked about.
So when you compare apples-to-apples for the rest of the program you got some of the of the Gulf of Mexico both Gunflint dropping off as far as capital needs next year.
You've got rig commitments dropping off part of the year next year.
Alba compression project will be done this year.
So when you look at truly committed portions next year there is very little.
Most all the capital next year will be discretionary.
That'll be driven by what we elect to invest in relative to how we're looking at our cash flow.
So we should still think about you living within cash flow irrespective of the debt (39:31)? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think that's how we are running of our business in this environment.
Okay.
Then my follow-up someone touched on that earlier about the disposal program but we've seen a lot of companies talk about monetizing assets.
I'm just curious is it the unique aspects of your portfolio geographically that gives you confidence you can still get that done for example Israel? Or do you see opportunities still in this market in your lower 48 portfolio? And I'll leave it there.
Thanks.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> The good part about our lower 48 portfolio it's essentially been cleaned up and cored up to what we're focusing on is high quality with tremendous upside value opportunities.
So any trimming in the lower 48 portfolio would be around the edges on that so there's no dependency here if you look at things going forward on any big trimming on our lower 48 portfolio.
Where we've talked about sales or divestments is really around early monetization and how we manage the cash both inflow and outflow in eastern Med.
And I think that is unique to us.
That's really helpful Dave.
I guess it's just really more about having confidence that folks can execute asset sales.
I guess you're in a much stronger position than others.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah and I don't think we're real reliant on that as being part of the program.
I think where that comes into place is part of the program of this ring fencing around the Eastern Med.
Got it.
I'll leave it there.
Thanks very much.
We'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Good morning Dave and to the rest of your team there.
If I could ask another question about the Eastern Med and I guess everyone wants to ask about where you're selling gas for $5 right now.
But the recent news about the Israeli Supreme Court suggesting that framework should be sent to the Knesset.
Is that – should we look at that as just a sideshow or is that more part of the main act? And hopefully you can shed light on how we should look at that.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Well I think it's no surprise that this was going to go to the Supreme Court to be brought up and discussed with an expectation that any of the opposition to the framework was going to take this to the Supreme Court and they were going to have to weigh in at a certain point in time.
So I'd say this is part of the process right now.
I think what I am focused on and what's important is when you look at the comments from the government on all of this and the comments on the total framework being critical to move forward I think that's definitely in the place that we are.
And I'd go back to how everything has come together as this framework has come together how the customers have come to the table how the demand has probably held up or increased and how we've moved forward to come up with some alternatives and options that can keep this project the Leviathan project especially moving forward as quick as possible and maybe even accelerate it as some of the contracts come together.
But I think us and the government are in complete agreement on the necessity of the framework and the urgency of the framework and it's time to keep moving forward.
Got it.
Got it.
That's helpful.
And then if I could just go in a completely new direction.
The Codell results you guys in I believe it was in East Pony could you talk more about that? I think you mentioned that they were kind of equivalent to some of the Niobrara wells in the area which sounds really good.
And I'm wondering if that – how much appraisal of that Codell zone might be part of 2016? If you can kind of take your temperature on that.
Yeah Charles I don't know how many we'll drill in 2016 yet to be honest.
We've drilled the one up in East Pony today.
The Codell gets quite a bit thinner up in that part of the field so the one we drilled was more of an appraisal type test to see what we would get.
We are very encouraged with the results and how they compare to the Niobrara development in the area.
We need to see how that holds up a bit over time and where that could lead to.
But the Codell in that area is certainly not anything we've really counted on too much in development plans in the past.
So it could be interesting.
Okay that's helpful Gary.
Thanks a lot.
We'll take our next question from Dave Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Good morning guys.
And thanks for the time.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hi Dave.
Thinking about your 2016 outlook just very specifically in Israel I mean have you included any regional sales or any interruptible volumes in your outlook for this year? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> No Dave and that's a good point to make sure we emphasize.
We have not.
We've essentially assumed a fairly flat demand given how strong the demand was in 2015.
And so besides any interruptible impact the other thing we're going to be watching pretty close is just the in-country demand.
As I've said we're starting to see some indication that there is some more push to use more gas for power instead of other fuels.
And just don't really have a feel for how much that could be yet but we'll be watching that pretty close this year.
And that would be the mainly third quarter summertime (45:30).
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I'd say you can see that start to trickle in fairly soon.
Oh really? Okay.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> By first half of the year we could start to see some impact of that hopefully.
And then last year you'll made a pretty strategic acquisition of Rosetta and there's been a lot more pain in the industry and you talked about your move on the tax side to make more liquidity available.
How do you think about additional opportunities at Noble as a consolidator going forward? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think as we have talked about in the past we'll continue to do our business development work to look at what would be priorities mainly from quality of asset.
Rosetta jumped to the front because of the quality of asset and the value we felt we could bring to that asset base.
So anything else going forward would have to have those same attributes.
I'd say right now I'm just not seeing things close the gap on expectations from buyer and seller at this point.
So it is not something I anticipate anytime real soon.
But we keep our capacity and financial firepower available to take advantage of opportunities.
But I'd say those will be further down the road at this point.
What we don't want to do is take on other people's problems.
So it would have to be high-quality assets that also would make a positive difference from an overall balance sheet and just future quality and opportunity base for the company so...
Thanks for the perspective.
We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Thank you good morning.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning.
Going back to the Eastern Med you spent some time talking about the various volume impacts here.
Can you talk more on the pricing in the current low oil price and tough spot natural gas price environment how you see some of the Eastern Med export gas price opportunities looking? And how oil prices versus spot L&amp;G prices versus what you're already getting with the Israel contract would play into that? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I will give you just a quick overview and then Keith is closer to it and can talk a little bit about it.
But when you look and you even go back to how we were talking about contracts before there is a mix of different contracts and what you're competing with.
You're competing in some cases against importing L&amp;G or higher-cost fuels into countries at different points and in some places like the existing idle L&amp;G plant you're looking at what makes sense there giving that you've got a high-quality known gas source that you can tie in with probably one of the lowest-cost L&amp;G plants in the world.
So you're kind of balancing both of those types of contract and potential pricing outlooks.
So each one has a different characteristic.
I'll let Keith talk a little bit about how he is seeing things playing out.
Thanks Brian.
So as Dave said I think we see the market to be too if you will – the regional market to be too fundamentally connected but slightly different markets i.e.
in one case you're competing against the alternative of being imported L&amp;G and in the other case you're competing into the L&amp;G global market through supply to these idle L&amp;G plants in the region.
And so as you look at that market that's I'll call more connected to regional pipeline export then what you see there is a market that's very well represented by the existing contracts that we have in place and certainly in some cases some premiums to those contracts.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think when you look at it on the scope of different things current contracts in place in Israel I probably wouldn't expect a whole lot of price swing on those.
I'd say on the future contracts as Keith talked about having this known high quality of gas in the quantities that we have it right adjacent to huge regional demand and growing in-country needs is going to keep us very highly competitive on a global market basis here as we go forward.
Got it.
Okay.
And then not to go back to the CapEx-cash flow point but I will again.
You've mentioned a few times that in this environment you want to keep CapEx and cash flow aligned.
Is there an oil price or what oil price would this – no longer represent this environment? Or what oil price would you be more willing to spend above cash flow? If any? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I don't know.
I mean that's hard to speculate on at this point.
I think you just have to see how it plays out and where your confidence is on where price is going to.
I think no matter what it makes good business sense to watch your cash and make sure you're directing and allocating your capital to not only the highest return projects but the projects that create the greatest value per dollar invested and that's just the way we'll continue to look at it.
Great.
Thank you.
We'll go next to Michael Rowe with TPH.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Hi good morning.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hi Mike.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> I see that in the Marcellus you all expect that gas volumes will be up marginally on a year-over-year basis but I was wondering if you could give some context around how you see that trajectory throughout the year given that you had a very strong exit rate in 2015? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think given the capital profile and how we're managing that within cash I think you would expect the second half of the year to be lower than the first just given the activity level.
Michael this is Gary.
I think we mentioned in the prepared comments that those completions that we are doing this year are heavily weighted towards the first part of the year.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Okay makes sense.
And I guess last I think this was touched on a little bit earlier but wanted to go back to your thoughts around target credit metrics and sort of how you see those oscillating throughout the year given this 2016 outlook and is there a certain type of threshold that you're looking to protect utilizing non-core asset sales and spending within cash flow? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Okay let me let Ken touch on that.
He's been – him and his team have been in constant communication with the agencies.
Yeah Mike I think we look at all the metrics and we also stress test at very lower decks than the agencies use.
So I think we're comfortable that we can continue to maintain strong liquidity and as we are not outspending cash flow maintain our debt position in such a way that we're not going to create any issues for ourselves.
So I think that's the prudent thing to do now.
Spend within cash flow manage the business that way and then if we have some portfolio proceeds we'll certainly have to take a look at that in the context of de-levering as Dave mentioned.
The term loan that we did was very advantageous in that it's another synergy from Rose (53:41) and saving about $50 million of annual interest costs.
But the other thing that was most attractive was it gave us the ability to potentially pay down some debt as we move forward.
All of our debt to date had been bond debt which had some friction involved in any prepayment.
This gives us full flexibility.
So that's how we'll manage going forward.
And as Dave mentioned we'll continue to stay closely engaged with the agencies; the recent S&amp;P announcement reaffirming our investment-grade rating was welcome.
And we'll just have to continue to work through that with other agencies.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think the key – just to add a little bit to that.
I think the key has been to getting in action early.
If you go back to – we started to get into action late 2014 very quickly not knowing how long we'd be lower for longer.
It's turned into longer for lower I guess.
The other piece of that is I think we are doing the right things in the decisions we are making and getting out in front of this and I think we have seen that somewhat reaffirmed in just what S&amp;P came out with a couple of weeks ago.
Yeah I mean we've had some conversations with the oil and gas heads and rating committees and when they lay out what actions people should be taking to Dave's point we can check the box that we've done all those things.
So – and we were there early to Dave's point.
So I think we're in good shape on that.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Appreciate the commentary.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thanks Mike.
We'll go next to John Herrlin with Société Générale.
Yeah thank you.
Just another one on Leviathan.
If you went to the fixed platform decision what kind of lead time would you need? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think actually that's where we'd some advantage.
I think that would be part of what would help with the acceleration overall given that you're moving to something that is more tried-and-true and off the shelf if you will.
I don't know Keith any other thoughts? Yeah.
I think really we would expect the project if you go down that pathway to be something that we could deliver on an accelerated timeline versus what we could do with an FPSO.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think either way John your higher capital levels will start to kick in in 2018 and 2019.
Okay.
Next one for me you're focusing on a lot of your core areas.
Clearly you have enough midstream capacity now.
What about down the line? How far out are you looking? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I'll let Gary comment because he is in discussion on these.
But you were looking at least a couple years out.
Yeah I mean John when we look at our plans in each of the core areas and how that matches to our firm transport capacity firm processing capacity in each area we feel very comfortable with what we've got.
Great.
Thank you.
We'll go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Irene? Irene your line is open.
Check your mute button on your side please.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Go ahead.
We'll move on to our next caller.
We'll go to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.
Hi.
Good morning everyone.
You're in good shape and in that context a lot of other companies are selling assets.
Could you just comment on any interest you might have in what's out there? Thanks.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I'll go back to my earlier comment that – and you hit it at the beginning.
I mean we're focused on continuing this execution and operating momentum on our asset base because the last thing we want to do is dilute our quality of asset with something else.
Like I mentioned we're not interested in bringing in anybody else's problems or something to deal with and take away from our focus on executing the portfolio that we have.
So we'll continue to keep our eyes open on what would be attractive to us.
And continue to keep a priority list of things like we had when we did Rosetta.
But I just don't see anything like that in the near-term.
Sure understood.
These are kind of follow-up questions really.
But could you go back to Israel and at a high-level talk about what the outlook is there for pricing and the extent to which there is a threat from low oil prices? You've mentioned that demand is very good.
Again could – I know you've somewhat been over this but could you just talk about what the structure is there for the market that causes the outlook for demand to be so good and for prices to be so unique relative to almost anywhere else in the world? Thanks.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think we've touched on the on the pricing.
I don't know if I have a whole lot more to add on that on the demand.
You're seeing the regional demand in Egypt you're seeing the need in Jordan you're seeing the increase demand potential in Israel Turkey has reached out they're interested in more gas over there.
You have the potential with tying in with Cyprus at some port to get more into the EU piece.
So you've got a lot of regional pieces moving around and that are interested in things.
We just need to focus on bringing things to the table.
And what we've talked about here today is as we bring things to the table we can make decisions to move forward.
Yeah when you look at the competitive threat from cheap oil why is that not a bigger deal? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think – go ahead Keith.
Paul I guess if you look at the core structure of our Israel business I think just like we have a diverse portfolio across the company we have a diverse location within our existing gas sales contract.
So some of our customers in the past have chosen to take on gas contracts that are more inflation indexed.
Others have chosen to take on gas contracts that are more oil indexed.
But those contracts typically have floors in them.
And so I think that's why you see some of the confidence that we can...
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well and you've got not to forget these are long term contracts.
I mean in most cases you're talking about 15-year contracts that start up say 2019 2020.
So what you're looking at is pricing from 2020 through 2035 when you're looking at these initial contracts.
Yeah and I guess a general observation would be that the economies and population pressure there is kind of stronger than you agreed in the press? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think the best indication we have is that customers that are at the table and the discussions about how much gas they would like to talk about.
Hey Debbie this is Brad Whitmarsh.
I have us a couple of minutes past our hour time limit.
I don't show we have any other questions.
So with that I think Noble's call we'd would like to thank you for joining us today.
I know there is a competitor call here joining right after us.
We'll be around all day to answer questions so look forward to talking to many of you and thank you again for joining us.
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation.
This does conclude today's conference.
