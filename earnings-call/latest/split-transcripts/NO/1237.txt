Scott? Thanks Andres and thank you all for joining our call today.
I am pleased to report that this has been another strong quarter for RAIT.
This is demonstrated by our results this quarter in a number of key areas when compared to the first quarter of 2012.
AFFO increased 100% to $18.6 million during the quarter from $9.3 million.
AFFO per share increased 48% to $0.31 per share during the quarter from $0.21.
Total revenues increased 27% to $58.3 million from $45.8 million.
Operating income increased 326% to $14.4 million from $3.4 million.
In addition net operating income from our portfolio of owned properties increased to $12.8 million or 16% from $11 million at the first quarter of 2012.
On a link quarter basis AFFO per share was $0.02 lower mainly due to severance expense of approximately $1.1 million in the quarter and due to RAIT not receiving the full quarter’s income benefit from the deployment of proceeds from our December equity offering.
It’s important to reiterate that it typically takes up to 90 days to fully deploy proceeds from our capital raising activity.
We expect to fully deploy the capital from our March offering by the end of the second quarter.
We are clearly experiencing growth in all aspects of our business loan originations conduit loan sales and property net operating income.
This growth plus stable credit performance within our loan portfolio are the key drivers of our operating performance.
Loan production continues to ramp reflecting the investment in our loan origination and credit underwriting department.
During the quarter we funded $95 million of loans including $69 million of conduit loans $21 million of bridge loans and a $5 million mezzanine loan to the balance sheet.
Repayments in our CRE loan book were minimal at $2 million during the quarter.
We saw $41 million of conduit loans during the first quarter as compared to no loan sales during the first quarter of 2012 as the conduit loan sale initiative didn’t begin in earnest until then second half of 2012.
As a result the performance across our core businesses RAIT’s board announced our third consecutive quarterly common dividend increase to $0.12 per share for the first quarter of 2013 representing a 20% from the prior quarter’s dividend and a 50% increase from the first quarter 2012 dividend.
And at this point I’d like to turn the call over to Jim to go through the financial results in more detail.
Jim? Thank you Scott.
During the first quarter AFFO increased 48% to $0.31 per share up from $0.21 in the first quarter of 2012.
Compared to Q1 2012 investment interest income was up $3.3 million due to increase loan production while investment interest expense was down $1.5 million as our interest rate hedges continue to amortize according to their term.
As a result net interest margin increased $4.3 million a 225 increase.
As we have highlighted on previous earnings calls for the remainder of 2013 we are expecting additional savings when compared to 2012 in our interest rate hedge cost associated with our CRE CDO of approximately $2.3 million as $44 million of hedges won’t continue to amortize.
For the three-month period ended March 31st 2013 our loan production was $95 million with $69 million associated with our conduit business.
The new loans we are closing have underwritten [inaudible] ranging from 58% to 83% and debt yields ranging from 8% to 16%.
From a portfolio perspective we continue to see improved credit statistics within our non-accrual loans decreasing to $68 million or $6.1% of our loan portfolio.
We continue to maintain loan loss reserves at approximately 38% of our non-accrual loans and believe that we adequately reserve for any potential future losses.
Rental income increased by 9% or $2.3 million in Q1 2013 as compared to Q1 2012 due to the three properties we acquired since March 31st of 2012 and the continued improvement in occupancy and rental rates in the historical real estate portfolio.
Multi-family occupancy at the end of Q1 2013 was 92.6% up from 90.4% in Q1 2013.
Average office and retail occupancy at the end of Q1 2013 was 69.7% up from 69.1% in Q1 2012.
The rental rates also continue to improve with multi-family rates increasing to $720 per unit per month during Q1 2013 a 4% increase since Q1 2012.
Lastly fee and other income is up $5.8 million in Q1 2013 as compared to Q1 2012 primarily due to the sale of $41 million of condo loans which resulted in $3.1 million of profit during the current quarter.
With respect to our expenses a couple of items of note interest expense for Q1 2013 is down $1.2 million compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to lower outstanding debt and lower interest cost and $25 million of subordinated debt that flipped from a fixed rate to a floating rate of interest during the second quarter of 2012.
Property operating expenses for Q1 2013 increased by $600 000 as compared to the first quarter of 2012.
All of this increase was a result of the three properties acquired since March 31st 2012.
The improvement in rental revenue and stability of our property operating expense improved net operating income by $1.7 million to $12.8 million for Q1 2013 a 16% increase since Q1 2012.
Combined compensation and administrative expenses are down to approximately 18% of total revenue in Q1 2013 as compared to 21% of total revenue in Q1 2012.
Included in compensation expense in Q1 2013 is 1.1 million of savings cost that are non-recurring.
Excluding this one-time item are combined compensation and administrative expenses are consistent with Q1 2012 on a dollar basis but down significantly to 17% of our reported revenue as compared to Q1 2012.
For the first quarter of 2013 operating income was $14.4 million a 326% increase over Q1 2012 operating income of $3.4 million.
This is an $11 million increase quarter to quarter.
The combination of conduit loan sales the broad improvement of our margin and our property drove our operating income higher in Q1 2013 as compared to Q1 2012.
As of five quarters we reported a GAAP net loss for Q1 2013 of $91 million or $1.50 per share.
The GAAP net loss was attributable to $100 million of continued negative changes in the fair value of our various financial instruments.
The primary driver of the negative changes and the fair value of our financial instrument was an increase in the market price of the legacy Taberna securitization liabilities that we consolidated.
Please remember that the changes in the fair value of our financial instruments are non-cash.
As such we believe that our presentation and discussion of AFFO is more indicative of our financial performance.
With respect to our CRE CDO we continue to meet all of our overcollateralization tests.
At March 31st 2013 CRE CDO I reported a OC test of 126.8% above the required level of 116.02%.
CRE CDO II reported an OC test of 117.7% above the required level of 111.07%.
These OC test results are largely unchanged compared to year-end 2012.
As of March 31st 2013 we continue to maintain good liquidity and capital available for investment.
In March 2013 we accept the capital market and there is proceeds of $70 million.
That offering closed in April 2013.
We ended the quarter with $483 million of capital available for investment comprised of $64 million of cash on hand $247 million of availability under our two conduit warehouse line $137 million of availability under our bridge loan facility and 35 million of remaining commitment from Almanacs affiliate.
Lastly after our pay down of 19.4 million of recourse date in the first quarter of 2013 we have no unsecured recourse debt inventories until April 2016.
Scott this concludes the finance report.
Back to you.
Thanks Jim.
Let’s take a moment to discuss our focus for the remainder of 2013.
The theme for RAIT continues to be growth.
Our pipelines for both conduit and bridge loan opportunities continue to grow including the pipeline of accepted loan applications which has steadily increased since the beginning of the year.
We currently have approximately $180 million of loans under application which we’re working to close by the end of the second quarter.
To support this growth we increased our loan origination staff and we’ve also added underwriters and asset managers.
Additionally the bridge loan lending business continues ramping and we’re moving forward as planned with the goal of securitizing the initial bridge loan portfolio later this year.
As of this call the initial bridge portfolio totals $48 million.
Unlike the conduit lending business where the loans are originated for sale the bridge loan production will increase our assets as we expect to retain the below investment rate chances of any future securitized loan polls on our balance sheet.
Rate will continue to originate and close loans based on solid credit fundamentals that provides strong risk adjusted returns utilizing our seasoned commercial real estate platform.
Before opening up the call for questions I’d like to update you about our capital raising strategy for independent realty trust a rate-sponsored and manage multi-family equity REIT.
On April 26th we filed an amended registration statement with the SEC that modifies our approach raising capital for RAIT.
We have moved away from raising capital utilizing the traditional non-listed IRT format and move towards an underwritten public offering of IRT’s common stock.
If successful IRT will become a listed company.
The change reflects our belief that opportunities to raise capital exist today and the publicly listed market for IRT that did not exist when IRT was formed because this amendment has not yet been declared effective by the SEC.
I’m limited in my ability to discuss this offering at this time and direct you to IRT’s filed amendment as Andres has mentioned earlier.
And at this time Operator I think we should open the call for questions.
(Operator Instructions).
As there are no questions I’d like to turn the call over to Scott Schaeffer for closing remarks.
Well I’m happy to say that we must have provided a fulsome report.
In summary rate is in a strong position and 2013 is off to a good start.
Our pipelines are growing cash flow continues to increase and we have access to capital and our balance sheet remains stable.
We look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter and thank you for joining our call today and your continued interest in RAIT.
Thank you for your participation in today’s conference.
This concludes the presentation.
You may now disconnect.
Have a good day.
