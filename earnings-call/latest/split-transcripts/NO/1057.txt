Please stand by we're about to begin.
Good morning.
Welcome to Noble Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2014 Earnings Call.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.
David Larson.
Please go ahead sir.
Thanks Melanie.
Good morning everyone.
Welcome to Noble Energy's fourth quarter and year end 2014 earnings call and webcast.
This morning we issued two news releases: one covering the fourth quarter and full year earnings and the second one laying out our outlook for 2015.
A few supplemental slides for the call were also posted to our website.
Following today's remarks by Dave Stover we'll open the call for Q&amp;A with the executive team and hope to wrap things up in less than an hour.
We would ask that participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up.
Finally I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements as well as references to non-GAAP financial measures.
You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of these.
With that let me turn the call over to Dave.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</strong> Thanks David and good morning everyone.
I'll start out with a few highlights of Noble Energy's fourth quarter before focusing on our plans for 2015.
From an execution perspective it was an excellent quarter where we delivered significant growth in our U.S.
onshore programs and progressed a number of deepwater development projects toward startup.
Sales volumes averaged a record 315 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day a 14% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2013 after adjusting for asset sales highlighting our performance with our U.S.
onshore horizontal volumes up more than 50%.
We ended the year with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent as production and non-core asset sales were offset by additions and revisions in our core areas.
Over 90% of the reserve additions came from the execution of our low-risk U.S.
onshore program with the remaining coming from the Gulf of Mexico.
We replaced 200% of our production in the U.S.
even with PUD bookings reflecting future drilling activities based on the current price environment.
On the financial side of the business we remain highly focused on maintaining substantial liquidity protecting our balance sheet and sustaining our investment grade rating.
Late in 2014 we proactively issued $1.5 billion in long-term notes at record low coupons for Noble and ended the year with $5.2 billion in liquidity including $1.2 billion in cash and $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility.
Over the last three years we've been very active in generating cash flow to the business through portfolio optimization realizing over $2 billion in after-tax proceeds from non-core asset sales and our CONE MLP IPO.
And I think it's important to mention that looking forward we will continue to seek additional ways to protect our financial strength and flexibility and monetize assets that feel are undervalued.
We've been very proactive in our hedging for 2015 with approximately 70% of global crude oil and 48% of U.S.
natural gas hedged at attractive prices.
Our Israel gas is also acting as a great natural hedge an important contributor to our cash flow during the year highlighting the benefits of our diverse portfolio.
Obviously everyone is focused on how the energy landscape has changed in the past several months.
I believe the combination of our high-quality assets deep drilling inventory strong balance sheet and fiscal discipline have us well positioned not only for the current year but for the long-term as well.
A key to our success and forward focus remains diversification which has proven to be a competitive advantage in volatile markets.
Our portfolio of opportunities around the world is well-balanced between liquids and domestic and international gas.
It includes thousands of drillable locations in two top-tier U.S.
unconventional plays both of which are well positioned on the industry cost of supply curve.
These assets are essentially held by existing production so we're not restricted in our ability to ramp up or down when appropriate.
Offshore our assets do not require large amounts of maintenance capital but contribute significant cash flow to the business and provide running room for future growth.
This combination of assets gives us a tremendous amount of optionality in how we allocate capital and manage risk.
As we look at the uncertainty surrounding commodity prices and service costs it is clear that now is not the time to push near-term production growth.
The rapid decline in commodity prices has caused industry margins and project economics to be squeezed.
With commodity prices at depressed levels costs must find a new equilibrium with product prices before we resume investing for significant growth.
The depth and duration of the current commodity cycle is unknown.
So we believe starting 2015 with a capital budget of $2.9 billion allows us to retain our financial strength and flexibility for an extended period of time.
This program aligns us with the investment environment and cash flow and we continue to be very disciplined in capital allocation and focused on cost management.
We're intensely scrutinizing our costs and have already captured significant cost savings and reductions from our service providers.
While these are primarily focused on achieving immediate cost reductions we're also looking at the opportunity to implement some structural cost changes where we'll have a long-term impact on margins and the efficiency of our business.
Now let's walk through some of the details of our 2015 program.
We've talked previously with many of you about the capital optionality in our portfolio including the U.S.
onshore program major project spending and exploration as our primary levers in the allocation process.
This year's program allocates approximately 60% of our CapEx to our core U.S.
onshore and about 35% toward development of our offshore sanction major projects which deliver substantial cash flows and value to the business.
Exploration is set at around 5% of the budget although we're still testing a couple of very material prospects that we're excited about.
In the DJ Basin we're coming off a year in which we delivered about 30% growth in our horizontal volumes and further advanced our understanding of the value upside from long laterals downspacing and enhanced completion techniques.
We're currently running a four-rig program and have focused our activity in the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas where we can drill a higher percentage of long laterals and can optimize the use of existing infrastructure.
Total capital allocation to the basin this year is around $900 million.
In 2015 we will continue to evaluate well performance from our 2014 downspacing tests to assess incremental value in the basin above our standard 16 well per section development plan.
We now have high density tests across all of our development areas with early performance meeting and in certain areas outperforming expectations.
We're not anticipating a one-size-fits-all downspace program across our acreage.
Additional production data collected this year will help fine-tune our understanding of high density spacing and ultimate recovery throughout the basin.
Early indications from downspacing continue to suggest there's a huge prize for us in the DJ.
Our capital budget assumes a $4 million average well cost for a standard length lateral in Wells Ranch and East Pony which is down meaningfully from prior years.
This has been achieved through supplier price reductions use of existing infrastructure and sustainable efficiency improvements much of which has already been captured to-date.
Our teams have been on the forefront of testing multiple completion methods in the DJ and we continue to see evidence that our sliding sleeve design is the best value.
In 2015 we will continue to modify this design for optimal stage length and fluid type both of which have the potential to reduce well costs even further.
Another factor driving efficiency enhancement in our program is the ability to drill extended reach laterals which continue to deliver higher recovery and lower well cost per lateral foot.
Approximately 50% of our 2015 wells will be extended reach.
Overall the program lateral length will average 6 500 feet per well a 20% increase over last year.
These are all components of a very competitive unconventional liquids play.
And the economics even at today's prices remain very attractive with before tax rates of return of approximately 40% and payout in under two years.
We expect third-party infrastructure to improve in 2015 beginning with the startup of the 70 Ranch compressor station which commenced in the first quarter of this year.
The Lucerne-2 plant and Rockies and Trout compressor stations are progressing for startup in the second quarter providing necessary expansion of infrastructure in the Northern Greater Wattenberg area.
In addition we have recently committed to a third-party low-pressure gathering loop in Greater Wattenberg which will have a positive impact to the overall operation of the field as early as the beginning of next year.
On the operated side we continue to build out our infrastructure in the basin and will investigate strategic opportunities to monetize these assets.
In the Marcellus total capital for 2015 is currently planned at $900 million with about 15% of the amount for midstream infrastructure.
We're continuing to work with our partner on the optimal investment for 2015.
This is not the time to be accelerating gas production therefore we've reduced Noble operated activity in the Marcellus to two rigs while retaining the ability to accelerate drilling should that make sense in the future market.
Performance in the Marcellus shows that it is a world-class asset that is being even further enhanced with completions such as Reduced Stage and Cluster Spacing.
The RSCS design continues to outperform standard completion by approximately 30% on our operated wells and we will continue to increase our use of this design in our 2015 program.
Recently gross daily production from the joint venture reached 1 billion cubic feet equivalent per day with the major contributor to our growth in 2014 being the wet Noble operated volumes.
As mentioned earlier we're completing our sanctioned oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our estimated Gulf of Mexico development budget is $600 million with three new fields to come on in the next 15 months.
The lineup of production includes Big Bend startup in fourth quarter Dantzler which has moved up to around the end of 2015 followed by Gunflint by mid-2016.
While these projects don't have a meaningful impact on 2015 average production they're certainly big contributors to our yearend in 2016 liquids rate.
We're currently finishing completion operations at the Dantzler-2 well and expect all drilling and completion operations in the Rio Grande area to be finished by mid March.
Remaining 2015 investment is focused on subsea pipeline installation at Big Bend and Dantzler and drilling and completions operations at Gunflint.
In West Africa the majority of the development capital will be directed to the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea which will create additional value by lowering decline and extending the life of the field.
We plan to resume exploration in West Africa with the Cheetah prospect offshore Cameroon.
Cheetah is an oil prospect with a 47% working interest targeting over 100 million barrels of gross resources and representing Noble's first Cretaceous test in the Douala Basin.
Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean Tamar continues to perform exceptionally well both from a reservoir and facility standpoint.
Seasonally high demand and debottlenecking of the facilities has resulted in recent record production days in excess of 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas in gross sales.
I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the regulatory environment in Israel.
For over 15 years we've been working with the government and people of Israel to explore for develop and produce natural gas.
Our success has delivered substantial value to Israel in terms of reduced fuel and electricity costs as well as new energy security.
Early last year Noble Energy its partners and the Israel Antitrust Authority reached an agreement for the consent decree that included the divestiture of the Tanin and Karish gas fields in an effort to support competition of supply and move forward the development of Leviathan.
A recent decision by the Antitrust Authority to not submit the agreed consent decree for final approval was a direct reversal of their prior agreement and another example of the uncertain regulatory environment in Israel.
As a consequence we have suspended essentially all investment in Israel except for our Ashdod compression project which is nearly complete.
Resolution of the antitrust matter along with progress on a number of additional regulatory matters is required before we can proceed with significant further investment in Israel's energy sector.
A predictable and stable regulatory environment is critical requirement in decisions related to major energy development projects.
We continue to have discussions with the government in an effort to establish the regulatory framework necessary to progress development of these world-class resources.
While no agreement has been reached to-date we remain committed to finding appropriate and workable solutions.
However we are also prepared to vigorously defend our rights related to our assets in Israel.
It's worth remembering that Israel has only been producing gas for just over a decade.
The discoveries of the giant Tamar and Leviathan fields provide the opportunity for substantial regional exports which is changing the energy landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean.
We're excited to be leading the way as further expansion of Tamar and initial development of Leviathan have the potential to materially expand energy economic and environmental benefits to Israel and the region.
We were able to sign multiple LOIs for regional export in 2014.
The most recent of these was an LOI with a customer in Egypt to supply interruptible volumes from Tamar.
The terms of the LOI include up to 250 million cubic feet per day with pricing equivalent to other export LOIs that we signed.
It's an opportunity that can have near term impact requires very little capital and would provide relief from gas shortages in Egypt.
We have not assumed any of these potential sales in our base guidance but are hopeful to commence exports this year pending government approvals.
To wrap up the Eastern Mediterranean we continue to progress plans for development in Cyprus with our discovery there providing another option to meet growing regional demand.
Our exploration investments this year companywide will be about 5% of total planned expenditures lower than past years given the environment.
While the budget is reduced the program will test an underexplored area in the Falkland Islands with multibillion barrel potential as well as our large prospect in Cameroon.
We will use 2015 as an opportunity to further strengthen and enhance our exploration portfolio.
I am confident that our best-in-class process and talented employees will continue to deliver exploration projects that will be a key contributor to the long-term growth of Noble Energy.
As I mentioned earlier now is not the time to be pushing near-term production growth.
We have scaled our capital program back and expect modest growth of approximately 5% from 2014 driven primarily in the U.S.
onshore business as well as Israel.
In the U.S.
onshore we expect meaningful growth with more than 5% growth in the DJ Basin and 40% plus in the Marcellus.
Natural gas sales from Tamar in Israel are expected to rise 10% or so year-over-year.
Volumes are anticipated to be down about 10 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-on-year in West Africa with approximately half of this amount being attributed to natural field decline and the remaining from plant turnarounds.
In the Gulf of Mexico we anticipate flat to modest declines through the year until the Big Bend startup in the fourth quarter.
While quarter-to-quarter volumes for us can vary quite a bit contribution from our Gulf of Mexico development project sets us up well for 2016.
In fact excluding whatever Israel investment turns out to be we can maintain and even slightly grow 2016 volumes at even lower capital levels than this year.
It is this portfolio and diversity of projects that provides Noble a differential advantage going forward.
For the first quarter of 2015 we expect sales volumes to range from 305 000 to 315 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with the primary variance from the fourth quarter of last year being the timing of liquid listings and planned facility downtime in West Africa.
Our U.S.
onshore business at both the DJ basin and the Marcellus are anticipated to show growth with deepwater in Israel relatively flat.
Due to uncertainty as to the depth or duration of the present cycle we believe the prudent approach to 2015 is to manage the spend more closely to cash flows.
While this plan provides us with a more modest growth rate than we previously projected our actions will continue to be focused on ensuring that we exit the current cycle with substantial operating and financial strength that will allow us to either resume a more accelerated pace of activity or pursue other opportunities that may arise.
I believe this strategy is the appropriate course of action in a volatile market.
Our U.S.
onshore development major project execution and exploration capabilities have us uniquely positioned to differentially outperform over the coming years.
Melanie at this time we'd like to go ahead and open the call for questions.
Thank you.
We will take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.</span></strong> Good morning.
This is John Abbott calling in for Doug Leggate.
We appreciate you taking our questions.
If I could start off what proportion of your Wattenberg inventory is economic in the current price environment before hedges? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well what I talked about in the inventory that we're drilling this year has about a 40% average return on that.
So what we're focusing our activity this year is in what we would consider our best economic areas which are Wells Ranch and East Pony.
And as I mentioned it allows us to also take advantage of infrastructure up there.
Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.</span></strong> Appreciate that.
And this is a follow-up here.
A number of your competitors have been delaying completion.
Why not do the same? And also as a follow-up to that coming into the year what is your uncompleted backlog in both the DJ and the Marcellus? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well we had a number of – if you go back to what we talked about last year we had a number of completions that were coming on towards the end of the year into the beginning of this year.
What we've done is we've looked at our inventory for this year and how we've laid the program out for this year.
We've actually set it up so we've spaced out our completions more through the year.
Part of doing that was tailoring that to some of the discussions on with the suppliers and service companies that went along with how we implemented some of this cost reduction very quickly here into the beginning of the year.
And part of that was also tailoring then the pace of the completions.
So we've actually slowed down and tailored that completions to tie it in with the – what we had set up from a frac crew standpoint that went into the discussions on how we implemented some very quickly reductions and completion costs here at the beginning of the year.
Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.</span></strong> I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
And we'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Good morning guys.
Thanks for taking the question.
The DJ is really interesting but I think you did a good job explaining what's going on there Dave.
I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail on how your conversations are going on the Marcellus.
And there's language in your press release that you're still working to figure out the plan for 2015 and one other kind of wrinkle to it seems to me is that it seems to me that actually because of the NGL pricing and some of the infrastructure problems up there actually the dry gas areas seem to me to be more attractive right now at least for 2015.
And so could you work that in to your discussion? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah Charles it's a good question and one we've continued to be in discussions with our partner up there on what is the right activity level.
What we've got built in right now reflects probably a decrease over where we started last fall when we started in this budget process and I'd say it's an ongoing discussion to kind of optimize what the program should be.
I think we're probably still in the camp that we could probably continue to push that down a little and I think we'll see how that progresses over time but it's a good healthy discussion.
I think in any good partnership even if you aren't completely aligned up front the structure of a good partnership is you continue to have good discussion and that's where it's going.
I mean and we've continued to bring down the program over time when you go back to last fall.
So...
Got it.
And would it be fair Dave that bringing the program down would be more on the non-op side for you guys than operated? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well we've already brought the operated side down.
We brought that down to two rigs on the wet gas.
So I think the discussion now has continued to move around what is the right amount of activity level on the dry gas portion.
Okay.
Thank you.
And then if I could ask a question about Cyprus and this may be too far afield but I thought I'd try.
Given the hurdles that have been thrown up in Israel you're – as I look at it the find you have in Cyprus is not that far west of your Leviathan find and you were talking about doing some pipeline exports from Leviathan.
So I wondered is that a possibility to do pipeline exports from Cyprus now and I'm thinking that where you didn't quite have enough for an LNG facility but that was really before this regional export market popped up and I wonder if the Cyprus find can plug into that possibility.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> No I think we believe Cyprus can still play a role in that whole Eastern Med regional picture there.
I mean one of the things we're working with them on what would be the development plan in Cyprus as you mentioned was kind of moved away from an LNG project and probably more something that would be more of a regional piece.
I think the other thing I would mention and remind you too when we talked about even the regional market on what we were looking at for our Israel volumes as we were marketing that and looking at what the size of that market could be we were seeing a market that was potentially double the size of what we even were having in those LOIs.
So I'd say there's definitely a role to be played for additional gas there.
Okay.
Thank you very much Dave.
We'll go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.
Inc.</span></strong> If I may I would like to ask you about your year-end reserve booking.
It's a little flat.
So I want to kind of pick your brains on how you have approached the PUD.
It sounds like you are taking a pretty conservative approach probably using some pretty low pricing.
Then also how did the events in Israel might or might not have impacted your year-end booking in 2014? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Okay.
Yeah on the first part of that Irene yeah we could be approaching – we don't to be in a position where you happen to if this is an extended low price environment that you're having to bring reserves off the books.
So we actually made sure when we looked at our five year projection of activity levels that we took into account the current environment without knowing when this current price environment would end.
So we were looking at it more from the aspect of being in this environment for a while.
So that influenced our onshore PUD bookings.
I think when you think about it from an Israel piece that the next big booking there will be with either some expansion at Tamar or the sanctioning of Leviathan and I think we all know we still have some regulatory hurdles and things to get in place on Leviathan to get that sanctioned.
So that will be the next big booking from Israel.
So I guess when you look at PUD bookings and especially with this five-year rule and then whatever price you want to assume it's kind of moved away from the PUDs representing any change in quality of asset or anything but more of how you're looking at tailoring your timing of your activity depending on what environment you want to project it through.
Inc.</span></strong> Gotcha.
So you're really taking a very cautious approach assuming the worst and hoping that things wouldn't turn out that way but regardless your booking's pretty solid.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Absolutely.
And then it gives you the room for as the environment turns up you're adding to it.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay thank you.
We'll go next to Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Yes.
Good morning and thanks for taking my question.
I wanted to maybe just outline a little bit about your anticipated cash flow outspend in 2015 and you mentioned earlier in your comments that you could look to monetize assets that you feel are undervalued.
And so is your intention to plug the cash flow outspend gap with those asset sales and if so which assets should we be thinking about? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I think obviously anything we can do on some asset monetization helps with that.
I think the real driver in how we've set up our program and what we're looking at this year is to move as quickly as we can irregardless of those other kind of portfolio levers as we'd call them to get our cash outflows more in line with our cash inflows.
And with what we've set up and realizing it takes little bit of time based on spending last year that rolls into this year that we expect by mid-year we should be in a good place on matching up our outflows and inflows.
And then anything else we can do with other portfolio of things can just supplement that and keep us in an even better position.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And we're planning it at conserve – this is Ken Fisher.
We're planning at a conservative deck.
When Dave says that.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
When Dave says that.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah we're working off that 50 to 55 range.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
And then just one follow-up would be you mentioned earlier trying to achieve some structural cost changes that may be distinct from just the service price reductions you're seeing as activity and rig levels are falling.
So is the thought here that these costs that you're getting on the structural side could actually continue to stay low even if we do see commodity prices rebound and then potentially get service cost inflation picking back up again? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I think it's a great opportunity to make sure everybody's laser-focused on the efficiency part of the equation and what we're working on.
I mean one of the things we put in motion a couple years ago and talked about was these integrated development plans and so forth.
And what you're saying is a large part of our drilling for example on the DJ this year is focused in areas where we can start to see more advantage of that.
We're already seeing some advantage of that on capital savings coming from the result of how we're handling facility costs water handling and so forth.
We're also seeing some of that impact on LLE and that's a little bit of what I reference when I talk about how we want to continue to embed more of these structural changes into how we go forward.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Thank you.
And we'll go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
Hi.
Good morning.
A couple questions and you've referenced this a number of times.
But as we start thinking about going forward if we look at the macro one of your competitors put a slide out today saying at $65 oil they could earn the same return as they did at $95 oil in 2012.
How do you view that internally? How much more cost reduction or efficiencies do you need to get back to say in a normalized $80 oil price environment a year ago? Now you're – that number becomes $60.
I'm just trying to get some framework around how you're thinking about the longer-term cost curve in the U.S.? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
Well I'm not going to sit here and tell you I can match a current certain price with a certain cost reduction.
I can say that the emphasis this year is starting to see more of this cost reduction.
You've seen folks talk about 10% to 20% reductions on cost.
You wanting to embed more reduction on an LOE basis too in some of this.
So I think just this cost focus this year as folks have moved away more from an activity focus that was driven by growth but now a chance to step back a little bit and look very hard at the cost side of the business the efficiency side of the business how we optimize things.
We'll see the ability to change the economics at different prices.
By how much we'll have to continue to watch as we go through the year.
Okay.
All right.
And I guess for a follow-up if I think about your cash flow CapEx I know there's some assets in the DJ that could be monetized from a midstream standpoint.
Can you just talk about what those opportunities look like how much of your portfolio you think you could monetize? Just anything around that as far as divestitures.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I think the first thing you look at is the non-producing asset piece and you kind of hit on one that's high on our radar screen is the infrastructure in the DJ Basin.
We took the first step last year in what we did with our Marcellus infrastructure and I think that's turned out to be a very nice business opportunity for us.
So I think we'll continue to look at things like that.
I think the infrastructure in the DJ lends itself.
I mean we continue to look around at our growing infrastructure in the Gulf even for example.
Who knows but that's something else that we'll continue to look at.
So there's various pieces of the business that still lend themselves to highlighting what their value can be and potentially unlocking some real value here.
All right.
Thanks for the color.
I'll jump off now.
Appreciate it.
We'll go next to Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.
Hi good morning gents.
Dave I wanted to start off talking about the DJ.
I know you guys at some of the analyst meetings have talked about your view of the DJ kind of under a major project type of umbrella where you're introducing the IDPs.
I was just wondering with the IDPs at how nimble you can be in a down cycle given your development approach that you're taking there.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
Well I mean the nice thing is we have a huge inventory in a large playing field out there when you think about the 600 000 acres or so.
When we've talked about the IDPs and what we've implemented we kind of started with Wells Ranch and then we've been moving towards East Pony.
So hand-in-hand with that is where we're going to concentrate this year's activity.
So I think we have the ability to be pretty flexible.
I think we've got the ability to adapt either way pretty quickly.
I think in this environment we probably won't do as much front-end loading of facility capital right now.
I think what it does is probably move us back just slightly on when we will see some of these other IDP bigger facility capital come in place.
But I think it is a great time to benefit from this facility infrastructure that we've put in place and that we've already built.
And I think we're going to capture some tremendous benefits of that as we match our drilling program to where we have this facility infrastructure in place this year.
That's helpful.
Just a quick follow-up just on the completion count that the guidance is based on.
I was wondering if you could just give us a ballpark of – I know you're going to four rigs in the DJ and two rigs in the Marcellus at least on the operated side.
What is the year-over-year change in completions in those two areas? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah I think just off the top of my head I think in the DJ it's probably about half close to half of what we had in 2014.
In the Marcellus I'm trying to think here and look and see if I've got something on actual completion inventory.
I don't know if I got the completion number on the Marcellus here right off hand.
If I could sneak one more in Dave I just wanted to get some details around Israel.
Obviously there's been a U-turn in terms of the anti-trust decision.
What do you think drove that and what are the potential – what are some of the remedies that they're potentially seeking in terms of your assets there? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well obviously as far as remedies we're in a lot of discussion with the government and even anti-trust on this.
So it's as far as remedies and what they're trying to accomplish they're concern is about competition over there and that really was driven by the fact that when you go back in time we were the only ones that were really successful and we were successful on a large scale over there.
I think – so where we are and I think we were surprised.
I think a lot of people over there were surprised with the reversal on that decision.
And the thing that we're focused on now and what that's highlighted is the need to put together a comprehensive framework to provide some regulatory certainty and stability going forward to make the investment decisions.
I mean when you go back to the discussions with the anti-trust commission and where we had gotten to last year we essentially agreed to and thought everybody had agreed to the resolution to that competition was selling Karish and Tanin.
When you think about that Karish and Tanin in total is about three times the size of what Mari-B was and Mari-B produced about 600 million a day for a number of years.
Right.
Okay.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> So we thought that was a pretty good solution at that time.
So right now what have entered into the equation is a discussion now of okay so how do we move forward on this.
The good part of it is that it's brought the ministries together to even better understand the situation and better understand even the importance of resolving this and resolving this quickly for the betterment of Israel and actually the whole region over there.
Thanks for your comments Dave.
And we'll go next to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Good morning guys and thanks for taking my question.
Your comment on 2016 growth on lower CapEx was encouraging.
One of the things we've been trying to think about is I know you have deepwater projects that are coming online but with a lower activity level in the Wattenberg do you have a shallower base decline at an exit at 2015 as opposed to where you're exiting 2014 on a higher activity level? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well yes Dave.
I mean the base question of that is you've got a lower amount of new production coming on.
So it lowers your delta on absolute volume coming off obviously.
I think the other piece and it points to our diversified asset base and why we think that is especially a strength in volatile price times.
One of the decisions we made was to continue with the completion and the development of our Gulf of Mexico projects.
That's going to add significant volume by the end of this year that gives us a year-on-year nice improvement out there for 2016.
The other piece not to forget about is the Tamar volumes over there and that continues to have growth potentials based on in-country demand without additional investment.
So I mean that is a -two pieces of a portfolio that we think are definitely differentiators for us.
And then on the political landscape in Israel clearly has weighed on you valuation some but thinking about where Israel is now with Tamar online and the revenues that the country generates where does that go to whenever a planned Leviathan development comes online whenever that may be at this point.
But I'm just trying to think of how much value is created to kind of the nation of Israel and why they – what is the incentives that they're thinking about from a Leviathan development? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
There's a huge incentive for them to get these projects on.
When you think that they actually capture over half the value that comes from any volume of gas whether it's sold in-country or sold in an export arrangement.
If you remember on a Leviathan we're talking about a capacity – a facility capacity of 1.6 Bcf a day and probably a run rate that would be closer in that 1 Bcf a day to 1.2 Bcf a day.
A large part of that would be targeted from – would be targeted to go to export with some portion for fill-in with whatever is needed in the domestic demand.
But you think of that relative to the perspective of Tamar and what it's doing now we've seen the figures that indicate that's 1% of their GDP growth over there.
So it's a huge impact.
Yeah David and...
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Ken can add some color.
When the export rules were passed there was external study done by McKinsey and if I remember correctly the delta value to the citizens in GDP was $230 billion.
So over the life of exports and also it was 20 more – it was estimated to be 20 more years of domestic supply because of further exploration activity.
So it's a material impact on the nation and the citizenry.
Thanks guys.
We'll go next to John Herrlin with Société Générale.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Regarding the U.S.
Dave you've given us your budget and activity for 2015.
If prices are sustained should we consider current planned activity levels to be kind of the new normal if prices stay weak or would you even cut back further? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Well I think in this environment we'd say – we'd monitor that as we go through the year but I'd say we just assume this kind of a level into next year.
The thing that would change is we'd drop out this capital from the Gulf of Mexico developments and that's where I made the statement that you can see flat to increasing production growth next year based on the way our portfolio's set up with even less capital when you think of taking the Gulf of Mexico development piece out.
Right.
Are the service companies at all willing to do term deals yet or is it still just basically discount from book? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I think that's probably all across the board I think.
One of the things that we did was focused in pretty quickly with our top 100 suppliers and service companies and engaged in discussions with all of them very quickly.
I think some of it's been some immediate change.
In fact I think we're up to talking to our top 300 now.
Some of it's been immediate impact some of it they're trying to get some costs rolled through to them that hopefully we can go back and also get some portion of that also.
So everybody's in discussion with their suppliers.
Okay.
That's fine.
Regarding the exploration budget that you cut back originally you had two wells planned in the Falkland as it could be two or one and then could you describe what the structure is at Cheetah Cameroon? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> In the Falklands we're still assuming the two wells down there.
So we've got two wells still in there and we've got the one for Cheetah probably about mid-year.
It's a Cretaceous – it's our first Cretaceous project over there.
Right.
But is it three way four way? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> If I remember it right John I think it's a four way structure.
Okay great.
Thank you.
We'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein.
Yeah quick question on the Marcellus.
It looks like that's the lion's share of your production growth this year.
Does that wedge assume a 6-rig program or are you already paring that down to less than that? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> It assumes current activity levels out there.
So.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Go ahead.
Yeah.
So we should sort of – if you achieve a reduced program out there will that impact your full-year growth? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Probably I mean the tail-end of the year not a whole lot for this year because most of the volume in there is associated with completions that get staggered probably about six months or so from when you drill them.
So anything that changed activity levels in the latter part of the year probably has a bigger impact on the following year.
Okay.
And in terms of Israel if you're generating free cash flow in Israel because of investment difficulties can you use that cash anywhere or is that preferentially spent in West Africa or in international exploration? Yeah.
The Israeli cash is CFC or controlled forward corporation cash but we have a pretty flexible structure built that allows us to fund around the world.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Other international.
Yeah.
So I think we've got a lot of flexibility there.
But you can't necessarily bring it home without getting a hit.
We have a structure that's allowed us to bring significant – we bought $1.3 billion back in 2014 without paying any incremental tax.
So we have pretty flexible structure.
Okay.
Thank you.
We'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Thank you.
Good morning.
On Wattenberg it looks like you have some line of sight to some of the third party midstream opportunities or bottlenecks getting into place and then online in the second quarter.
Do you see this clearing the deck on midstream bottlenecks or are others emerging? And should we see a step change in second half Wattenberg production or is that just offset by reduced investment? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I think when you look at the bottlenecking portion I think there's a lot of things as we mentioned Brian that are going in place in the second quarter.
There's also that what we call the Grand Parkway System which is a big loop if you will to debottleneck and be more efficient on how gas is distributed around the field that will come into place towards the end of the year beginning of the next year is when we'll really see the impact on that.
So there's some staggered things that will be coming in place and then you start to get into the next plants beyond that.
So we'll continue to have to keep our eye on what else can be done as we move through the cycle here.
And I guess the quarterly trajectory should we then expect once some of the plants are on in the second quarter that we'll see a step up in third quarter volumes or how do you think about the trajectory? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I mean that's going to have to be matched with the activity.
I think when you think of the trajectory for the DJ for example the second half of the year is probably going to be lower than the first half at this activity level.
I think when you think of the company overall I think the fourth quarter will probably be our what we would foresee now probably be our highest volume quarter when you consider the influx of some Gulf of Mexico production.
Yep.
Got it.
And then one last one.
In Israel just wanted to clarify the level of investment in your CapEx that you are planning here for this year.
Would that sustainably keep volumes flat before future expansion projects or is there some point at which your reduced level of investment would lead volumes to decline? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> No I think actually what we are investing in this year is completing the compression project so that actually gives us a little more capacity.
So I would say at this level of investment or essentially minimal to no investment going forward you ought to be able to stay flat to grow and that's going to depend on the demand up to the level of what that Ashdod compression capacity gives us.
So up to about that 1.2 Bcf a day or so.
Got it.
Thank you.
We'll go next to Joe Allman with JPMorgan.
Mr.
Allman your line is open.
Please check your mute button.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> We'll go to the next question.
We'll go next to Dave Kistler with Simmons &amp; Co.
Morning guys.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Hey.
Morning Dave.
Really appreciate all the color on 2015 and certainly understand the adjustments to CapEx seems prudent et cetera.
In the past you guys have given us longer dated plans that go out as far as five years.
Any ability to update that forecast for folks right now in terms of how we should think about going through the model? I know you're being super conservative with a $50 to $55 deck but just trying to help triangulate the next several years.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I don't think we ought to be going out too far in this environment Dave because I think we've got to tailor that to what activity levels are you going to assume and how quickly are you going to ramp back up.
I think what we wanted to do is give folks some perspective on how we see 2016 at certain level of investment to just give them some comfort on how we can sustain ourselves and even still grow some in 2016 at very low investment levels.
I think starting to project beyond that's going to depend on where you start to ramp up especially your onshore programs.
What I will say when you go back to that five-year outlook none of the resources in there have changed at least to the downside.
If anything what we've learned through our drilling programs it continues to put upward pressure on that.
So the nice thing is the resource is there.
Now the timing and pace of activity is going to be dependent on how we handle and how we match up with the financial aspect of it and that's going to be dependent on price environment and cost structure.
Yeah I appreciate those clarifications.
I know it's a difficult question obviously in the current environment.
But maybe tying that a little bit to the financials and the current liquidity position actually it seems like your target or at least what you're communicating here is to just be pushing forward that liquidity position into 2016 2017 when the environment does change so that you can ramp at that point given that the resource base is as you just highlighted actually increasing during this time period.
Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah.
I mean when you think about it we've got a wealth of inventory here.
So it makes sense for us to maintain our liquidity such that when the time is right we can move as rapidly as we want to move to start to capture this additional value.
So I think you got to tie the whole financial management with the operational management.
And the thing I like about our position is we've got a very strong financial position.
We're committed to keeping a very strong financial position.
We got an inventory a huge inventory of opportunities and we've got a great proficiency in onshore developments offshore developments exploration and major project execution.
And we're going to continue to fine tune and improve those efficiencies and proficiencies as we go.
It's one of the nice things about even our program this year.
Even at this reduced capital level we still are exposing ourselves to some very significant material exploration prospects even at this level.
So we continue to keep that exploration proficiency going.
We continue to move the major project proficiency along as with these developments in the Gulf of Mexico.
So it's not like we've set any portion of our programs and capabilities on the shelf.
I certainly appreciate that and makes sense in the current environment.
We'll go next to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.
Hey guys.
I was hoping you could follow up on what type of pricing we need to see here on the oil side and I guess the natural gas side for the Marcellus to where you'd start to feel comfortable with activity increases.
And could activity increases happen during 2015 if we saw a nice rebound as we moved into the second half? How quickly can Noble respond? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> Yeah well I think what we've talked about Leo is making sure that we're in a position that we can respond quickly.
I think when that will be is open to interpretation at this point but two things are going play into effect is what's the outlook on commodity price and how much cost are we seeing being able to pull out of the business that we feel we can sustain being out of the business and continue to keep out of it.
And how does that world match up both on commodity price and cost as we look forward.
But our objective is to maintain our flexibility so that when that time is right we can move very quickly.
All right.
I guess let's just throw in a hypothetical.
If costs are down another 10% over the next three or four months and oil's $65 in July will you guys add activity in the DJ? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> We could.
That'd probably be the first place where we'd look at it.
Okay.
And I guess just in terms of Israel can you maybe just put a little bit more color around the situation? Is it one where you guys are negotiating with the government and the ministry on what the potential outcome may be? Or is it more of one where you're awaiting the government to tell you what they need on their side and can you maybe discuss what Noble's legal rights are with regards to its assets as well? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> No.
I think where we are in discussion is we're engaged in discussion.
We always think it's helpful to be engaged in discussion.
So we're engaged in discussion with this government committee that's been pulled together that represents the ministries.
And I think one of the things I mentioned earlier this is probably the first time we've had the opportunity to be truly engaged in a discussion with a group that represents all the ministries all the folks we need to get in the room together.
And that discussion's centered around setting up a comprehensive solution that has a regulatory framework that can sustain the investment in development for future projects.
And that's really the nature of the discussion.
Part of that whole discussion has been also – it's not just us in that discussion.
They've had to bring in – if you think about this and the way we've talked about our investment our future investment in Israel we've talked about ring fencing that about it being tied to financing and project financing and so forth.
So that's lent itself to where some of these folks who would potentially finance some of this type of activity the banks and so forth financial institutions around the world are also weighing in on what it takes to have a sustainable investment climate.
And what are Noble's legal rights in this situation here? Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director</span></strong> I don't think we'll get into that in the call.
We're very comfortable with our position let me just put it that way.
All right.
Thanks.
And we have no other questions at this time.
I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr.
Larson for any additional or closing remarks.
I just want to close by thanking everyone today participating in the call and their overall interest in Noble Energy.
Hope you have a good day.
This does conclude the call.
We thank you for your participation.
