Thanks Meghan and good afternoon everyone.
Thank you for joining us.
Today I'll provide a general overview of our first quarter results and accomplishments and a review of the progress we've made on our financial plan.
Leila will join us for a brief regulatory update and then Jim will provide more details on first quarter results.
Okay let's get started.
Today we announced first quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.76 per share.
These results are solidly in line with our expectations with a return to normal weather providing incremental benefits compared to the first quarter of 2012.
As we described during our last earnings call our focus in 2013 is on successfully executing our plans to control costs continue to improve operational performance and explore growth opportunities in our regulated and competitive businesses.
We expect this strategy to help us address the impact of market conditions and regulatory challenges while positioning our company for long-term growth when the economy and power prices recover.
Another very important objective for 2013 is implementing our financial plan which was structured to improve the balance sheet enhance liquidity and maintain investment-grade credit metrics.
As Jim described in February the plan focuses on reducing debt at our competitive companies primarily FES and Allegheny Energy Supply by about $1.5 billion.
We have made great progress on this front in a very short period of time by successfully executing numerous parts of the plan.
I'll take a minute to walk you through these developments.
In early March we issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes at FirstEnergy Corp.
in an offering that was positively received.
We completed the transaction with a mix of 5- and 10-year notes at very attractive rates of 2.75% and 4.25% respectively.
We then funded tender offers at FE Solutions or FirstEnergy Solutions and Allegheny Supply -- and Allegheny Energy Supply as we repurchased $665 million of outstanding senior notes.
In April we completed the early redemption of $400 million of FES senior notes that were due in 2015.
We also reduced lease debt by about $100 million with the repurchase of certain remaining lessor interests in connection with the 1987 Bruce Mansfield sale-leaseback transaction and expect $90 million of additional lease debt to amortize naturally through the remainder of the year.
In addition in April we issued notice for $235 million of tax exempt bonds which will be repurchased in early June.
Combined these actions will result in a reduction of long-term debt by about $1.5 billion at our competitive businesses.
In addition our Met-Ed subsidiary issued $300 million in senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and used the proceeds to refinance $150 million of maturing debt and reduce short-term borrowings.
Our Ohio utilities filed a registration statement with the SEC to securitize certain deferred costs and this process continues to move forward.
And finally we started discussions with our bank groups to extend the maturity of our existing $5.5 billion credit facilities for another year through May of 2018.
We're also looking to exercise the accordion option which will increase the total size of the facilities to $6 billion.
We expect to complete this process in a few days.
By taking these actions to reduce -- or to refinance short-term borrowings with long-term debt at rates at that are at historic lows we have made solid progress on our financial plan we laid out for this year.
Further we continue to move forward with our plan to sell up to 1 240 megawatts of unregulated noncore hydro generation assets.
We have retained an independent advisor and commenced marketing activities with a goal of completing this process in the second half of the year.
We plan to use the proceeds to complete our debt reduction plans.
Our success with the actions we have already taken particularly the bond deal with FirstEnergy Corp.
means the Harrison transaction while still important to both West Virginia and FirstEnergy Solutions is no longer critical to the successful completion of our financial plan.
Leila will talk more about Harrison in a few minutes.
As we discussed previously we still expect to issue equity later in the year to further strengthen our balance sheet.
We will determine the exact level up to $300 million later in the year as we get more clarity on our other initiatives.
Moving now to an update of our businesses.
With respect to the construction of simple cycle peakers in Eastlake Ohio American Municipal Power has notified us that they do not intend to proceed with the project.
With this development the Eastlake peakers will not be bid into this month's PJM RPM auction for the 2016-2017 period.
Since we already have substantial transmission investments planned to support reliability in this part of the ATSI zone approximately $700 million through 2016 we do not expect AMP's decision to not proceed with the project to have any significant impact on the auction.
We will continue to work with PJM to address the need for any additional transmission projects which would create additional investment opportunities beyond the projects identified through 2016 or in future years to further bolster and support system reliability in that area.
Looking at our distribution deliveries.
As you may recall the first quarter of 2012 was abnormally warm.
Our distribution sales benefit -- benefited from a return to weather that was slightly colder than normal this year.
Jim will provide more details on this topic in a few minutes.
At FirstEnergy Solutions we continue to focus on expanding our retail business strengthening our brand among customers in both new and existing targeted markets and implementing our multichannel sales strategy.
We increased our retail customer base by about 800 000 customers or 42% since March of 2012.
More importantly while sales margins are compressing somewhat as a result of continued pricing pressure our strategy of channel shifting for example moving kilowatt hours from POLR to higher-value retail channels such as mass market and government aggregation continues to help offset the impact of lower market prices.
FirstEnergy Solutions sales book which targets 104 million megawatt hours in 2013 is essentially filled.
While we have had considerable success in building our customer base forward prices as you know have dropped about $10 per megawatt hour from early 2012 and have continued to lag in that same range.
As we continue to see downward pressure on power prices we are adjusting our forward hedging strategy so that sales for future years fall into the lower range of the glide path we have established allowing more opportunities to capture potential improvement in power prices.
Finally with respect to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule or MATS we were granted extensions for compliance through April 2016 in both Pennsylvania and West Virginia for our Hatfield Bruce Mansfield Fort Martin Harrison and Pleasants stations.
These extensions provide for an additional year as I said through April 16 for compliance at these units.
And as we continue to refine our capital expenditures related to MATS we are lowering our estimated costs to approximately $925 million from the $975 million previously reported.
We continue to believe that a focus on our core generation distribution and transmission businesses provides greater flexibility growth opportunities and financial stability than any single standalone business.
And we continue to manage our businesses with a combination of long- and short-term strategies which is helping us weather current market conditions.
We believe that as the economy and power prices improve we are well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities resulting from more robust conditions.
Now I'll turn this over to Leila for a regulatory update.
Thanks Tony.
In February I provided a review of the key regulatory and legislative issues that we will address in 2013.
And today I will update you on the status of several of those matters in Ohio New Jersey and West Virginia.
In Ohio the state senate has introduced legislation reevaluating the aggressive energy efficiency standards that were passed in Senate Bill 221 in 2008.
As you may know Ohio investor-owned utilities including FirstEnergy must achieve annual compliance targets ultimately resulting in a 22% reduction in electric consumption by 2025.
In light of rising program costs as well as the changing economic landscape since Senate Bill 221 was passed the Senate Public Utilities Committee is evaluating whether changes should be made to the existing law.
FirstEnergy is actively involved in this process and is advocating changes that we believe make more sense for our customers and help foster solid economic growth in Ohio including the development of shale gas.
Also in Ohio we continue to participate in a proceeding at the PUCO regarding the alternative energy rider that recovers our costs associated with procurement of renewable energy credits required under Ohio's renewable energy portfolio standard.
A decision is expected in the second or third quarter of 2013.
With regard to our pending rate case in New Jersey the Board of Public Utilities established a generic proceeding to review the prudence of certain storm costs.
By July 1 2013 JCP&amp;L is expected to file a detailed report of its storm costs for which it intends to seek recovery from ratepayers.
On April 4 2013 JCP&amp;L filed a motion with the BPU requesting that the commission reconsider its March 20 order and rule that the company's cost in response to major storm events will be reviewed and considered in the pending base rate case and not be considered in the generic proceeding.
In the alternative JCP&amp;L requested that the BPU issue an order clarifying the procedures and processes that the BPU will apply to coordinate the generic proceeding with the base rate case to enable recovery of the costs for the major storm event.
Such coordination would include holding the base rate case in abeyance pending conclusion of the generic proceeding.
We expect the commission to rule on our motion in May.
Hearings are currently scheduled in the base rate case from mid-September through mid-November.
Turning now to West Virginia.
On April 23 we received FERC authorization for the proposed Harrison/Pleasants transaction to transfer nearly 1 500 megawatts from our competitive operations to our Mon Power subsidiary.
We await approval from FERC of our filing related to financing for the transaction.
At the same time we continue to work through the state regulatory process.
On April 26 various parties filed their testimony.
Rebuttal testimony is due by May 17 and hearings are scheduled from May 29 through May 31.
We believe the proposed transaction is good for the state of West Virginia as it is expected to help ensure reliable power for our West Virginia utility customers for many years to come.
The proposed transaction is and remains very positive for the West Virginia economy and our customers of our utilities in West Virginia.
Thank you for your time.
Now I will hand the call over to Jim for a review of the first quarter results.
Thanks Leila.
Let's go ahead and get started with a review of the first quarter.
You may want to turn to the consolidated report as I walk through our results.
Looking at the first quarter of 2013 non-GAAP earnings were $0.76 per share while GAAP results were $0.47 per share.
In the first quarter of 2012 non-GAAP earnings were $0.82 per share while GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share.
As Tony mentioned our non-GAAP earnings were solidly in line with our expectations for the first quarter with some incremental benefit year-over-year due to colder weather.
On Page 4 of the consolidated report you can find a list of special items that make up the difference between the GAAP and the non-GAAP results.
The largest of these special items is $0.18 per share in debt redemption cost related to the debt reduction efforts at FES and Allegheny Energy Supply.
Other special items for the first quarter of 2013 include regulatory charges of $0.04 per share a decrease of $0.03 per share related to merger accounting for the commodity contracts plant deactivation cost of $0.01 per share a decrease of $0.01 per share from impacts of the sale or impairment of noncore assets a decrease of $0.01 per share related to mark-to-market adjustments and trust securities impairment of $0.01 per share.
Let's turn now to distribution delivery which increased earnings by $0.07 per share.
Overall deliveries increased 979 000 megawatt hours or about 3% primarily due to weather that was significantly cooler than the same period last year and slightly cooler than normal.
Residential deliveries increased by 6% quarter-over-quarter again primarily due to the impact of weather while commercial and industrial deliveries increased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2012.
To put the impact of weather in perspective heating degree days were 30% higher than in 2012 but only 2% above normal.
When we adjust deliveries for the impact of the extra day in 2012 due to leap year first quarter 2013 sales in the industrial class were up 1.5% quarter-over-quarter.
Sales increased in both the chemicals and refinery segments but were down overall in steel and automotive.
One of the bright spots we see is certain customers within the steel sector are starting to fill increased orders for pipe used in shale gas drilling with expectations for increased usage continuing through the year.
Adjusting for both leap year and the swing in weather first quarter 2013 sales were down 2% in residential and 1% in commercial.
Sales in these classes continue to remain weak.
We also took a look at residential sales over the longer period to see if there were any identifiable trends.
That analysis revealed that since 2007 our residential customer count and usage has been relatively flat.
Commercial and industrial sales are still down versus 2007 at 6% and 8% respectively.
Looking at other first quarter drivers earnings also benefited by a total of $0.05 per share from the combination of lower operations and maintenance expense a lower effective income tax rate and lower general taxes.
These gains were offset by higher depreciation expense of $0.02 per share and lower regulated transmission earnings of $0.02 per share consistent with our expectations due to a lower rate base at TrAIL the Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line Company and lower net system peak demand.
Finally I'd like to provide additional detail on commodity margin at our competitive business which reduced earnings by $0.14 per share compared to the first quarter of 2012.
While we continue to successfully execute our retail strategy gains from this initiative were offset by lower revenues related to historically low PJM capacity prices which reduced earnings by $0.19 per share.
These prices will remain in the range of $16 to $28 per megawatt day through May 2014 as a result of the auctions held during the recession years of 2009 and 2010.
As we have noted previously subsequent auctions in 2011 and 2012 resulted in prices that are substantially higher above $100 per megawatt day for the period of June 2014 through May 2016.
This drop in capacity prices should have resulted in a drop of about $6 per megawatt hour in our overall competitive rate.
However our actual decrease was just $3 per megawatt hour pointing to the benefits of our channel-shifting strategy and our average retail rate of $54 per megawatt hour is consistent with the expectations we laid out with our 2013 earnings guidance.
So we're right on target with where we said we would be.
Excluding the impact of the lower capacity revenues commodity margin for the quarter was up $0.05 per share year-over-year.
Overall contract sales revenue in our competitive operations increased 4% or $0.09 per share.
Looking at each of our channels the continued successful expansion into Illinois drove a 36% increase in governmental aggregation sales during the quarter.
Mass market sales driven by growth in Pennsylvania and Ohio increased 46% with the introduction of several new marketing campaigns.
Structured sales increased 92% due to increased municipal cooperative and bilateral sales.
Direct sales to large- and medium-sized commercial and industrial customers increased 7% primarily due to higher sales in central and southern Ohio.
And finally POLR sales continued to decrease consistent with our retail strategy to realign our sales portfolio.
The successful growth in our retail sales resulted in a 4% increase in total generation output and capacity factors of 73% at our supercritical and 54% at our subcritical units compared to 65% and 24% respectively at those units last year.
With this additional generation output came higher fuel consumption.
Although the fuel rate is also in line with our expectations.
Our retail sales growth also resulted in increased purchase power and transmission expenses and lower wholesale sales.
Commodity margin was also impacted by lower sales of renewable energy credits and lower capacity expenses compared to the first quarter of 2012.
Overall we are pleased with the quarter's results and also with the progress we're making in the implementation of our financial plan for the year.
We plan to continue to strengthen our balance sheet while also looking for additional opportunities to reduce our costs.
Most importantly we are positioning the company to take advantage of opportunities created by expanded competitive markets and improved economic conditions.
Now I'll open the call to your questions.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dan Eggers of Crédit Suisse.
Research Division</strong> Hey just following up on Tony's comments and Leila's comments about Harrison.
Can you just maybe help us understand how important it is you think at this point in time to move that asset over from a balance-sheet perspective relative to a customer-benefit perspective? And then given kind of the wide -- or the low bid made in the intervenor testimony how important is it to take a lower price or accept a lower price to get this done relative to keeping it at FES if the pricing doesn't make sense? Yes well I'll start off with that Dan.
Well let me start off.
I think the low price of the $565 million or whatever is that's just a nonstarter.
So I'll leave that at that.
From a balance-sheet perspective we think we're in pretty good shape by getting the FirstEnergy Corp.
bond deal down where we upsized it to $1.5 billion.
And we also feel we're in a very good position with the hydro sales so we feel real comfortable about that.
And as you know we plan to infuse equity from FirstEnergy down into Mon Power associated with this asset transfer.
If the asset transfer doesn't go forward we would likely infuse that equity that we have planned for Mon Power down into FES.
So I think we'd end up at a good position for the balance sheet there at FES.
Yes Dan this is Tony.
As I'm looking at this I think this is far more important to West Virginia and Mon Power in terms of providing them with a stable and long-term resource that they can rely on than it is at this point from a balance sheet standpoint at FES or FirstEnergy.
Research Division</strong> But if it didn't transfer you'd feel comfortable keeping that extra capacity at FES? Absolutely.
It's a great asset.
So that's not a consideration.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then I guess on RPM outlook I know you guys have kind of signaled Donny I think of kind of flattish in prior comments.
With the clarity on the DR rules and the AMP project not going through is there any change in your thought process? Give me that again Dan because I was talking the same time you were.
Research Division</strong> Oh I'm sorry.
I was just going to ask Donny since last -- he said prior that RPM expectations were relatively flat or that's kind of where you thought it was going to come.
Just curious if you had any updated thoughts now that we have the DR rule clarification out of FERC and the decision on the AMP project not going forward.
I really haven't changed my opinion here Dan.
We'll see here in a couple of weeks obviously where the auction comes out.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then just one last question on industrial load.
I mean you said that you're seeing signs that steel was looking better.
The first quarter had pretty good demand growth.
Are you reevaluating what you guys think normalized load growth is going to be at this point Tony or is this just a little early? Dan I think it's a little early.
It's still spotty.
We're seeing real strength right now in steel and in chemicals and there is absolutely a lot of upside if we can get this manufacturing and further development of the shale gas plays really into an economic development engine for this area.
But I think it still too early to say because some of the other things are not as strong.
Automotive's down a little bit but the fact of the matter is there's been a number of announced projects that as they go forward should provide some upside on the industrial sales side.
So right now I'm cautiously optimistic that we're going to start seeing the economy improve and begin to see some of the expected real growth that can occur in this area as a real energy center for America.
The next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Research Division</strong> Just a quick one.
So the use of proceeds if you are successful in Harrison and hydro because you've already hit your delevering targets at FES I think with this new deal in April should we just assume more of the same or something different? We would use those proceeds Jonathan to pay down some of the short-term borrowings that we have there right now associated with paying down the debt.
Research Division</strong> At FES? That's correct.
The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.
Research Division</strong> So just following up on Dan's question a little bit here.
With regards to ATSI specifically what do you expect there in '16 '17 just to be explicit? I expect to get the results about May 24 I think is the date.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
Fair enough.
And again kind of following up on a little granular detail here the energy efficiency component of the Ohio program recently approved.
As of today what is the total megawatts that you're seeing come out of that program that you'd expect to bid? Roughly right now we're expecting a delta from what we maybe would have put in versus what the commission order would require us to do I assume that's what you're getting at of roughly 160 megawatts.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And again broadly speaking if you could summarize not to put it too cutely here.
But a lot of other peers of yours have framed upside to power forwards in a dollar-per-megawatt-hour fashion.
I'd be curious if you guys would be willing to opine using a comparable metric out in '15 or '16 or what have you? I think it's always interesting.
I've heard what they've said in the main and I don't really have any reason to say otherwise.
I think there's going to be a lot more generation removed from both the energy and capacity markets as we go forward.
That will bring the demand -- the supply side more in balance over time.
I'm not sure that that's fully reflected yet in the forward prices that we're seeing out there.
And on the demand side we're certainly hopeful that by the time we move into these time frames there is more robust economic activity than we've seen here recently.
So a combination of demand and supply as it naturally would affect prices we would expect to see some upside.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then maybe just last one here.
How does that fit into your hedging strategy here? I mean you talked about being in the lower range of the glide path et cetera.
Again it just means that we're going to hold some sales back to take advantage of higher energy prices as they materialize in time because we truly believe that they are going to rise.
And therefore we're going to slow down the amount of otherwise contracting we would do into forward periods.
[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
Research Division</strong> I wonder if you could talk a little about the process you're going through with PJM given the Eastlake peaker decision.
Is there anything we should be looking for in the near term in terms of the assessment of further transmission needed? If for example anything that might come out before the auction or any other discussion from PJM as to shortfalls in the ASTI zone or anything else we should be looking for I guess at PJM? I'd say at this point probably you shouldn't be looking for anything in the near term.
Remembering that the '15 '16 auction did not clear the peaking unit at -- in that area transmission requirements were put in place to address those concerns as well as RMR agreements or RM whatever -- RMR agreements which should cover that period.
I would expect by the time that we get to the '16 and '17 time frame and beyond is where people would begin looking at whether or not any additional transmission's required.
So I'm not expecting anything near term.
Research Division</strong> Understood.
And just wanted to follow-up on Dan's question on the credit.
I just want to make sure that I understood the message there.
As I understand it the message is that you have -- you've done quite a bit of refinancing and work there.
You have hydro assets that you can sell and you may or may not issue up to $300 million of equity.
And as you look at that that puts you in a position to be able to maintain your credit position.
Is that fair? Yes I would say that was fair Stephen.
And one of the things I said to the earlier question of -- on the FES side specifically is if the Harrison asset transfer goes through then we will use those proceeds to continue our debt reduction there.
If that transaction would not go forward then the money that we had targeted to infuse from FirstEnergy holding company down to Mon Power we could use those proceeds to infuse down into FirstEnergy Solutions bolster their equity and give them those proceeds to pay down debt.
The next question is from Neel Mitra of Tudor Pickering.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.
Research Division</strong> As we look at FE holdco now that you've raised enough debt that you can deleverage enough at FES what are the factors that we should look at to see whether you're going to kind of use the full $300 million? I guess what are the puts and takes that would decide whether you would decide to use that? And what would it be used for the full $300 million? Well I would say the primary thing that we'll be looking at Neel would be the hydro asset sale when we get that completed and how successful we are there.
But as we said we do plan to issue equity sometime towards the end of the year and it would be up to $300 million.
So I'd say the key benchmark to be looking at would be the hydro sale.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.
Research Division</strong> Great.
And then now that I guess we've seen a run up in '13 gas how have your coal plants been running? Are the capacity factors higher now that we're seeing higher dark spreads than last year? Yes I think we said that the critical units were running around 74%.
We probably have that number right there.
Yes Page 12 of the consolidated report.
The base load units were at 73% capacity factor versus last year at 65%.
Our next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.
Just a few quick ones on the AMP Ohio deal.
As I recall there was some sort of transmission offset in terms of CapEx.
I'm just wondering the kind of CapEx savings that you might be seeing because of this? And if you could just give me a little bit more clarity as to why it doesn't impact the RPM? Is that because of other things like the energy efficiency ruling or something else? Well I think on the first part of your question Paul I think we originally said that the transmission spend was going to be several hundred million dollars higher absent building this plant.
But we'll have discussions with PJM and that additional spend is not likely to incur -- to occur until after 2016.
And it could be as late as 2019 or '20.
So I think that's the answer there.
As far as impacting the capacity auction as Tony said the '15 '16 auction did not include AMP and so the changes between '15 and '16 and '16 and '17 will be on what PJM's assessment is on demand growth what happens with DR and if there's any new generation.
So...
Okay.
I see what you're saying.
So you were talking about relative to last year the fact that -- Okay I got you.
It wasn't there before so is that what you mean? Okay I didn't...
Yes.
Sorry to be slow on that.
Okay.
So just the energy efficiency ruling what's the number of megawatts that's associated with that? Hi Paul.
This is Leila.
Roughly a delta of 160 megawatts.
Okay.
And then just on this transmission side the net system peak seemed to impact you guys and I was wondering sort of if you could elaborate a little on that.
It sounds like weather and sales are sort of higher in the territory and stuff.
I was just wondering what that net system peak demand reduction what that signified versus...
That isn't for the current year.
That's set on prior years' net peak demand.
And I think that was actually for the end of '10 beginning of '11 where that peak was maybe from July 1 2010 through June 30 or May 31 of '11.
So that peak demand has -- deals with prior periods.
It has nothing to do with this current year.
Our next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Questions both on the regulated side of the house and on the nonregulated side.
I just wanted to double check the time line.
When do you expect new rates per the general rate case in New Jersey for JCP&amp;L? When do those go in effect? Michael I'll let Leila jump in on this.
But at this point we have various things in front of the commission.
It's the generic proceeding on the storm costs.
We also have filed for a base rate increase and we've asked the commission to consider the storm costs as part of our base rate proceeding.
But at this point we would not expect that rates would go into effect until probably the first or second quarter of 2014.
We have our -- currently we have hearings scheduled for the September through the November time frame.
So it's not likely we will hear anything until early next year.
And Michael this is Leila.
Just to add a little bit to that.
Should they want to go forward with the generic proceedings and allow the results to flow into the rate case it would offset the timing that Jim just laid out by a month or 2.
I would imagine it would be a manageably short period of time.
So that can get elongated a little bit.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
And then one question on the balance sheet.
Just what kind of feedback have you gotten from the rating agencies regarding just total consolidated leverage metrics.
You've done a really good job of reducing debt at FES but so far pre the asset sales it seems that you've just simply added debt at the holding company to reduce debt at FES.
I'm just curious what kind of feedback the rating agencies have provided on consolidated debt metrics? Well they came out with a report I believe it was in the February timeframe where they gave a report on FirstEnergy consolidated.
We've shared our plan with them.
I think they're waiting to see the success of some of the financial initiatives that we've laid out as well as the outcome in the Jersey rate proceedings.
So I think they're waiting to see the end results of all of those.
But we've fed them all of the information and we're in active dialogue with them.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And then last item.
If I look at Page 13 in the release where you show kind of all your contract sales and your wholesale sales.
One thing that stands out a little bit is just -- and I know your total megawatt hours sold has gone up year-over-year but so has your purchase power level especially your spot purchase power.
Meaning your total purchase power is up almost 2 terawatt hours year-over-year your spot purchase power is I don't know up 1.7 and change.
Just curious about kind of risk management and how far in advance you procure those spot megawatt hours.
I'm just trying to think about exposure kind of exposure to future volatility in spot power prices for -- to purchase power to supply your retail customers.
Michael this is Donny.
It depends on the time frame in which we need those purchases.
Obviously if it's a summertime load issue we'll either go out and buy -- we'll buy forwards or we'll buy call options to cover that.
And if it's associated with the shoulder months which is sometimes more likely believe it or not because we'll have units on scheduled outages we'll let some of that ride in the spot market not a large percentage of it but we'll let some of it ride.
We're very comfortable with being able to procure power to serve load.
For years prior to our merger with Allegheny we served all of the Penelec and Met-Ed load.
I think that in total was about 30 terawatt hours a year and we did all -- almost all of with purchased power.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
But how does that flow through? Let's say this summer you're buying power in the spot market to serve your retail load and for some reason there's -- someone else has planned outages and there's a spike a $10 or $15 increase per megawatt hour.
How does that impact retail margins? And how does it impact -- I'm just trying to think about the exposure to volatility kind of week over week or month over month in power prices.
And I don't mean kind of the $1 or $2 dollar movements.
I mean like we saw in New England this past winter where you saw major movements in the short-term pricing.
Yes I think that the short answer is Michael we would not leave ourselves that exposed.
We're going to -- if we're into the summer months and it's on-peak power requirements we're going to cover that up with a combination of forwards and calls.
Research Division</strong> Got it.
So it's safe to assume by like a May June time frame you've probably locked up the summer requirements unless the demand is ridiculously hot in which case other parts of your business would benefit.
Absolutely.
Even earlier than May and June.
The next question is from Charles Fishman of MorningStar.
Research Division</strong> If you do have a lower glide path on your contract sales will that change your strategy as far as how quickly you reduce your POLR sales over the next few years? Charles I don't -- this is Donny by the way.
We generally use POLR sales almost as a plug if you will depending on how our other sales are going and obviously we also take a look at how competitive that POLR sale is.
So they could be related that if we've slowed down and we've become more selective around our retail sales and a good opportunity comes along in the POLR market we may step into that little stronger.
But it would really depend on what the competitors were doing in that particular auction at the time.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
So I guess what I'm hearing is they're not as directly related as maybe I thought.
No.
No they're not directly related.
The next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.
Research Division</strong> I had to jump off and on so I'm not sure if you went over it.
If you did I apologize.
But your latest thoughts on Signal Peak? Signal Peak it's producing very well.
I think we're into the third long wall move.
I think probably beginning next year we'll start on the surface mining.
So at this point it's performing very well.
We're getting low cost out of the mine production's increasing.
And I would say ultimately we would look to sell the asset.
We've said that that's not a business that we want to be in long term.
But it's not one of the assets that we're focused on right now.
Research Division</strong> What is long term? I would say probably within the next 5 years.
Our next question is from Greg Gordon of ISI Group.
Research Division</strong> Just on the idea of hedging and you being sort of at the low end of your sort of hedge channel versus the high end.
I just went back and pulled up your last Analyst Day presentation where you present sort of a visual guide to how you think about hedging.
So is it fair to say looking at that that for 2014 then given where you are this time of year that you'd be about 55% to 60% sold forward at this point? Yes that's about right Greg.
Research Division</strong> So the rest of it's open and can either be sold wholesale or into POLR? That's correct.
And the final question comes from Raymond Leung of Goldman Sachs.
Research Division</strong> Can we talk a little about one provide me a quick update on securitization I think the Ohio units have something.
Can you provide some time line on that? And then also you mentioned the potential equity injection related to the asset transfer for Harrison or otherwise injecting equity down to FES.
Can you sort of provide me some context of what the source of funds would be? And then the last thing also can you talk a little bit more about the bank line extension and the accordion feature? Can you just discuss that a little bit more? Is that just a $0.5 billion incremental if you use the accordion feature? Let me take that since I was last one Ray.
Yes our bank credit facilities we expect to close that in the very near term and we're going to extend that out by 1 year through May of 2018.
And yes the accordion feature will be for $500 million and that will at the corp.
level.
As far as the securitization we've filed our registration statement.
We've got comments back from the SEC.
We're in the process of responding to those comments.
And my expectation that in the very near future we'll be ready to take that to market.
Research Division</strong> And what the use of proceeds would be for securitization? Well that would be to buyback debt at Ohio Edison Cleveland and Toledo Edison.
Research Division</strong> Okay.
And my last question on source of funds for the equity injection.
Yes the source of funds as we had always said from the Mon Power asset transfer we would infuse equity into Mon Power from FE Corp.
So we went out we raised $1.5 billion so it would be funds that were sitting there at FE Corp.
And instead of pushing those down to Mon Power we could push them down to FES if we need be.
