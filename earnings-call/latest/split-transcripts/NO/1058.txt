Good morning and welcome to the Noble Energy's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call.
At this time I would like to turn the conference over to our host Mr.
David Larson.
Please go ahead sir.
Thanks Joshua.
Good morning everyone.
I'm glad you could join us today for Noble Energy's first quarter 2015 earnings call and webcast.
This morning we issued our earnings release and also posted to our website a few supplement slides for this call.
Later this morning our 10-Q will be available.
Following the remarks by Dave Stover we'll open the call for Q&amp;A with the executive team and wrap things up in less than an hour.
Finally I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements as well as references non-GAAP financial measures.
You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those.
With that let me turn the call over to Dave.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thank you David.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.
I'm extremely pleased with how Noble Energy has performed in the early part of 2015.
This is highlighted by our production which has been strong across the board.
And while still early we're confident enough to raise our full-year volume outlook.
Our successes also include improving capital efficiency and reducing operating costs.
The results so far this year are right where we expected if not a little better.
Another major accomplishment was gaining alignment with our partner in the Marcellus to reduce our activity levels.
And in the DJ Basin strong results and continued operational efficiencies are driving additional capital allocation in the second half of the year.
Starting off with sales volumes we sold a record 318 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter an increase of 17% over the same period last year after adjusting for asset sales.
Full year sales are now expected to average between 300 000 and 315 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as we have raised the bottom end of our range by 5 000 barrels equivalent per day.
This updated range now reflects the first quarter outperformance while maintaining our prior expectations for remaining quarters of the year.
Compared to the first quarter of last year core U.S.
onshore sales volumes increased more than 35% driven by record production in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale.
Horizontal production in these two plays was up a combined 60% versus the same time period.
Offshore including the Gulf of Mexico and our international businesses volumes were relatively flat with the first quarter of last year after adjusting for asset sales.
Our offshore assets continue to perform very well with world-class runtime and lower than expected decline rate.
Highlighting this performance is nearly 100% runtime at both Tamar offshore Israel and Aseng in Equatorial Guinea.
It's the combination of these high quality low cost assets and managing a diversified portfolio that continues to provide Noble a competitive advantage.
Our U.S.
onshore development major project execution and exploration capabilities provide material resource opportunities and tremendous investment optionality.
As mentioned earlier we've made substantial progress towards lowering both our capital and operating costs.
We've worked closely with our suppliers to achieve an average of 20% savings seen most prominently in our U.S.
onshore business.
Our suppliers have moved quickly to assist in adjusting our cost structure and we continue to work with them in partnership to ensure these early achievements are turned into sustainable cost improvements.
Highlighting our production cost reduction was lease operating expense which is already down $0.50 per barrel from the fourth quarter a material change in such a short period of time and putting us on track to meet our full-year average expectation.
General and administrative costs are down from previous quarters as well.
We've also recently completed an organizational realignment which better positions our workforce for this current environment.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were a little over $900 million slightly below our internal expectations and trending lower as we move through the year.
Total capital for 2015 remains $2.9 billion with $1.8 billion allocated to the onshore U.S.
business.
The DJ Basin has increased to more than 60% of the onshore U.S.
amount with Marcellus now representing slightly less than 40%.
Focusing on our DJ operations growth in the first quarter exhibited our strong operating capacity.
Total volumes were a record 116 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day up 22% versus the first quarter last year.
Growth in the horizontal program is even more impressive up more than 50% over the last year and more than 110% in the last two years.
Slide four highlights continued drilling efficiencies being delivered by our teams.
And as you can see we're now averaging seven days from spud to rig release for a standard lateral length well almost as fast as we used to drill vertical wells.
In fact we recently drilled a 9 300-foot horizontal well in Wells Ranch in just seven days.
Compared to last year we're drilling 70% of the total footage while utilizing 40% of the rig count.
This is a result of our focus on drilling execution utilizing the best rigs and crews in the Basin and continuing to increase our average lateral lengths per well.
Reduced drilling times are resulting in an increased number of wells that can be completed this year and we're reallocating some capital here to keep up with the drilling pace supplementing our one full-time completion crew with a second completion crew in the second half of the year.
These efficiencies along with supplier cost reductions are driving a downward trend in our well costs.
Based on today's drilling and completion costs we're already meeting our budgeted well cost expectations for the year.
We have highlighted on slide five a $3.8 million Wells Ranch well.
Our overall cost reductions from 2014 include 5% to 15% sustainable cost savings from continuing to reduce drilling times and optimizing equipment usage and a range of 15% to 25% savings from our major suppliers.
It is worth noting that these well costs are all-in and include items such as pad construction and associated facilities cost.
And we have opportunities to continue to drive costs down further.
Using slickwater for fracs in certain parts of the Basin may allow us to save an additional $100 000 to $200 000 per well on a standard length lateral.
We recently brought online 11 wells in East Pony that were completed with slickwater and these wells are performing at or above expectations.
Third-party infrastructure uptime improved at the start of the year and I am pleased with the progress of the expansion projects that are currently underway.
The Lucerne-2 plant and additional compressor stations are on track for startup in late second quarter providing a material increase in processing and compression capacity on the DCP system.
The Grand Parkway low-pressure loop has been approved and is expected to start up by the end of the year which will have a positive impact on the performance of legacy vertical wells and earlier horizontal wells.
Operating performance in the Marcellus Shale remains exceptional as well.
And our production grew 73% versus the first quarter of last year to nearly 400 million cubic feet equivalent per day.
Similar to the DJ Basin we're seeing substantial reduction in drilling times and lower well costs through a combination of utilizing top hole rigs drilling longer laterals and supplier cost reductions.
Improvements in drilling times have resulted in a larger inventory of uncompleted wells than we had originally anticipated in both the operated and non-operated areas of the Marcellus.
This affords us the opportunity to reduce rig count in the second half of the year to one operated rig and two non-operated rigs while still meeting our planned completion and production goals.
Overall this is a $200 million net reduction to our prior Marcellus expectations.
We continue to diversify our natural gas markets and recently began transporting approximately 100 million cubic feet per day of gas out of the Basin including our first sales into Gulf Coast markets.
This firm transportation has a relatively low overall cost and gives us further access to better-priced markets.
Moving offshore we achieved a number of key milestones on our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter.
At Rio Grande all drilling and completion operations are now complete and pipeline installation is scheduled to begin in the second quarter.
Rio Grande remains on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter.
Development drilling operations at Gunflint are underway and are expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015.
Pipeline installation will commence following the Rio Grande installation and first production from Gunflint remains on schedule for mid-2016.
Our Gulf of Mexico projects highlight the benefits of our diverse portfolio by providing strong oil growth exiting 2015 with another step-up in 2016.
The cash margins for these projects are very competitive with U.S.
onshore resource plays evidenced by nearly all of the production being oil and priced at a premium to WTI combined with attractive production costs.
Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean Tamar continues to exhibit exceptional reliability and set new milestones for delivery achieving a record weekly gross sales average of over 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day driven by seasonal demand and coal plant maintenance.
Our recently signed agreement to supply interruptible sales of up to 250 million cubic feet per day gross from Tamar to Egypt's domestic market is another example of the strong regional demand for our natural gas.
We and our customer are now working to finalize regulatory approvals and transportation agreements needed to start sales.
We believe these can be concluded in the next few months setting us up for initial sales later in 2015 by utilizing existing infrastructure.
Once we have those approvals we will provide an outlook for sales and adjust our production guidance at that time.
During the first quarter we received regulatory approval for export sales to the Arab Potash Company and Jordan Bromine Company in Jordan.
While relatively small volume this does represent the first formally approved regional export of natural gas from Israel and sets forward a path for additional agreements to follow.
Meanwhile we continue to work very intently to establish a comprehensive framework for energy development.
Our teams are meeting regularly with the inter-ministerial group established by the Prime Minister's office for this purpose and we're encouraged by their efforts to create a sustainable investment climate for energy development in Israel.
Early progress has been made and we look forward to working with the new government.
Resolution about standing regulatory matters including anti-trust concerns and export taxation along with a comprehensive framework for energy development is still necessary to enable additional project development.
We believe the inter-ministerial working group is on track to achieve this objective over the next few months following the seating of the new government.
In Cyprus we're working closely with the government and plan to submit a preliminary field development plan in the near future.
Our Cyprus discovery can be another important contributor toward meeting regional gas demand.
We've begun export marketing activities and are greatly encouraged by the level of interest expressed by potential counterparties not only for gas purchases but also regarding participating in export infrastructure investment.
Also within our offshore business you can certainly feel the exploration excitement around our office as we're nearing a very impactful 2015 drilling program.
In West Africa we recently signed a rig contract for the Cheetah exploration prospect in Cameroon and expect this low cost well to spud early in the third quarter.
Cheetah represents our first Cretaceous test in the Douala Basin and has a mean resource size in excess of 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross.
A sizeable discovery at Cheetah would deliver a very attractive development in less than 100 feet of water depth where we can move very quickly to first production.
By the end of the second quarter we anticipate commencing drilling offshore in the Falkland Islands where we plan to drill two exploration wells this year.
Our first prospect Humpback which we operate with a 35% interest has a gross mean resource size of over 250 million barrels of oil.
If successful Humpback would de-risk other large prospects shown on slide 10 that have cumulative gross resource potential in excess of 1 billion barrels of oil.
We recently farmed into the Rhea prospect also with 250 million barrels of oil potential which will be our second exploration well in the Falkland Islands.
Adding the Rhea opportunity further diversifies our exploration inventory and enhances our overall chance of success as it offsets other oil discoveries in the Basin.
The prospect is anticipated to spud by year-end.
We operate Rhea and currently have a 75% working interest.
Let me now provide some insight into our volume profile throughout the year.
As mentioned earlier we have not made any production guidance changes to the remaining quarters.
Second quarter sales volumes are anticipated to range between 290 000 and 300 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day impacted by planned facility maintenance and turnarounds in West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico along with the usual seasonal demand softness for Israel volumes.
From there sales are expected to build in the second half of the year with strong seasonal demand in Israel in the third quarter followed by new oil volumes from the start-up of our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter.
Our diversified portfolio is setting us up to exit 2015 on a nice trajectory.
So in summary we're off to a strong start this year.
Performance on volumes capital efficiency and costs is where we expected if not a little better – not a little bit better at this point.
And we're on a path approaching cash flow neutrality around mid-year as we anticipated.
So Joshua at this time we'd like to go ahead and open the call to questions.
Thank you so much sir.
We'll take our first question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Hi.
Good morning guys.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning.
You guys delivered impressive efficiencies – drilling efficiencies in Wattenberg and Eagle Ford in the first quarter.
I guess two questions.
What do you see is the scope there to improve efficiencies further? And secondly how are you planning to preserve those efficiencies as activity increases in their off-cycle? It would appear that's more of a secular benefit than cyclical like service cost benefits you're enjoying today.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well Evan it's good to point out that the efficiencies are continuing to improve and I don't think we're done there.
I'll have Gary Willingham talk a little bit about his view up there.
But I've been extremely impressed and pleased with what the team has done by concentrating on each aspect of the drilling cycle if you will.
I mean if you think about it now we've actually drilled long laterals in the same time that we used to drill vertical wells four to five years ago.
So it's been a remarkable improvement.
But I'll let Gary talk about what he sees as far as trajectory this year.
Operations</span></strong> Yeah Evan when you look at the slide on page four you can see the improvement over time and especially focusing on that spud to rig release curve how that's continued to come down over time.
So we were able to do that even in a much higher commodity price environment obviously.
I think some of the recent performance improvement we've seen to be fair is we're running four rigs and we tended to keep the four best rigs out of the 10 but I think that's a fairly small part of the improvement that we've seen.
Most of it comes from just a continuing focus on how can we make each little part of the drilling process better? And as Dave mentioned while we average seven days for normal length laterals in the first quarter in the DJ we also drilled a 9 300-foot well in seven days.
And we also drilled a normal length lateral well in five days in East Pony so that gives us confidence that there's still more improvement to come and that's what we'll be chasing over the next quarters.
Great.
And my second question given you and CNX have reduced activity in the Marcellus how do you consider reallocating capital in the Niobrara beyond the completion crew added? And just maybe more broadly many companies have cited various approaches into a commodity price recovery with some looking to balance sheet repair earlier adding rigs in the back half of the year.
How do you anticipate responding in an improved commodity price environment? I'll leave it there.
Operations</span></strong> I mean for now for 2015 we're really still looking at just four rigs.
So the capital that we're shifting from the Marcellus to the DJ we're using that to kind of back-end load those four rigs that we've already got because again we're drilling wells a lot faster.
So that kind of back-end loads those rigs and provides for a few more completions this year.
Most of those completions incremental completions will be in 2016.
And then that's regardless of what the commodity looks like in the back half of the year so you're pretty set for this year or is it responsive or reflective of that environment? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
I'd say at this point it's too early to change anything for the year.
I mean the one change that you've noted is that we brought down the capital spending working with our partner in the Marcellus.
And then as Gary pointed out with the efficiencies of these four rigs and just assuming we stay at four rigs this year in the DJ we're going to drill more wells and now we're going to allocate more money to completion so we'll come out of the year putting ourselves in I'd say even a better position heading into 2016 there.
Great.
I appreciate the color guys.
Thanks.
And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thanks.
Good morning everyone.
Good morning David.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hey Doug.
A couple of questions if I may.
There's a comment in the press release about the efficiency gains in the DJ will result in more wells this year than perhaps you originally planned.
So I guess I've got two questions around that.
One is why continue to drill in this – I guess it's an improving environment we're in but why continue to drill when some of your peers have been starting completions? So what's your take on that? And secondly how does it change the mix of those incremental wells between long laterals and I guess your standard length wells? And I've got a quick follow-up please.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
And I'll start with that.
But I'd say where we are right now and as Gary has pointed out we continue to get more and more efficient with these four rigs than I would expect.
We continue to see that trend this year so we've kind of got a base load of operation now between what we're focusing on at East Pony and Wells Ranch with this rig activity with this four-rig activity.
And what it's enabling us to do now is to bring more wells ready for – more wells that we'll have drilled by the end of the year is more wells ready to complete by the end of the year which I think will give us some very nice momentum as we exit this year and look towards 2016.
So it just gives us a lot more capacity of what we can do there as we continue to gain efficiency.
And I think that part of that efficiency is driven by focusing on this continued improvement with these four rigs and with these dedicated crews that we have up there.
Gary another view? Operations</span></strong> Yeah.
And I think the only thing I would add to your point on how does it change the mix of ERLs.
We've been looking at increasing our spud count this year by probably about 15% in the DJ.
I think those incremental wells that will be targeted towards year-end will be roughly the same 50% ERLs that we've got in the budget.
But if it's off from that much it's not going to change the annual average that much either way.
Okay.
I appreciate the answer.
Dave my follow-up I guess is a pretty standard question around the regulatory situation in Israel.
I think you'd suggested that post the election things were perhaps looking a little bit more promising in terms of getting going again on Leviathan forward sales and so on.
Any update you can share to the extent you can and I'll leave it at that.
Thank you.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think the main thing while they've been going through their election cycle and pulling the new government together the work has continued behind the scenes with this inter-ministerial committee and I think we've been very pleased with the progress we've seen especially the focus on coming up with what we've talked about this comprehensive solution this kind of roadmap the sanction if you will.
And so I've been very pleased with the progress we've seen and the commitment to getting this thing ready so that we can start back up as things develop here.
And part of the reality of it is the new government is going to have to get in place going to have to get seated but the real positive part of that is nobody is waiting or has been waiting for that.
Everybody has been working diligently to address the things that need to be addressed so you can put this comprehensive framework together.
I can ask Keith.
Keith has been the one here Keith Elliott here that's been more intimately involved with it than me and he can give you his feel for his outlook on that.
Yeah.
I think Doug that the – my sense is that the government through the formation of the inter-ministerial committee is really reflecting the recognition that the establishment of this investment framework that blends itself to companies ourselves and other players new entrants into the Basin providing that sort of stable and attractive investment climate just leads us to be optimistic that they're going to deliver a solution in a reasonable timeframe here.
Guys the sales contracts that you had already are they (24:29) I guess that you'd already signed are they still good and obviously they're on hold but would you be able to go back to those in fairly quick order or have they been completely shelved until you get clarity? We've continued to be engaged with all of those potential customers.
We're engaged with them on an ongoing basis.
The LOIs are either in place or extensions have been agreed.
And all parties really continue to be very prepared to move toward consummation of these contracts once we can get the regulatory framework in place.
I mean I think the thing is that – and Dave alluded to it in his comments the thing that I would just call out is there really is a fundamental supply/demand imbalance that the resources in Israel and Cyprus are – can really lend themselves to help them to address and I think that hasn't been lost on any of the potential buyers.
I appreciate it fellas.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons &amp; Company.
Good morning guys.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good morning Dave.
Real quickly in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you thought the decrease in service costs could be sustained over time.
Can you give us some more color on that specifically to the cost reductions? Not necessarily the efficiency gains.
And are you looking at locking down some of the service costs going forward in the form of contracts or anything like that? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think that gets all back to how we're working with our major service providers.
And I think the way we look at it is – this is a partnership.
It's not about just beating costs down but it's a partnership on how we do we do business not only for now but going forward in a way that we can make this more economical for all of us.
And so a lot of discussion when you look at actually the contracting and a lot of that is on an annual basis on some of our major suppliers.
It can be a little longer than that on some of this.
So we'll put in place some of that but we're looking at the combination of service costs and what else can we do just from improved efficiency on some of this and the combination of those to lock in a lower cost profile if you will for longer term here.
But it's – back to Gary's point earlier it's working on all aspects of that.
Okay.
I appreciate that.
And then one of the things I know I've talked to you guys about in the past but service companies are highlighting and that's the ability to go back and refrac wells which at this juncture some people are posing that that could be a significant driver to higher rates of return obviously for lower capital spending.
How are you guys thinking about that in the Wattenberg at this juncture and how are you studying that currently? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well as you would expect especially up in Wattenberg and the DJ Basin we've had a long history and our predecessors had a long history of utilizing existing wellbores especially in the vertical world where they were – we had been in the mode of refracs and even trifracs.
So there's a lot of history there.
I think in the horizontal world obviously it poses some other complexities if you will with using the long lateral especially on long lateral lengths.
But we did a few up there previously and we've also done a few in the Marcellus.
And I think it's probably going to take a little more time.
The ones we initially did were probably in areas that hadn't performed as well initially though we saw some benefit from that.
The real test will be when we start at some point trying to do this in areas that have had very good results but after three of four years or so like we did in the vertical program you start to look at can you go back in and bust open some more rock and get some more incremental recovery.
I think David it's just part of what's in the toolbox of things we're looking at as to how we take the percent recovery from single-digit to double-digits up there in the Basin and I don't know – Gary anything else on that? Operations</span></strong> I think as Dave said we've done some in both places the Marcellus we did some refracs as well as some re-perforating on some older wells.
And had some very nice results on those where the production rates came back up to actually the initial rates of the wells.
DJ we've done a number.
Results have been a bit more mixed there being able to mechanically isolate the fracs has remained the big issue there.
You've seen a lot of talk recently around different means of diverting.
We've tried some of those.
We're not really ready to comment on the results yet.
We're also working on a couple of other ideas that haven't seen mentioned too much publicly.
So we'll continue to chase a few things.
I think this is something that eventually a lot of smart engineers in the industry will figure out how to fix it and create a whole other wave of opportunity in these fields.
Okay.
Appreciate that.
One last one if I can just sneak it in.
How are you guys thinking about hedging in 2016 at this juncture with the movement we've seen in the forward strip? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> We've got some volume hedged in 2016 I think it's what 25%?.
Yeah.
It's about 29% David.
I think the way – our hedging program has been very successful over time in that we don't – we try to average in so we'll set up a plan rate and then we'll watch the market and go slowly.
So that's allowed us to be well hedged in – through time.
And we've had big hedge settlements in 2009 big positive hedge settlements in 2009 and of course this year and if this – again 2016 depending on how things play out.
At the same time we haven't given up much headroom or had negative settlements of any note.
So the program has been effective and we'll continue to do a current year plus two and typically about 50% of the volume and average in.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I mean we'll continue to look for opportunities and an upswing in commodity market.
But as Ken said the target is 50% on global oil and 50% on U.S.
gas is kind of what we hold ourselves to.
Great.
Really appreciate the additional color there.
Thanks so much guys.
And next we'll move onto Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Good morning everyone.
I wondered if I could ask a question on the DJ.
With the 8% sequential production growth there quarter-over-quarter I think that's the highest we've seen in a while and I'm wondering if you can comment on whether that's maybe the beginning of a trend we see as you kind of unload the spring and get the midstream debottlenecked or maybe if it's more reflective of kind of a reduced operational pace and so kind of reduced offset well shut-ins is – fracs – and if you can kind of give us a sense of the bigger picture there.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Hi Charles.
I appreciate it.
I think it was a big quarter in the DJ obviously.
I think we benefited some from coming off the activity levels late last year which we actually dropped or reduced from 10 rigs late last year into starting this year off – or say starting this year off here in the first quarter moving down to four rigs on that.
So we'll see that change a little bit.
Gary can talk a little bit on how he sees the year playing out as we go through the year and we still have some of the big processing facility to come on here in the end of the second quarter too which will impact things.
Operations</span></strong> Yeah.
I wouldn't attribute any of it really or much of it to lower activity levels and less offset shut-ins with fracs.
As you probably remember a lot of our completions in 2014 were towards the back-end loaded so a lot of wells came on late in 4Q and we certainly got an uplift from that in the first quarter of this year.
We have dropped down from the 10 rigs to the four rigs so we're working off that completion backlog that we brought into the year as well.
I think when you look at our profile through the year we expect to – 1Q to be the highest be fairly flat maybe through first half and then start to decline in the second half as we get back into more of an equilibrium that you would expect with only running the four rigs.
Now what remains to be seen on top of that is how much of an uplift we truly get from the startup of the Lucerne-2 gas plant that DCP is bringing on in June.
That's 200 million cubic feet a day plant we would certainly expect to see some recovery from our legacy program the vertical wells the older horizontal wells from reduced pressures when that plant comes on.
We've got a little bit of that baked into the plan but we could see more than that.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> And don't forget as we talked on the last call we've kind of level loaded our completions here for the year and so as we get more completions later in the year as I mentioned earlier that actually helps us on next year's volume.
Got it.
That makes sense Dave.
And Gary that's good detail on what you guys have kind of – that you have a portion of the Lucerne – portion of I guess I should say the possible Lucerne uplift baked in.
Operations</span></strong> Right.
Dave if I could get you to go back to talk about the Eastern Med and I recognize that maybe you guys don't want to go into too much detail but I'm going to try to see if we can...
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> You're going to push on that...
Maybe get a little more out of you.
But so you've got – I recognize that they haven't seen the new parliament and haven't worked out the new coalition that sort of thing.
But maybe you could talk a bit about how you got this finalized agreement because it seems like – I know this news came out a little bit earlier.
But that to me seems like while it's not a big deal it's an important hurdle that you now have exports approved to go out of the country.
But how did that come together in the absence of a seated parliament and how should we – does that have any implications for what the process looks like for your interruptible Egypt agreement? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Good connection there Charles.
I'd say that yeah even though it is a small volume it is important from the standpoint that it was the first real export agreement.
So we had a chance to work through the process if you will and get some of the kinks out in that process on how you approach that and how you get an approval of that type of thing.
So for that first agreement over there to Jordan.
Probably Keith can expand on that a little bit more since he's been closer to it.
Yeah Charles.
I think with respect to the Arab Potash-Jordan Bromine agreement that you're referring to that really is a result of ongoing engagement with the government really over a period of probably a year year and a half where we've been pursuing the really implementation of the export policy that the government established back in 2012 and 2013 timeframe.
So a number of these things are within the control of specific ministries.
And so this is the case in point where it's completely within the remit of the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources.
Others are more complex that require the alignment across ministries and that's really been the benefit that we've seen of this inter-ministerial working group.
It's caused a number of ministries that typically don't work as closely together as might be needed to create the kind of framework that investors look for.
It's caused – it's provided a venue for those groups to work together and that's been the real positive thing I think that's come out of this for us.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> But I think the second part of your question does it help with setting a pathway for the interruptible contract approval by the government and actually both governments Israel and Egypt for that.
And I think it does help with that and that's one we're continuing to keep our eye on and push because we think that could be another very important milestone if you will in how things are progressing over there.
Right.
Because – and just to sneak this in David because that would establish precedent for Israeli exports to Egypt even though it's – it would be an existing pipeline network and so if you get that in place then presumably you've got one big hurdle down on the idea of getting Leviathan gas through some new offshore pipeline to Egypt? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Right because then you would have had approvals on contracts precedent contracts if you will to both neighboring countries that are also going to be important for Leviathan.
Okay.
Thanks a lot guys.
And next we'll move on to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Actually the questions around Israeli exports are what I was aiming for so thanks a lot guys.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Thank you David.
Thank you.
Next let's go onto Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Couple of questions on the DJ.
The first you highlighted $3.8 million well costs for the Wells Ranch 4 500-foot lateral.
I just wanted to see where you think that can go based on the trends in service cost deflation and efficiency gains that you're seeing.
And whether you think as you allocate more capital and drill more wells given the rig efficiencies whether you actually see any upward pressure on costs as more of the operators seem to be willing to allocate or maybe willing to allocate more capital there towards the end of the year.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Okay.
Yeah.
I think Brian as you've pointed out we showed a $3.8 million Wells Ranch cost and case and that's reflective of what we've been experienced or experienced here earlier in the first quarter.
Is there room for it to continue to come down? I'd say probably as we continue to get more efficient but probably worth Gary talking a little bit about how sees that playing out.
Operations</span></strong> Yeah.
I probably feel a little even stronger about it than Dave.
The $3.8 million is what we had in the budget.
We essentially have achieved that by the end of the first quarter.
And when you look at other wells that we drilled in Wells Ranch since then by the end of April we were drilling wells as low as $3.4 million some in the $3.6 million to $3.7 million range.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> This is drilled and complete? Operations</span></strong> Drilled and complete yeah and continuing to drive that cost down.
So one thing worth noting and I think we had it in the notes but when we talk drilling complete numbers whether it's the $3.8 million on the slide or the $3.4 million that we've done since then that really is an all-in cost.
That includes all the pad costs allocated to the wells new facilities allocated to the wells as well as when we get into areas where there's vertical legacy wells that if any prep work needs to be done on those that gets allocated back to the wells.
So that truly is an all-in costs.
I think hitting the $3.4 million in April says a lot about our ability to continue to drive it down especially as we continue to drive drilling times down to those five-day records I mentioned on a normal length lateral and seven days on a long length lateral.
But the cost savings is really coming across the board.
It's coming in drilling efficiencies it's coming in supply cost reductions it's coming in greater utilization of consolidated facilities and we're just going to continue to push it.
We've got a technical limit case that's actually significantly below the $3.4 million even and we're working towards that.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> So I'd say Brian where we are and what we've represented is what we've done now on a fairly consistent basis for the first quarter probably too early to call victory on – beneath that yet but we've getting that we're getting some very good indications that there's more to come there.
Great.
Thanks.
That's helpful.
And then couple of months ago it seems like there was a level of either optimism or hopefulness that there would be some consolidation opportunities that may come up.
I just wanted to see with the oil prices and valuations higher how you're thinking about that and where you see opportunity? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I mean I think like everybody we're continuing to keep our eye open.
We probably with some of our realignment of internal resources we've dedicated some more folks or business development group to continue to proactively look at what would be of interest to us.
I think as far as anything new it would have to be something that would have the scale to be in a core area or add to a core area and it would have to be something that had an inventory that would compete with the inventory we have from an economic development standpoint.
So as like – I'm sure like most everybody else if you've got a position of strength like a financial position that we have you'll continue to look for is there things that would be accretive to your opportunity set.
But too early to tell right now.
Great.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Hi.
Good morning.
I just had a quick question on the Marcellus.
So I just want to make sure I understand the $200 million net reduction in capital is that just effectively deferring new spuds because you've reiterated your completion count and production volumes for the region in 2015? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> It's really a reflection of bringing down that rig activity on both sides the wet gas and the dry gas for the – really the biggest impact of that will be the second half of the year.
And with the efficiencies that we've continued to gain out there too we've continued to build up the inventory of completions.
So it just didn't make sense to continue drilling a lot of wells and stacking up a lot of completions out there at this point in time.
Operations</span></strong> Yeah.
This is Gary.
It's primarily on the drilling side.
I think we've reduced our new wells online in the Marcellus by about four wells for the year.
So it's pretty immaterial mostly on the drilling side.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
Great.
And just one question on the Eastern Mediterranean program with the added capacity from the Ashdod compression project realistically how often do you think you'll be able to take advantage of that additional capacity? In other words do you see foresee enough domestic demand growth to allow for more net sales on top of just seasonal peaking needs for air conditioning in the third quarter? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well we saw I think quarter-on-quarter first quarter versus first quarter last year it was up about 10%.
I think as far as truly using all of that capacity it will just be during peak periods and that can be peak hours of the day or it can be more in the summer.
Third quarter is usually our highest quarter over there so that's probably when we'll see it the most.
The other piece of that that it's important for is it provides more capacity for this interruptible volumes once that's worked out and approved and moving forward.
So that will be the knock-on effect of it.
Pickering Holt &amp; Co.
Securities Inc.</span></strong> Great.
That's helpful.
Thank you.
And next we'll move on to Leo Mariani with RBC.
Hey guys.
I was hoping you could speak to well costs in the Marcellus.
You talked a lot about DJ but can you give us a sense of what type of costs you're seeing today both on an operated non-operated basis and the improvements you've seen? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Okay.
Gary do you want to provide any color on that? Operations</span></strong> Yeah.
I think our drilling and complete in the Marcellus it varies obviously across the basin but the average is probably about $8 million – $7 million to $8 million for a 7 000-foot lateral 8 000-foot lateral in that range.
Okay.
Operations</span></strong> It's pretty much $1 million per 1 000-foot lateral is the way to think about it right now.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Yeah.
Okay.
That's helpful.
And I guess obviously you guys made a conscious effort decision here with your partner to reduce activity.
I'm imagining that probably part of that was due to weak gas prices that we're experiencing here.
Can you talk at all about what type of gas prices you and your partner think you guys would need to see before picking up activity again? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> It might not – I think what you're seeing is reflective now of coming out of winter and where the prices and the outlook for pricing are for the rest of this year coming out of winter.
I think we'll continue to meet with them regularly.
I mean we've got monthly reviews with them and more regular discussion on the longer-term outlook.
And yeah I don't think either of us are prepared to nail down a particular price for a particular activity yet.
Okay.
I guess just I'm going over the second quarter guidance here.
You guys obviously are expecting volumes to come down here in terms of sales volumes.
Could you kind of give us some granularity in terms of the level of maintenance you're expecting in the second quarter if you had kind of a number you could sort of throw out there? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I mean the main part of that I think the vast majority of it is all – or the largest portion of it is the downtime and planned down time in West Africa between the planned downtime and lifting schedules there.
So I think that's kind of approaching 15 000 barrels a day equivalent or so.
And then you have some knock-on effects that as you've got some facilities that have some rig moves and so forth that affect our volumes in the Gulf of Mexico.
So those are the two big things along with the normal seasonal demand decrease as we expect and have seen every year in the second quarter in the Eastern Med.
So I mean that's what it's all attributed to.
No different than we expected going into the year.
Okay.
That's helpful.
And I guess you spoke a lot about well costs coming down in the DJ.
Have you seen anything in terms of improved well performance in the DJ other than just faster drilling times and more costs? Operations</span></strong> Yeah.
I think we continue to gather data from all the testing we did last year.
You'll remember we tested quite a few different completion techniques last year.
And we're starting to zero in on the ones that we are going to implement across the Basin for most of this year.
I think when you look at our performance really in the last six months to nine months with everything that we've tried we're at or above the type curves that we've been expecting to see as we test these downspaced areas.
So I'd say everything is pretty much on track right now.
We'll continue to look for ways to improve the completions going forward.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> And I think I mentioned Leo on my call 11 wells up there in East Pony that we did some different completion on.
And those have been a positive improvement too.
Okay.
That's helpful.
Thanks guys.
Operations</span></strong> That's a combination Leo of really looking for ways where we can continue to drive costs down without impacting the value of the properties.
So those 11 wells in East Pony that are slickwater that saves $100 000 to $200 000 per well off the D&amp;C cost and as Dave said they're performing as expected or better so...
All right.
Thank you.
And we'll take our next question from Paul Grigel with Macquarie.
Inc.</span></strong> Hi.
Good morning.
On the DJ noting that there was the asset sale during the quarter are you looking to sell other assets in the Basin outside of the IDPs? And if so any thoughts on what the use of capital would be if those came to fruition? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> Well I think as you saw from what we sold earlier this year it would be areas that are for us would be long-term development.
They'd be outside of the IDP areas things that we wouldn't have plans for for a number of years and somebody else that may fit into their portfolio sooner.
But there's not a whole lot of that up there that we'd be looking at.
It'd be around the fringes I guess.
I don't know.
Gary any other comment? Operations</span></strong> No.
That's fair to say.
It'd be around the fringes.
There might be some other small deals.
But I wouldn't expect anything of the magnitude of that one anytime soon.
Inc.</span></strong> Okay.
And on the capital budget for the year could you just remind us what your assumption was when you set the budget in terms of service cost reductions and then what you've seen to-date? And if your plan is to continue to reinvest those saving in completions in the DJ area or is it to keep it on the balance sheet going forward? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I mean we'll have the opportunity of – we'll continue to drive savings down to continue to look at which makes most sense which creates more value.
Or as I think when you look at it it was the $2.9 billion was – and when we were looking at the budget we were looking at that relative to a $50 to $55 oil price and we were assuming probably on a full-year basis around 10% if I remember right on the average savings overall on those.
And you see a little higher savings that we're seeing on some of the completion part but you have to look at the total cost.
So I think it's too early for us to adjust anything yet which is why we haven't changed our capital outlook for the year but we'll continue to look at that as we get another quarter under our belt.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Thank you.
And our next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Yeah.
Hi.
Gary in response to Leo's question you addressed this a little bit but I wanted to follow up on it.
You'd said that you're trying different things in the DJ.
And so far pretty much everything has kind of met your expectations.
You were doing a lot of testing on downspacing particularly in Wells Ranch last year and I'm just wondering with the slowdown in the drilling activity has that slowed that whole downspacing process or are you comfortable saying what the level of spacing is at least in Wells Ranch at this point – I realize that it varies across the field.
And if you're not ready to say do you have a timeline on how much data do you think you need to see before you will be? Operations</span></strong> Yeah.
We're not ready to say yet.
I'd say as far as when it'll be probably towards the end of this year.
I think what I would point out is that we said all through last year that we – we're devoting a large part of that program to testing downspacing at 24 wells per section and 32 wells per section and then we wanted to get the wells on and really gather some longer term data and we have ramped that downspacing program almost down to nothing this year.
That has doesn't really have anything to do with the commodity environment; that was the plan all along until we had gathered the data on the pilots that we did last year.
So all of the resource numbers everything we've ever talked about location counts for the field has always been based on 16 wells per section.
We've talked about – we do expect it to be different spacing in different parts of the field.
16 wells per section as an average is certainly still a very good number a conservative number I think.
We see some areas where we do expect it to be greater spacing than that more than 16 wells.
There may be some areas that end up being less than 16 wells and I still feel very comfortable overall with where we're at.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think the other part of that too and Gary alluded to the amount of downspacing of drilling we did last year that we've been bringing wells on now we'll start to have a sense of that across – I think it was all of the initial five IDP areas...
Operations</span></strong> Right.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> ...that we had some downspacing last year.
So it's – we'll get a much larger database here this year to compare and look at beyond just the Wells Ranch area.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
That's helpful.
And to follow up on the slickwater comment sounds like working nicely in East Pony.
Is that potential for the rest of the field as well? Operations</span></strong> I think we'll just have to see Mike.
I think we're definitely seeing encouraging early results in East Pony.
We've done some slickwater tests in the past in other parts of the field and it's been less conclusive I'd say in the other parts of the field.
So we'll just to continue to test things in different areas and see what's the best application in each area.
But East Pony's looking good.
President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> And some of this may evolve too as you're getting down into – in increased density or tighter density where you're not having to carry your proppant as far away from the wellbore and you're getting that higher concentration near the wellbore that may drive some changes in how we use fluids then and just concentrations here.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Great.
Thanks.
And then last one for me the Rhea prospect in the Falklands are you comfortable keeping that 75% working interest or are you looking to sell that down at all? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I mean we're probably comfortable with that for this first well.
I mean we would be looking at a project where we would get down into that 50% or so range overall and we're talking to some folks now out there.
But whether something changes before we drill the well or not is not dependent on drilling of this well.
That's a pretty low-cost well.
I mean it's in – I mean relatively it's in about 1 500 feet of water depth than – and the TD is 9 000 feet or so.
So it's a very nice prospect offsetting some recent discoveries.
So it was a nice addition to the portfolio and somewhat de-risking some of our play types down in that area.
Nicolaus &amp; Co.
Inc.</span></strong> Very good.
Thank you.
And next we'll move on to Gail Nicholson with the KLR Group.
Good morning.
I was just curious as to the standpoint of the lower service cost environment.
Does that accelerate the potential for sanctioning projects in the portfolio still in order to lock in lower costs for long lead items? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think the piece on as far as sanctioning projects would be for those big offshore projects; projects like in the Eastern Med.
It will be dependent on how the pricing environment holds up when we're getting closer to sanctioned.
I think directionally it's heading to where you'd potentially have the ability to lock in some lower cost projects than you would have a year or two ago.
We might have the opportunity just as a reminder like we did coming out of the 2008 2009 period when we were able to lock in kind of Tamar Aseng Alen and take advantage of a lower supply cost service cost environment.
So it's going to be dependent on where we are when we're really getting back to truly negotiating the final agreement.
Okay.
Great.
And then just on the standpoint of the Falklands.
What's the infrastructure like down there? You had mentioned that Cheetah was successful in Cameroon that you did that on relatively quickly.
I was just kind of curious on the – with the Falklands successful find down there what type of timeframe to bring the Falklands (58:37)? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> It would be a much longer timeframe.
You have to have large resources you have to have probably bring in something like an FPSO facility a standalone vessel.
And so it's a little – a much different environment than in Cameroon.
In Cameroon what you mentioned it's in very shallow water.
It's like taking a – putting a – setting a Gulf of Mexico very shallow water platform and you could do that very fast.
Falklands would be a longer time to development.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And we'll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
Hi.
Morning.
Just a quick question acquisitions can you just give us your latest thought as far as what you're seeing what you're thinking et cetera? President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></strong> I think we're still early on this cycle here.
I think we'll – and as I mentioned earlier we'll continue to focus on what would make sense to add to the portfolio but it would have to be accretive from the standpoint that it would be an opportunity that had running room and inventory that competes with our current inventory because we've got a nice inventory already out there.
So I don't know.
It's early to say what that market could look like over time.
I think the benefit is and – that you – part of the benefit both for looking at new opportunities and being able to accelerate our own when you got a deep portfolio is maintaining that financial strength and that's why we've made sure we're in the position we're in now.
All right.
That's all I got.
Everything else has been asked.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session.
At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr.
David Larson for any additional or closing remarks.
Great.
Thanks again everyone for participating on the call and your interest and participation in Noble Energy.
Hope you all have a great day.
This will conclude today's conference.
We appreciate everyone's participation.
